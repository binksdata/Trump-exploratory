President of   the United States and the Prime Minister   of Israel thank you very much   [Music]   thank you today I have the honor of   welcoming my friend Prime Minister   Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House   with this visit the United States again   reaffirms our unbreakable bond with our   cherished ally Israel the partnership   between our two countries built on our   shared values has advanced the cause of   human freedom dignity and peace these   are the building blocks of democracy the   State of Israel is a symbol to the world   of resilience in the face of oppression   can think of no other state that's gone   through what they've gone and of   survival in the face of genocide we will   never forget what the Jewish people have   endured your perseverance in the face of   hostility your open democracy in the   face of violence and your success in the   face of tall arts is truly inspirational   the security challenges faced by Israel   are enormous including the threat of   Iran's nuclear ambitions which have   talked a lot about one of the worst   deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal my   administration has already imposed new   sanctions on Iran and I will do more to   prevent Iran from ever developing I mean   ever a nuclear weapon our security   assistance to Israel is currently at an   all-time high   ensuring that Israel has the ability to   defend itself from threats of which   there are unfortunately many both of our   countries will continue and grow we have   a long history of cooperation in the   fight against terrorism and the fight   against those who do not value human   life America and Israel are two nations   that cherish   the value of all human life this is one   more reason why reject unfair and   one-sided actions against Israel at the   United Nations just treated Israel in my   opinion very very unfairly or other   international forums as well as boycotts   that target Israel our administration is   committed to working with Israel and our   common allies in the region towards   greater security and stability that   includes working toward a peace   agreement between Israel and the   Palestinians the United States will   encourage a peace and really a great   peace deal we'll be working on it very   very diligently very important to me   also something we want to do but it is   the parties themselves who must directly   negotiate such an agreement will be   beside them will be working with them as   with any successful negotiation both   sides will have to make compromises you   know that right   I want the Israeli people to know that   the United States stands with Israel in   the struggle against terrorism as you   know mr. prime minister our two nations   will always condemn terrorist acts peace   requires nations to uphold the dignity   of human life and to be a voice for all   of those who are endangered and   forgotten those are the ideals to which   we all and will always aspire and commit   this will be the first of many   productive meetings and I again mr.   prime minister thank you very much for   being with us today mr. prime minister   thank   President Trump thank you for the truly   warm hospitality you and Melania have   shown me my wife Sarah our entire   delegation I deeply value your   friendship to me to the State of Israel   it was so clearly evident in the words   you just spoke Israel has no better Ally   than the United States and I want to   assure you the United States has no   better Ally than Israel our lives has   been remarkably strong but under your   leadership I'm confident it will get   even stronger I look forward to working   with you to dramatically upgrade our   alliance in every field in security and   technology and cyber and trade and so   many others and I certainly welcome your   forthright call to ensure that Israel is   treated fairly in international forums   and at the slander and boycotts of   Israel are resisted mightily by the   power and moral position of the United   States of America as you have said our   lines is based on a deep bond of common   values and common interests and   increasingly those values and interests   aren't are attacked by one malevolent   force radical Islamic terror mr.   president you've uh you've shown great   clarity and courage in confronting this   challenge head-on   you call for confronting Iran's   terrorist regime preventing Iran from   realizing this terrible deal into a   nuclear arsenal and you've said that the   United States is committed to preventing   Iran from getting nuclear weapons you   call for the defeat of Isis under your   leadership I believe we can reverse the   rising tide of   article Islam and in this great task as   in so many others Israel stands with you   and I stand with you mr. president in   rolling back militant Islam we can seize   an historic opportunity because for the   first time in my lifetime and for the   first time in the life of my country   Arab countries in the region do not see   Israel as an enemy but increasingly as   an ally and I believe that under your   leadership this change in our region   creates an unprecedented opportunity to   strengthen security and advance peace   let us seize this moment together   let us bolster security let us seek new   avenues of peace and let us bring the   remarkable alliance between Israel and   the United States to even greater   heights thank you Thank You mr.   president   thank you again thank you   we'll take a couple of questions David   Rohde   that's Christian Broadcasting David   Thank You mr. president   mr. prime minister both of you have   criticized the Iran nuclear deal and at   times even call for its repeal I'm   wondering if you're concerned at all as   it relates to not just the National   Security Advisor Michael Flynn who is   recently no longer here but also some of   those events that have been going on   with communication of Russia if that is   going to hamper this deal at all whether   or not it would keep Iran from becoming   a nuclear State   and secondly on the settlement issue are   you both on the same page how do you   exactly term that as it relates the   settlement issue thank you   Michael Flynn general Flynn is a   wonderful man I think he's been treated   very very unfairly by the media as I   call it the fake media in many cases and   I think it's really a sad thing that he   was treated so badly I think in addition   to that from intelligence papers are   being leaked things are being leaked   it's criminal action criminal act and   it's been going on for a long time   before me but now it's really going on   and people are trying to cover up for a   terrible loss that the Democrats had   under Hillary Clinton I think it's very   very unfair what's happened to general   Flynn the way he was treated and the   documents and papers that were illegally   I stressed that illegally leaked very   very unfair as far as settlements I'd   like to see you hold back on settlements   for a little bit we'll work something   out but I would like to see a deal be   made I think a deal will be made I know   that every president would like to most   of them have not started too late   because they never thought it was   possible and it wasn't possible because   they didn't do it but Bibi and I have   known each other a long time a smart man   great negotiator and I think we're going   to make a deal it might be a bigger and   better deal than people in the   don't even understand that's a   possibility so let's see what we do   let's part doesn't sound too optimistic   but this says good negotiator that's the   art of the deal I also want to thank   pets I also want to thank Sarah could   you please stand up you're so lovely and   you've been so nice to mommy I   appreciate it very much thank you your   turn   was it Buddha Sega yeah please go ahead   mr. president in your vision for the new   Middle East peace are you ready to give   up of the notion of two-state solution   that was adapted by previous   administration and will you be willing   to hear different ideas from the Prime   Minister's and some of his partners   they're asking him to do for example   annexation of parts of the West Bank and   unrestricted settlement constructions   and one more question are you going to   fulfill your promise to move the US   Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and if so   when and mr. prime minister did you come   here tonight to tell mr. the president   that you're backing off the two-state   solution oh thank you so I'm looking at   two state and one state and I like the   one that both parties like I'm very   happy with the one that both parties   like I can live with either one I   thought for a while the two-state looked   like it may be the easier of the two but   honestly if Bibi and if the Palestinians   if Israel and the Palestinians are are   happy I'm happy with the one they like   the best as far as the embassy moving to   Jerusalem I'd love to see that happen   we're looking at it very very strongly   we're looking at it with great care   great care believe me and we'll see what   happens okay thank you   I read yesterday that an American   official said that if you ask five   people what two states would look like   you'd get eight different answers but   mr. president if you asked five Israelis   you'd get 12 different answers but   rather than deal with labels I want to   deal with substance and it's something   I've hope to do for years in a world   that's absolutely fixated on labels and   non on substance so here's the substance   there are two prerequisites for peace   that I laid out two years several years   ago and I haven't changed first the   Palestinians must recognize the Jewish   state they have to stop calling for   Israel's destruction they have to stop   educating their people for Israel's   destruction second in any peace   agreement Israel must retain the   overriding security control over the   entire area west of the Jordan River   because if we don't we know what will   happen because otherwise we'll get   another radical Islamic terrorist state   in the Palestinian areas exploding the   peace exploding the Middle East now   unfortunately the Palestinians seemingly   reject both prerequisites for peace   first they continue to call for Israel's   destruction inside their schools inside   their their mosque inside the text books   you have to read it to believe it they   even did you know they even deny mr.   president our historical connection to   our homeland and I suppose you have to   ask yourself why why do why are Jews   called Jews well the Chinese are called   Chinese because they come from China the   Japanese are called Japanese because   they come from Japan   well Jews are called Jews because they   come from Judea this is our ancestral   homeland Jews are not foreign   colonialist in Judea so unfortunately   the Palestinians not only denied the   past they also poisoned the present they   named public squares in honor of mass   murderers who murdered Israelis and I   have to say also murdered Americans they   fund they pay monthly salaries to the   families of murderers like the family of   the terrorist who killed Taylor force a   wonderful young American a West Point   graduate who was stabbed to death while   visiting Israel so this is the source of   the conflict the persistent Palestinian   refusal to recognize a Jewish state in   any boundary this persistent rejection   ISM that's the reason we don't have   peace now that has to change   I wanted to change not only have I not   abandoned these two prerequisites apiece   they become even more important because   of the rising tide of fanaticism that   has swept the Middle East and is also   unfortunately infected Palestinian   society so I want this to change I want   those two prerequisites a pieced   substance not labels I want them   reinstated but if anyone believes that   eyes as Prime Minister of Israel   responsible for the security of my   country would blindly walk into a   Palestinian terrorist state that seeks   the destruction of my country they are   gravely mistaken   the two prerequisites of peace   recognition of the Jewish state and   Israel's security needs west of the   Jordan they remain pertinent we have to   look for new ways new ideas on how to   reinstate them and how to move peace   forward and I believe that the great   opportunity for peace comes from a   regional approach from involving our   newfound Arab partners in the pursuit of   a broader peace and peace with the   Palestinians and I greatly look forward   to discussing this in detail with you   mr. president because I think that if we   work together we have a shot and we have   been discussing that and it is something   that is very different hasn't been   discussed before and it's actually a   much bigger deal a much more important   deal in a sense it would take in many   many countries and it would cover a very   large territory so I didn't know you   were going to be mentioning that but   that's now that you did I think it's a   terrific thing and I think we have some   pretty good cooperation from people that   in the past would never ever have even   thought about doing this so we'll see   how that works out okay   Katie from Town Hall where's Katie right   there Katie Thank You mr. president you   said in your earlier remarks that both   sides will have to make compromises when   it comes to a peace deal   you mentioned a halt on settlements can   you lay out   a few more specific compromises that you   have in mind both for the Israelis and   for the Palestinians and mr. prime   minister what expectations do you have   from the new administration about how to   either amend the Iran nuclear agreement   or how to dismantle it altogether and   how to overall work with the new   administration to combat Iran's   increased aggression not only in the   last couple of months but the past   couple of years as well it's actually an   interesting question I think that the   Israelis are going to have to show some   flexibility which is hard it's hard to   do they're going to have to show the   fact that they really want to make a   deal I think our new concept that we've   been discussing actually for a while   is something that allows them to show   more flexibility than they have in the   past because you have a lot bigger   canvas to play with and I think they'll   do that I think they very much would   like to make a deal or I wouldn't be   happy and I wouldn't be here and I   wouldn't be as optimistic as I am I   really think they I can tell you from   the standpoint of Bibi and from the   standpoint of Israel I really believe   they want to make a deal and they'd like   to see the big deal I think the   Palestinians have to get rid of some of   that hate that they're taught from a   very young age they taught tremendous   hate I've seen what they're taught and   you can talk about flexibility there too   but it starts at a very young age and it   starts in the school room and they have   to acknowledge as you know they're going   to have to do that there's no way a deal   can be made of they're not ready to   acknowledge a very very great and   important country and I think they're   going to be willing to do that also but   now I also believe we're going to have   Katie other players at a very high level   and I think it might make it easier on   both the Palestinians and Israel to get   something done okay thank you very   interesting question thank you   you asked about Iran one thing is   preventing Iran from getting nuclear   weapons something that President Trump   and I I think are deeply committed to do   and and we are obviously going to   discuss that I think beyond that   President Trump has led a very important   effort in the past few weeks just coming   into the presidency he pointed out their   violations Iranian violations and   ballistic missile tests by the way these   ballistic missiles are inscribed in   Hebrew Israel must be destroyed the   palace the rather the Iranian Foreign   Minister Zarif said our ballistic   missiles are not intended against any   country no they write on the missile in   Hebrew Israel must be destroyed   so challenging Iran on its violations of   ballistic missiles imposing sanctions on   Hezbollah preventing them making them   pay for the Terrorism that they foment   throughout the Middle East and Beyond   well beyond I think that's a change that   is clearly evident in since President   Trump took office I welcome that I think   it's let me say this   very open I think it's longer we do and   I think that if we work together and not   just the United States and Israel but so   many others in the region who see   eye-to-eye on the on the great magnitude   and danger of the Iranian threat then I   think I think we can roll back Iran's   aggression in danger and that's   something that is important for Israel   the Arab states but I think it's vitally   important for America these guys are   developing ICBMs they're developing it   they want to get to a nuclear arsenal   not a bomb 100 bombs and they want to   have the ability to launch them   everywhere on earth and including and   especially eventually the United States   so this is something that is important   for all of us I welcome the change and I   intend to work with President Trump very   close   so that we can thwart this danger hey   you have somebody well mr. president   since your election campaign and even   after your victory we've seen a sharp   rise in anti-semitic and anti-semitic   incident across the United States and I   wonder what do you say to those among   the Jewish community in the States and   in Israel and maybe around the world who   believe in feel that your administration   is playing with xenophobia and maybe   racist tones and mr. prime minister do   you agree to what the president just   said about the need for Israel to   restrain and to or to stop settlement   activity in the West Bank and a quick   follow-up on my french questions simple   question do you back off from your   vision to the end of the conflict of   two-state solution as you lay out in Bar   Ilan speech or you still support it   thank you well I just want to say that   we are you know very honored by the   victory that we had 306 electoral   college votes we were not supposed to   crack 220 you know that right there was   no way to 221 but then they said there's   no way to 270 and as tremendous   enthusiasm out there I will say that we   are going to have peace in this country   we are going to stop crime in this   country we are going to do everything   within our power to stop long-simmering   racism and every other thing that's   going on a lot of bad things have been   taking place over a long period of time   I think one of the reasons I won the   election is we have a very very divided   nation very divided and hopefully I'll   be able to do something about that and I   you know something that was very   important to me as far as people Jewish   people so many friends a daughter who   happens to be here right now a   son-in-law and three beautiful   grandchildren I think that you're going   to see a lot different   United States of America over the next   three four or eight years I think a lot   of good things are happening and you're   going to see a lot of love you're going   to see a lot of love okay thank you I   believe that the issue of the   settlements is not the core of the   conflict nor does it really drive the   conflict I think it's an issue it has to   be resolved in the context of peace   negotiations and I think that also we   also are going to speak about it   president Trump and I so we can arrive   at an understanding so we don't keep on   bumping into each other all the time on   this issue and we're going to discuss   this on the question you said you just   came back with your question to the   problem that I said it's the label what   is Abu Mazen mean by two States okay   what does he mean a state that doesn't   recognize the Jewish state a state that   basically is open for attack against   Israel you know what are we talking   about we talking about Costa Rica are we   talking about another Iran so obviously   it means different things I told you   what are the conditions that I believe   are necessary for an agreement it's the   recognition of the Jewish state and it's   Israel's Israel's security control of   the entire area otherwise which is   fantasizing otherwise we'll get another   failed state and other terrorist   Islamist dictatorship that will not work   for peace but work to destroy us but   also destroy any hope any hope for a   peaceful future for our people so I've   been very clear about those conditions   and they haven't changed I haven't   changed if you read what I said eight   years ago it's exactly that and I   repeated that again and again and again   if you want to deal with labels deal   with labels all deal with substance and   finally one if I can respond to   something that I know from personal   experience I have known President Trump   for many years and to allude to him or   to his people his team some of whom I've   known for many years too   can I reveal Jared how long we've known   you well it was never small he was   always big was always tall but I've I've   known the president and I've known his   family and his team for a long time and   there is no greater supporter of the   Jewish people and the Jewish state than   President Donald Trump I think we should   put that to rest thank you very much   very nice I appreciate that very much   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you

the the wrong intentions and   it's we've got a lot of bad people out   there dad I just want to thank you and   behalf of the government on behalf of   our country for leaving a strong strong   effort in the courts and we really   appreciate it believe me because you as   you know we don't have an attorney   general we have somebody who's   phenomenons you have sessions she's   gonna be there hopefully soon but i   believe it's about a record for the   length of time that they've delayed the   cabinet these are cabinet members of the   phenomenal people and we haven't had   representation and now we have episode   representation fortunately and dana and   a jeopardy would be very shortly   hopefully but we're having a hard time   getting approvals and it's only a dull   effective it's all politics one person   came up to me a senator Democratic   senator came up to me the other day and   said jeff Sessions is a fantastic man   he's fabulous he's a friend of mine he's   a great great man and a great talent and   we're lucky to happen I said oh great I   guess that means you're voting for him   no I won't be doing that he said   politics doesn't allow me to do this I   thought it was a disgrace if the press   talks loud and hard enough i'll have to   tell you who said that to me he fuck you   you don't want to hear you don't want to   hear it   I'll probably tell you actually so we're   gonna be very tough when crime we're   gonna be very tough on the drugs pouring   in and it's a big part of the crime   we're going to be very strong at the   border we have no choice and going to be   building a wall we're starting very soon   general Kelly will be working with a lot   of you and these fantastic leaders   here's one gotta prove very quickly   along with general mattis he's very very   outstanding and I very much appreciate   that you're here today and Jeff I I   really thank you for leading the effort   the reputation fantastic and it's a   great honor to know you maybe we can go   around will let the press stay for a   little while unless you'd rather leave   with the press rather stay you know just   just so you understand this is a new   phenomenon you're at a live television   all over the world right now so don't   get nervous when you speak okay but I   don't think these things have ever taken   place before but you are on live   television so if you don't want to say   anything you don't have to but if you do   I think it's a good thing to say so   maybe we'll just go around the room well   mr. president thank you so much for   having us here I'm sheriff Carolyn Walsh   from Chester County Pennsylvania and   proud to say Pennsylvania   Commonwealth would put you over the top   shave november leave very proud of that   we don't stop bragging about seven you   are great support thank you and I just   want to thank you for during the   campaign and since the campaign being   such a strong courageous supporter of   law enforcement on the national on the   federal level with the border patrol on   the state level in the counties   municipalities boroughs and particularly   with the elected sheriff counties   because we are the sheriff we are the   people's representative and we are   elected by the people and we greatly   appreciate your strong and continues or   Thank You Carol there's a new sheriff in   town pastor so I hear there's so much   data they always use there's a new   sheriff in town so anyway sure era   levinson rockwall county texas we   appreciate your support very much our   count 85% Republican life so it was   pretty easy for you a very nice AI and   it's been in a border state I have been   to the border of Texas in your number of   times been to the border in Arizona I   clearly understand the problem we have   and previously when we go to the border   and hear what the ranchers and sheriff's   have to say those water sheriffs and   border ranchers it was 180 degrees from   what we heard from the previous   administration and the museum be a big   difference we're very proud to have you   as president and that's only two weeks   okay it's you know a very short period   of time I'm hearing it from a lot of   people people are calling in in there   and people I know that are in the area   this thing that's like day and night   because we're not playing games we're   not playing games with stopping the   drugs from pouring into our country and   poisoning are you so thank you very much   who I appreciated mr. president I'm   Jonathan Thompson the executive director   and CEO of the National sheriffs   Association let me tell you the   difference of six months i sat in this   room in this chair   and I was pleading I was begging for   help today you invited us here to your   home you're offering how you're   delivering an offer and on behalf of our   members across country thank you thank   you very much it's illness appreciate   good mr. president rich Stanek Hennepin   County Minneapolis Minnesota first off   thank you very much as I'm just not away   said next time up by three points in my   state I'm going over the top most   doctors said you know we weren't   supposed to do very well in your state   we want most by one point I say about   wet through one more visit we were one   we were one Minnesota but it was very   close whatever many of us have you back   mr. president and I just want to say   that you know you hit on two topics that   are near and dear to my first is of   opioids right we had 144 people that   died last year as a result of oil boom   opioid overdose thirty-one percent   increase over the year before we need   help 80-plus percent those drugs come to   south of the border everybody knows it I   know you will do something about oil   totally being done with this big   difference and we will do that and you   do have a paper you have a big problem   with the refugees pouring that data yes   we do sir all were asking is what to   doing which is let the courts decide do   what we've been doing the rule of law is   strong and the proper vetting of   individuals is really important to us we   know the betting is much much tougher   now and we need this court case it would   be very helpful to keeping the wrong   people out of our country you understand   that better than anybody so I really   think we're gonna have some good results   it may take a little while and you know   this is a very dangerous period of time   because well everybody's talking and   dealing a lot of bad people are thinking   about hey let's go in right now but   we're being very very tough with the   betting tougher than ever before so sir   I'd sure the Homeland Security Committee   for the National sure   we heard from general kelly yesterday   his message was rare mark right about   this carrying out your directives and we   appreciate that it used to be a   political position you know what general   Kelly's doing Homeland Security of you   remembers like a political position not   anymore now it's in my opinion one of my   truly most important position so he's   doing a great job thank you very much   James yes sir mr. president thank you   that's such an honor to be here I'm   Danny Glick sheriff Laramie County   Wyoming you know there are so many   issues that you'll hear going around   this table one of the ones that probably   isn't if people don't realize is ETA   decisions that have affected our coal   industry our old oil industry in the   West but beyond me it increases a number   of people there jobless and thus   increases our crime statistics and it's   starting to overwhelm us we're very   small out there for the most part and we   don't have the numbers of Deputies   offices in law enforcement they can   sometimes keep up with this I appreciate   what you've done and what you're   planning in the future I think it was   very well publicized and I just   appreciate being late Thank You sheriff   and I will tell you that the EPA you're   right i call it its plot the bloodstream   of our country people can't do anything   people are looking to get approvals for   factories for 15 years and then after   the 50th year that gets voted down   having spent a fortune so that's going   to end we have one of our really great   people as you know Scott is looking to   be approved by the Senate we're still   waiting for that one too it's a disgrace   what's going on but as soon as he gets   involved we're going to unclog the   system and by the way people are going   to get rejected but they're going to get   rejected quickly but for the most part   they're going to be accepted when they   want to do we're going to bring the jobs   back and your state was very very good   to me as you know   I mean they were very very good too man   I appreciate that and just tell the   people we're going to get the system   unclogged and we're going to get it up   as you know I approve two pipelines that   were stuck in limbo forever whose   controversial you know I proved them I   haven't even heard I haven't had one   fall from anybody saying though that was   a terrible thing you did I haven't had   one fo you know usually if I do   something that's like bedroom right I   haven't had one call from anybody and   you know with a lot of jobs in the   Keystone case we have potentially   thirty-two thousand jobs almost   immediately and then as you know I did   the Dakota pipeline and nobody called up   to lunch because it was unfair years of   getting approvals nobody showed up to   fight it this company spends a   tremendous hundreds and hundreds of   millions of dollars and then all of a   sudden people show up to find it not   fair to our companies and I think   everyone's going to be happy in the end   okay so I appreciate it very much   Sheriff great honor to have you here   thank you in salary thank you yes sir   loin mr. president i'm john leighton   sheriff of marion county indiana which   is   very proud of this news and we we as   sheriff this is to me it seems like it's   unprecedented I look back into the   history of the NSA long before myself   and and I I never have I could never   find work if not only the presence of   now the vice president as well has   invited us into your house to to share   some concerns of ours and in about ten   minutes you can see the oval office to   which is that's the other thing you know   people have had meetings here I had the   car company's biggest companies for   General Motors Fiat and they were in   this room often I said oh so you've seen   the Oval Office know we've never been   invited to see the elbows you know with   the Oval offices 10 feet in that   direction 10 feet little Bertha but when   they know we're going there he's on   their biggest people so they were never   invited to the Oval Office and they're   only 10 feet away you would think they   would be invited but you're gonna see   the oval office today further there one   of the main concerns with not just my   office of Sheriff but across the nation   is not mentally ill in the jails and the   people that are being really for lack of   a better term warehouse in our jails   across America because we don't have the   facilities necessary to take care of   them on the outside and and it ends up a   lot of these people go to jail because   the public are the police officer   haven't been mad at it at the time   instead of they need to be in the jail   right now for for very good reason so we   just ate you have in the back of long   listen we do all feel that as anyone   with a badge knows that you do have our   backs and we're looking forward to years   of harmony and taking care of business   for the people with Irish   and and i will say that in the recent   election law enforcement is with me I   mean the numbers were staggering   staggering it was it like gee it's 5149   believe me it was through the roof law   enforcement and military also absolutely   I think generally people in uniform tend   to like me explain it on the way that   than that so chef thank you very much   and i do miss your former governor we do   you have a good new governor Holcomb   this is holden demouth or tourism but   there's one big shoes for him to fill   Mike Pence is in fantastic then I want   to thank you for your service and   amazing the way you just stepped into   the breach and have done such a good job   let's see what happens with the court   case mr. president thank you for the   privilege to serve you in the department   of justice and the American people   they're very honored by it and I want to   thank all the sheriff's here but I guess   our local and state partners you know   it's very important to federal law   enforcement and all the agencies and I   know that Senator sessions we're looking   forward to getting the department will   make that an important priority he wants   to strengthen that bond that you have it   because it's very very important along   poster well thank you very much and you   know one of the things that you know   better than anybody is that we had a   very good victory in Boston so I said to   everybody why don't we use the Boston   case why are we using the busing case   because the Boston victory but its   statutory and some difficult judge for   who wrote that decision had a very good   analysis where he referred to   immigration law and I thought it was a   trick yeah and I think it's the right   and a highly respected judge   i preciate thank you very very much   appreciated mr. president I'll share a   page from hockey and Kenny North   Carolina thank you very very much killa   cod killa good and i just want to say   good we appreciate you being the first   responsibility government's protecting   his people as we was elected by the   people you're like about a people we we   got that when you say there's a new   sheriff in town we relate to that you're   about the rule of law we haven't seen   that in many years and we appreciate   that and I'm taste something that drove   hillary was speaking yesterday for the   sheriff's he might he was telling us   about he went I saw something I had it   seemed forward he went to the border he   looked at the assets and he asked their   law enforcement down there what's going   on and what could help fix the situation   down here so you've got a good team   you're put together listening you got   support a share from across the country   and we appreciate thank you a funny   story so when General Kelly was just   born in now secretary Kelly and I said   you want to have dinner tonight and   we'll talk sir I'm heading to the border   I said I like that better   I said I like that better so he's right   on the ball he's gonna be fantastic just   everybody says same thing thank you   that's very nice up officers boy who's   president Dave Mahoney on the sheriff   Dane County which is Madison Wisconsin   want to thank you for inviting our   nation sheriff's into the White House   you know it's the only elected law   enforcement leaders in our community we   are the most we're engaged in our   community issues dessert and I think   it's important I think there's a strong   message when the president united states   and bites our nation sheriffs in to talk   about those issues that are of   importance that i have you ever happened   to grow with the shows no sir no sir   never happened never yes sir and yet the   murder rate in our country is the   highest has been in 47 years right did   you know that 47 years I used to use   that I'd say that in the speech and   everybody was surprised because the   press doesn't tell it like it is was it   to their advantage to say that but the   murder rate is the highest has been and   I guess from 45 to 47 years and I would   think that you would be invited here and   you would think that you people would be   able to solve at you if you ran Chicago   you would solve that nightmare I'll tell   you but everybody in that world   especially Carolyn would raise their   hand because to allow I mean literally   hundreds of shootings a month it's worse   than some of the places that we that we   read about it at least we have wars   going on it's so sad Chicago's become so   sad a situation on go ahead we go maybe   over to downtown Chicago is sheriff   Stanek mentioned you know the issues of   heroin and opiate addiction I'm   averaging approach 15 overdoses a week   you money   and we help from DEA FBI and our task   forces me and them to be adequately   funded and led by leaders who want to   work collectively that our nation shares   how much a good time is caused you think   by drugs generally for some eighty   percent so without drugs you would have   a whole different ball I have jail over   a thousand beds these mishaps suffer   from chronic and we'll double oh holy   God big league or has it been going on   treat many years well I I've inherited   opiates it has overshadowed here cocaine   which of course has been you know   societies that are number one choice no   it's prescription painkillers and a much   higher level much I the over don't   deserve my child rebel just really   anyone interrupt it used to take 90 days   to take a load of heroin from the border   to get it into the economics mainstream   now it's taking 14 days okay well we'll   have it take infinity okay thank you for   seeking the input and guidance of our   nation sheriff's on issues like   immigration you know my community is   looking for immigration reform an   expedited way or good immigrant to   obtain citizenship in this great food   and I appreciate the invitation today to   join you look forward to working with   you how many of these issues some will   disagree on but far more when I agree   I actually can't believe that we're   having to fight to protect the security   in a court system to protect the   security of our nation I can't even   believe it and a lot of people agree   with us believe me there's a group of   people out there and I mean much more   than half of our country much much more   you're not allowed to use the term   silent majority in it you're not allowed   because they make that into a whole big   deal but there's a group of people out   there massive massive numbers far bigger   than what you see protesting and if   those people have a protested you would   see a real protest but they want to see   our border secure and our country secure   and they want to see people that can   love our country come and not people   that are looking to the country so   anyway Thank You sheriff sheriff john   offered a gift card share Jefferson   County Kentucky global bank president   the National sheriffs okay and my Telo   sheriff's have brought up a number of   points and I'd like to add two to it   that I know or on your plate in the   administration's play the 1033 program   where we were sharing Department of   Defense surplice material that helps us   in our walk they were used in boring   they helped us in Iowa that got severely   curtailed and the other thing is that's   that forfeiture people want to say we're   taking money and without due process   that's not true you know we take money   from don't deal for you're saying okay   so you say the asset taking you used to   do and it had an impact right and you're   not allowed to do it now not it they   have curtailed it a little bit and I'm   sure the folks are and that's illegal   reasons or just political reasons they   make it political and they make it they   make up stories I'd like to   okay there's no reason for that do you   think reason for that I am aware of that   mr. president and we have gotten a great   deal of criticism for the asset   forfeiture which is the sheriff says   frequently was taking narcotics proceeds   and other proceeds of crime but there   has been a lot of pressure on the   department to curtail some of them so   what do you do so in other words they   have a huge stash of drugs so in the old   days you take it we now we criticized   for free taken so who gets it what   happens well what we have you but we   have what is called equitable sharing   where we usually share it with the local   police departments for whatever portion   that they worked on the case and it was   a very successful program very very   popular with the law enforcement   community and now what happens oh well   now where we've just been given up   there's a lot of pressure not to forfeit   in some case the school who would want   that pressure you know I mean other than   my bed people right now who would want   that pressure you would think they'd   want I get this stuff taking it you have   to be careful how you speak I guess but   a lot of pressures coming down to   Congress coming out of Congress I don't   know that that will continue now or not   I think let's say I think Congress is   going to get beat up really badly by the   voters because they've let this happen   and I think badly I think you'll be back   in shape so asset forfeiture we're going   to go back on okay thank you sir I live   in how simple can anything be you all   agree with that I soon right do you even   understand the other side of it no no   it's like something since sort of like   the Iran deal nobody even understands   how the thing like that could have   happened it does nothing profit from   video legal pro   right look so you're going to sell   narcotics and sell illegal drugs in our   country you also cannot profit from that   so we seize those profits do cross so   we're due process legislation or any   executive order so that would you send   in to put that back in business I don't   think we need any executive orders we   just need kind of some encouragement   time to move in that direction good   you're encouraged that's better than   signing executive orders and then these   people take in and they make it look so   terrible though it's so terrible I love   it you're encouraged okay good asset   forfeiture you're encouraged okay yes   sir mr. president we appreciate you   having us here today at the White House   my name is John Kerry Medicare and the   sheriff in Monroe County Georgia and I'm   a past president with the National   sheriffs Association as well currently   share our governmental affairs committee   and I just want to thank you for the   administration working actually on   pieces of legislation and on political   ideas with us it's refreshing and we're   thoroughly we are thoroughly enjoying it   we are currently working with Senator   Grassley on some criminal justice reform   issues and the administration has been   supporting us yes with asset forfeiture   is a bit is a big fucking go for it and   just go for it Daniel tell me if I can't   do it that will suck there's a rut like   they got that message okay that's great   but we appreciate it we appreciate your   ear and we appreciate you taking the   time to sit down and at least talk to us   yeah I appreciate to thank you Jeff   thanks for your support thank you thank   you mr. president vice president greg   shoppin and the sheriff in st. Charles   Parish Louisiana basically a suburban   community outside of New Orleans I have   the honor of representing three thousand   and eight countries and you see the   leadership of our organization these are   the leadership past presidents and and   the future presidents of our agency but   more importantly than that we all   represent and oversee literally a few   hundred thousand deputy sheriff's who   are truly the backbone of law   enforcement this country we have a   bumper sticker the NSA puts out that   says sheriffs and deputies the original   poems of Homeland Security and so that   is a force multiplier those men and   women out there or the tip of the spear   and we stand ready to help and keep this   community safe because that's what we're   all elected to do so we thank you so   thank you thank you very much   great group of people we're going to go   into the Oval Office does anybody have   anything to not even a question a   statement as to how we can bring about   law enforcement in a very good civil   lovely way but we have to stop crying   right would anybody like to make a   statement company really yes my asset   forfeiture we've got a state senator and   Texas it was was talking about   introducing legislation to require   conviction before we could receive that   forfeiture money by that and I told him   that the cartel would build a monument   to him in Mexico if he could get that   lets loose tonight senator why here is   Ned will destroy his career mr.   president okay done you know we have   been invited to the White House before   we've sat at the stable its former   administration this is totally different   not once did the president go around the   room and ask the sheriff's what were   issues that were important to us he or   she in our parts of the country or   rather was an outgoing message about gun   control about other things you asked us   what is important to us whether it's   mental health in the jail's opioid   addiction you hit on them right off the   bed the border immigration betting we   appreciate that that has not that has   not happened before we've been here   before but we've never had a present to   sit down and listen to what it is that   we're facing representing our   constituents and public safety across   this country and that's why we   appreciate that's why we're here today   with you before it was scripted very   much you know Bill Belichick is a great   guy in a friend of mine and he was   telling me but somebody told me that   he'll often times when   to get a player and go to the other   players on the team and say what do you   think of this guy you know they all know   the difference and listen to them and   he's done very well right he's done very   well and essentially that's what we do   you know we're talking to the people   that no I'm not telling you even telling   me like what came up this morning I mean   those a big statement I didn't realize   it was so cold blood but the systems   offline so we're gonna unclog the system   and we're gonna go right now into the   Oval Office would you like to press to   come in with you mr. vice president you   will let them come in you know otherwise   I can sit around waiting for the next   meeting for six hours they don't have   such an easy job I'll tell you they   don't have such as you believe it's a   vampire we're going to take it through   the system it's very important because   very important for the country   regardless of me or whoever succeeds at   a later date we have to have security in   our country we have to have the ability   when you take some place like Syria you   take all of the different people pouring   on me and if you remember Isis said we   are going to infiltrate the United   States and other countries through the   migration and then we're not allowed to   be tough on the people coming in plane   up so we'll see what happens we have a   big court case where well represented   and we're going to see what happens it   is a pretty important thing good and   we'll see really hopefully it doesn't   happen it's common sense you know some   things a law and I'm all in fact   something's a common sense this is   common sense mr. president if he's   unreported are under report   under one reporters on phrases yesterday   but if it's under reporting why do you   think the media is not reporting or   Americans well I am very mountains I   don't have to I have to go because I'm   reported on possibly more than anybody   in the world I don't think you'll say   anything about that I happen to know how   dishonest the media is I happen to know   that stories about me that should be   good for bed you know I don't mind a bad   sort of it's true but I don't like major   stories that should be a positive story   when they make them totally negative I   understand the total dishonesty of the   media better than anybody and I let   people know it i mean the media is a   very very dishonest arm and we'll see   what happens not everybody and i have to   say that i always preface it by saying   not everybody but there's tremendous   dishonesty pure outright dishonesty from   the midea let's go into   [Music]   ok   take off   [Music]   [Music]

Patrick's Day parade I spent a   lot of time at st. Patrick's days   parades over the years I will tell you   that was held in my hometown New York   City on March seventeenth 1762 with each   subsequent year the Irish people marched   past another accomplishment and   celebrated another very hard earned   success and they have had tremendous   success all over the world but in this   country they have had tremendous success   over the years they march past the   beautiful st. Patrick's Cathedral now an   immortal monument to the faith of Irish   Catholics in America they celebrated   their shared success in American society   with the election of John F Kennedy   they fought for America in war and   combat and their battlefield courage has   earned admiration and acclaim throughout   the world have great courage the proud   tradition that started in 1762 has   flourished and is now celebrated by   Americans of all faiths and backgrounds   all across our very beautiful and very   special land as we stand together with   our Irish friends I'm reminded of that   proverb and this is a good one this is   one I like heard it for many many years   and I love it always remember to forget   the friends that proved untrue but never   forget to remember those that have stuck   by you we know that politically speaking   a lot of us know that we know it well   it's a great phrase the people of   Ireland and the people of the United   States have stuck together through good   times and bad times over many centuries   we have built a bond that thrives   inspires and indoors and with us it's   going to be closer than ever before I   can tell you   so as we celebrate our shared history   and our enduring friendship let us   commit ourselves to working together as   we will to build on that bond to the   benefit of our citizens for many more   generations to come thank you god bless   you and may God always and lasting   friendship and relationship we love   Ireland and we love the people of   Ireland thank you very much for being   thank you so much mr. president it is   now my pleasure to introduce aunty shock   our friend Enda Kenny very much   ok   the mr. speaker mr. president mr. vice   president members of Congress   ambassadors friends of ireland   distinguished guests is Kershaw some   circus de Mervan Gila Finola vancha live   in you our son realistic as mentioned a   heron panicked Lina fail appalling   Oracle air I didn't see anything   disparaging about you there what I said   was it's a pleasure for me to be here   along with my wife vanilla to be amongst   this August gathering and on behalf of   the government of Ireland and the people   of Ireland wish you all a very happy st.   Patrick's festival for you all they say   the Irish have the capacity to change   everything I just saw the President of   the United States read from his script   entirely   [Applause]   I was going to see a change is coming   with Paul it's a pleasure thank you for   your visit to ireland when you call to   see me and government buildings with   your family and I know if it's don t   give Kenny when I had the privilege of   speaking to the President on the   telephone very short of his election   asset whom it would be possible to   continue this tradition which began so   many years ago and he said without   hesitation of course followed by the   vice president and you are speaker this   is this is unique occasion for Ireland   first people to have the facility of   being honored by the Speaker of the   House the access to the President of the   United States the vice president most of   the team is something that we really do   cherish it goes back a very long way   from when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan   and all of the others put this together   in the first place so it's a really   important difference and we're very   grateful to stand between these two   flags united in the history and so much   I haven't had the opportunity to present   you with a particular piece of sculpture   which is entitled arrival by John bein   it's a miniature and what is quite large   of what stands out to the United Nations   in New York of the tail and the story in   the history of Irish immigrants after   the famine years so let me congratulate   you president Trump on your election you   beat them all   [Music]   whatever they say elections are tough   going I know a bit through 20 of them   myself but the President and the Vice   President this administration now holds   within its hands the responsibility of   dealing with so many global   international issues in the world that   is changing so rapidly that is so   fragile in so many respects and I know   that you will you will do your utmost to   work in the interest of our common   humanity and you will have the prayers   and the support of the Irish people and   let me test said you and the European   Union in the work that you have to do in   the times of the challenging times ahead   we discussed the kind of driver that the   president uses Titleist nine degree   laughed doonbeg wind off the Atlantic   after all the risks at the top to get   that shot straight and during the course   of this presidency president Trump will   visit Ireland and he said him put the   sticks in the hold of the Air Force One   anyway let me just say if you want see   about our country we've come through a   torrid time a number of years ago when I   took over the government back in 2011   were blocked out of all the markets the   trike you were in town or sovereignty   was gone our hope was gone hemorrhage of   emigration and a fall-off in all   business right across every sector now   because of the sacrifices of the people   and tough choices made were a different   spot unemployment which was 15 to was   now down to six point six percent and   falling employments the highest in 10   years growth rate of five point two   percent last year fourth year running   Ireland's the fastest growing country in   Europe deficit eliminated next year two   million plus walking now I was accused   in cock three weeks ago of blocking up   the Irish roads with people going to   work   as a challenge of a challenge of success   i suppose fair to say as you know mr.   president we got 700 irish firms as   sixty-five percent of the 700 firms   walking in America of a full-time   presence in this market and then now   employ 100000 people across 50 states   and that's because of our our   participation in the European Union and   the confidence that our people have to   expand now beyond their own Shores in   this two-way this two-way at conjures is   to the mutual benefit of our people and   in the United States and let me say that   Ireland and the European Union will   never be anything but a friend to your   country to these United States here   and I want I want you to understand that   all administration's over the last 40   years and Beyond have worked in the   interests of the fragility of our   country we've had our troubles we've had   real difficulties in George Mitchell   spoke last night of the Ireland funds   about the contribution that both Europe   and particularly the United States made   towards putting that fragile piece   together and glad to see Ian Paisley   here and indeed Gerry Adams who have had   their difficulties we put it all   together and have maintained a fragile   peace and that's why it's important that   we recognize the contribution made by   the United States to that piece where we   have no border and where people can live   their lives as wouldn't expect to   contribute to their country and their   economies and all presidents and all   administration's over the years have   have assisted us in that regard while   so we want to protect this peace process   and I know that you're going to work   with us in the in it in that context   also we have agreed with the British   government that there would be no return   to the border as it used to apply years   ago with customs posts on major roads   and every other road blown up or   impossible because of sectarian violence   of that part with it we have banished   that we want to see it remain banished   and the political agreement is no return   to that kind of border of the past and   the challenge is to implement that in a   way that works in the interest of the   people north and south and let me say to   you that as a member of the European   Council what we want to do is to work   with America I believe genuinely with   Europe having created four and a half   million jobs in the last three years   that we can walk to the with the United   States we have more employment here   create opportunities for so many   millions of Americans and it may well be   that in a revised trade agenda that we   can do that to the mutual benefit of 500   million people in the European Union and   your population here across the United   States we will walk with this   administration parlor mr. president mr.   vice president in the interest of   everybody thank you Peter King and thank   you Richie Neal I know you're here   somewhere for the work you've done over   the years with   it may well be that it might be   appropriate for the for the government   of the administration to have a desk   here in Washington which will associate   itself with Northern Ireland so that in   the event of contact having to be made   that there's a voice to answer that you   had in the past envoy's a pointer to   Northern Ireland on a practically a   full-time basis I think we can work now   as a priority to get this executive up   and running in the next in the next   short period but to have continued   connection here with the administration   would be very important I'm sure Peter   and which he will walk at that I just   want to say I had a very this morning   with the vice president and with General   John Kelly as sitting at the table who   were hosted by the Vice President in the   traditional breakfast in the Naval   Observatory didn't get much chance to   eat the breakfast I have to say it's one   of them one of the difficulties in   politics you it's in front of you but   you can't get nearest we did discuss the   question of immigration which is so   important to the fabric of our people   and I know that in this country this is   an issue that the administration and the   president are reflecting upon and that's   something that again we will walk with   you diligently in this regard in the two   sectors that we used to have a facility   for III visas for young people who want   to come to America and to work here but   he discussed that very constructively   this morning and secondly as a part of   the overall immigration reform that the   Irish you have contributed so much would   be part of that and we look forward to   the works that will take place the time   ahead might say that when when Mike   Pence's grandfather landed here in Ellis   Island in 1923 that the contribution had   been made by so many Irish for so many   years it was in 1771 that the friendly   sons of st. Patrick were put together in   Philadelphia and one of their first   honorary members was a young man called   George Washington and seven years later   he handed the first Commission to a   naval officer for John Berry who is   co-founder of the American   Navy and he was joined later by John   Holland who designed the first submarine   and he was followed by Louis Brennan   from my hometown wood in major impact of   the navigation systems for torpedoes and   so many others from Henry Ford through   music and culture and so many other so   many other areas with 22 members of the   American presidents who sat in the White   House and I discuss our Irish blood in   them new following that line sir and   just like to say infinite finality this   is this is what I said to your   predecessor on a number of occasions we   would like this to be sorted it would   remove aboard enough so many people that   they can stand out in the license and   now I am free to contribute to America   as I know I can and that's what people   want I know you reflect on this but I'm   always struck by the American National   Anthem when when it's song before the   great occasions and I suppose being an   emotional Irishman I there the hair is   tingle at the back of your neck when you   hear your your your own national anthem   but for us you know when Old Glory waves   and if your hand on your heart and you   see the land of the free and the home of   the brave our sister as brave as ever   but maybe not as free because of the   four thousand congressional medals of   honor given out to the Defense Forces   over 2000 went to the Irish Americans   so therefore in the Revolutionary War   they beat the daylights out of each   other in fredericksburg and Gettysburg   and oak town and other places in Atlanta   they fought every war for america and   died for market and will continue to do   so all they want is the opportunity to   be free   and this administration working with   Democrats and Republicans I hope can   sort this out once and for all and for   future years you determine what it is   that you want to do as George Mitchell   said last evening you can't return to   open immigration but for the people who   are here who should be here might be   here that's an issue that I'm sure your   administration reflect on and we in   Ireland will give you every assistance   in that regard there are millions out   there who want to play their part for   America if you like who want to make   America grace before so I see Vicki here   in front of me we didn't get as far as   the Kennedy Center the other evening   just only young people the other day   they were on about all the different   things that are happening in the world   and the remainder of the month when a   JFK statements and this is our planners   together we shall save us I we shall   perish in its flames we have work to do   let's ease   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   you   you
36SYbsgc0Cs~Trump TV Network~20170307~President Donald Trump Holds Meeting On Obamacare Replacement with House Deputy Whip Team (3/7/2017)~11901.0~4.59384632111~292.0~33.0~   so I want to thank the members of the   House deputy whip team that would be   very important over the next number of   months we have a great team and we're   going to have a lot of victories a lot   of wins but we have a great team   together we're going to do incredible   things for the great citizens of our   country as I said during my joint   address to Congress and I think you   mostly like that we're witnessing a   renewal of the American spirit a surge   of optimism and a new national pride   which is sweeping across the land I see   it there's such spirit whether it's for   the business things we're doing or   whatever it's such spirit that we   haven't seen in the country in a long   time jobs are pouring back you so what   happened with Exxon where they just   announced the massive jobs program so   we're going to have we're going to have   some fun now we have to remember   Obamacare is collapsing and it's in bad   shape and we're going to take action   there's going to be no slowing down   there's going to be no waiting and no   more excuses by anybody we're all now I   can probably say I'm a politician I'm a   politician so we're going to get it done   and you're the leaders that really will   get it done for all of us and for the   American people Obamacare is in very bad   shape I believe that if we wait two   years it will totally implode it's   really pretty much imploding now steep   when you think but it'll implode and   people will be like please help us   please help us and that will be the   Democrats asking for help they already   are asking for help in the true sense of   the word because it's a disaster the   insurance companies the fling some   states are up over a hundred percent in   costs the deductibles are through the   roof you don't even get to use it so   we're going to do something that's great   and I'm proud to support the replacement   plan released by the House of   Representatives and encouraged by   members of both parties I think really   that we're going to have something   that's going to be much more understood   and much more popular than people can   even imagine it follows the guidelines I   laid out in my congressional address a   plan that will lower costs expand sure   is increased competition and ensure   health care access for all Americans   this will be a plan where you can choose   your doctor this will be a plan where   you can choose your plan and you know   what the plan is this is the plan and   we're going to have a tremendous I think   we're going to have a tremendous success   it's a complicated process but actually   it's very simple it's called good health   care so I want to thank you folks for   being with us today ladies and gentlemen   and we will do something really really   important and really good for the   American people I think it's going to go   very quickly I hope it's going to go   very quickly and as you know after that   we work on the tax cut we're going to be   planning a major tax cut I know exactly   what we're looking at most of us know   exactly the plan it's going to put our   country in great shape and we're going   to reduce taxes for companies and for   people and I can use the word again   massively it's going to be a big tax cut   the biggest since Reagan may be bigger   than Reagan so I look forward I really   look forward to working on that but we   can't really get to that unfortunately   because of the way your system works we   can't get to that until we take care of   health care so we'll take care of the   health care i appreciate your great   support and let's get it done thank you   thank you all fantastic thank you well   mr. president thank you for having our   deputy whip team to the White House and   thank you for your commitment on   following through on what the most   Americans tried one of the most   important promises that were made not   only by you but by all of us in getting   this majority both in House and Senate   and the White House and that is rescuing   the American people from the failures of   Obamacare we've heard the message for   years we've seen the dramatically sky   radicand costs you're seeing   double-digit increases every year in   most parts of the country and health   premiums for families many families are   seeing deductibles that rise above the   ten-thousand-dollar range which means   people don't have access to health care   people don't have the ability to choose   their own doctor you talked about this   the other night and just one of the best   speeches I've heard from a president   standing at that well in the house   chamber when you address the joint   session and gave an inspirational speech   the country laying out the things that   need to happen in that you're going to   do to get this country back on track   it's a create jobs into secure America   but one of the things you talked about   is how it's wrong that unelected   bureaucrats in Washington have the   ability to tell you what you can and   can't buy for your family and health   care one of the most personal decision   families make this bill finally starts   the process of not only repealing   Obamacare but also replacing with   returns that put patients back in charge   of their health care decisions that   lower costs for family let them actually   choose the decisions between them and   their doctor which are so personal and   so as we start this process the people   in this room the chief deputy whips are   the ones that are going to be working   directly with members to ultimately pass   this bill to your desk so that we can   quickly provide that relief from   Obamacare to the people of the United   States and I know we are honored to have   our former House colleague and now our   vice president united states who have   been involved in this fight from the   beginning as well vice president mike   pence 20 us to thank you vice president   thank you very much David again we're   going to work quickly it's a it's a   great deal we're going to we're going to   have tremendous believe we're going to   have tremendous support I'm already   seeing the support not only in this room   I'm seeing it from everybody and I'm   seeing it from the public and they want   Obamacare over I got elected to a   certain extent i would say pretty good a   little chunk based on the fact repeal   and replace Obamacare and many of you   people are in the same boat very   important so let's get it done thank you   all very much for being here thank you   okay thank you thank you thank you thank   you   you

the name of George Washington and a   monument stands to one of the world's   greatest heroes Ronald Reagan and so I   am here today not just to visit an old   ally but to hold it up as an example for   others who seek freedom and who wish to   summon the courage and the will to   defend our civilization the story of   Poland is the story of a people who have   never lost hope who have never been   broken and who have never ever forgotten   who they are   [Applause]   thank you so much thank you thank you so   much   such a great honor this is the nation   more than 1000 years old your borders   were erased for more than a century and   only restore just one century ago in   1920 in the miracle of Vistula Poland   stopped the Soviet Army bent on European   conquest then 19 years later in 1939 you   were invaded yet again this time by Nazi   Germany from the west and the Soviet   Union from the east that's trouble   that's tough under a double occupation   the Polish people endured evils beyond   description the cat in forest massacre   the occupations the Holocaust the Warsaw   Ghetto and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising   the destruction of this beautiful   capital city and the deaths of nearly 1   in 5 Polish people a vibrant Jewish   population the largest in Europe was   reduced to almost nothing   after the Nazis systematically murdered   millions of Poland's Jewish citizens   along with countless others during that   brutal occupation in the summer of 1944   the Nazi and Soviet armies we're   preparing for a terrible and bloody   battle right here in Warsaw amid that   hell on earth the citizens of Poland   rose up to defend their homeland I am   deeply honored to be joined on stage   today by veterans and heroes of the   Warsaw Uprising   [Applause]   what great spirit we salute your noble   sacrifice and we pledge to always   remember you fight for Poland and for   freedom thank you thank you   this monument reminds us that more than   150 thousand poles died during that   desperate struggle to overthrow   oppression from the other side of the   river the Soviet armed forces stopped   and waited   they watched at them as the Nazis   ruthlessly destroyed the city viciously   murdering men women and children they   tried to destroy this nation forever by   shattering its will to survive but there   is a courage and a strength deep in the   Polish character that no one could   destroy the Polish martyr Bishop Michael   Cosel said it well more horrifying than   a defeat of arms is a collapse of the   human spirit through four decades of   communist rule Poland and the other   captive nations of Europe endured a   brutal campaign to demolish freedom your   faith your laws your history your   identity indeed the very essence of your   culture and your humanity yet through it   all you never lost that spirit   your oppressors tried to break you but   Poland could not be broken and when the   day came on June 2nd 1979 and 1 million   poles gathered around victory Square for   the very first mass with their Polish   Pope that day every communist and Warsaw   must have known that their repressive   system would soon come crashing down   they must have known it at the exact   moment during pope john paul ii sermon   when a million polish men women and   children suddenly raised their voices in   a single prayer a million Polish people   did not ask for wealth they did not ask   for privilege instead 1 million poles   saying 3 simple words we want God in   those words the Polish people recalled   the promise of a better future   they found new courage to face down   their oppressors and they found the   words to declare that Poland would be   Poland once again as I stand here today   before this incredible crowd is faithful   nation we can still hear those voices   that echo through history their message   is as true today as ever the people of   Poland the people of America and the   people of Europe still cry out we want   God   together with Pope John Paul the second   the polls reasserted their identity as a   nation devoted to God and with that   powerful declaration of who you are you   came to understand what to do and how to   live you stood in solidarity against   oppression against a lawless secret   police against a cruel and wicked system   that impoverished your cities and   yourselves and you won Poland prevailed   Poland will always prevail   [Applause]   thank you   you were supported in that victory over   communism by his strong alliance of free   nations in the West that defied tyranny   now among the most committed members of   the NATO alliance Poland has resumed its   place as a leading nation of a Europe   that is strong whole and free a strong   Poland is a blessing to the nations of   Europe and they know that a strong   Europe is a blessing to the west and to   the world 100 years after the entry of   American forces into world war one the   transatlantic bond between the United   States and Europe is as strong as ever   and may be in many ways even stronger   this continent no longer confronts the   specter of communism but today we're in   the West and we have to say there are   dire threats to our security and to our   way of life you see what's happening out   there they are threats we will confront   them we will win but they are threats   [Applause]   we are confronted by another oppressive   ideology one that seeks to export   terrorism and extremism all around the   globe America and Europe have suffered   one terror attack after another we're   going to get it to stop during a   historic gathering in Saudi Arabia I   called on the leaders of more than 50   Muslim nations to join together to drive   out this menace which threatens all of   humanity we must stand united against   these shared enemies to strip them of   their territory and their funding and   their networks and any form of   ideological support that they may have   while we will always welcome new   citizens who share our values and love   our people our borders will always be   closed to terrorism and extremism of any   kind   we are fighting hard against radical   Islamic terrorism and we will prevail we   cannot accept those who reject our   values and who use hatred to justify   violence against the innocent today the   West is also confronted by the powers   that seek to test our will undermine our   confidence and challenge our interests   to meet new forms of aggression   including propaganda financial crimes   and cyber warfare we must adapt our   alliance to compete effectively in new   ways and on all new battlefields we urge   Russia to cease its destabilizing   activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and   its support for hostile regimes   including Syria and Iran and to instead   join the community of responsible   Nations in our fight against common   enemies and in defense of civilization   itself   finally on both sides of the Atlantic   our citizens are confronted by yet   another danger one firmly within our   control this danger is invisible to some   but familiar to the poles to steady   creep of government bureaucracy that   drains the vitality and wealth of the   people the West became great not because   of paperwork and regulations but because   people were allowed to chase their   dreams and pursue their destinies   Americans poles and nations of Europe   value individual freedom and sovereignty   we must work together to confront forces   whether they come from inside or out   from the south or the East that threaten   over time to undermine these values and   to erase the bonds of culture faith and   tradition that make us who we are if   left unchecked these forces will   undermine our courage SAP our spirit and   weaken our will to defend ourselves and   our societies but just as our   adversaries and enemies of the past   learned here in Poland we know that   these forces too are doomed to fail if   we want them to fail and we do indeed   want them to fail they are doomed not   only because our alliance is strong our   countries are resilient and our power is   unmatched through all of that you have   to say everything is true our   adversaries however are doomed because   we will never forget who we are and if   we don't forget who we are we just can't   be beaten Americans will never forget   the nations of Europe will never forget   we are the fastest and the greatest   commune   there is nothing like our community of   nations the world has never known   anything like our community of nations   we write symphonies we pursue innovation   we celebrate our ancient heroes embrace   our timeless traditions and customs and   always seek to explore and discover   brand new frontiers we reward brilliance   we strive for excellence and cherish   inspiring works of art that honor God we   treasure the rule of law and protect the   right to free speech and free expression   we empower women as pillars of our   society and of our success we put faith   and family not government and   bureaucracy at the center of our lives   and we debate everything we challenge   everything we seek to know everything so   that we can better know ourselves and   above all we value the dignity of every   human life protect the rights of every   person and share the hope of every soul   to live in freedom that is who we are   those are the priceless ties that bind   us together as nations as allies and as   a civilization what we have what we   inherited from artisan and and you know   this better than anybody and you see it   today with this incredible group of   people what we've inherited from our   ancestors has never existed to this   extent before and if we fail to preserve   it it will never ever exist again so we   cannot fail this great community of   nations has something else in common in   every one of them it is the people not   the powerful who have always formed the   foundation of freedom   and the cornerstone of our defense the   people have been that foundation here in   Poland as they were right here in Warsaw   and they were the foundation from the   very very beginning in America our   citizens did not win freedom together   did not survive Horrors together did not   face down evil together only to lose our   freedom to a lack of pride and   confidence in our values we did not and   we will not we will never back down   as long as we know our history we will   know how to build our future Americans   know that a strong alliance of free   sovereign and independent nations is the   best defense for our freedoms and for   our interests that is why my   administration has demanded that all   members of NATO finally meet their full   and fair financial obligation as a   result of this insistence billions of   dollars more have begun to pour into   NATO fact people are shocked but   billions and billions of dollars more   coming in from countries that in my   opinion would not have been paying so   quickly to those who would criticize our   tough stance I would point out that the   United States has demonstrated not   merely with words but with its actions   that we stand firmly behind article 5   the mutual defense commitment words are   easy but actions are what matters and   for its own protection Europe and you   know this everybody knows this everybody   has to know this Europe must do more   Europe must demonstrate that it believes   in its future by investing its money to   secure their future that is why we   applaud Poland for its decision to move   forward this week on acquiring from the   United States the battle-tested patriot   air and missile defense system the best   anywhere in the world that is also why   we salute the Polish people for being   one of the NATO countries that has   actually achieved the benchmark for   investment in our common defense thank   you thank you Poland and must tell you   the example you said is truly   magnificent and we applaud   Poland thank you we have to remember   that our defense is not just a   commitment of money   it is a commitment of will because as   the Polish experience reminds us the   defense of the West ultimately rests not   only on means but also on the will of   its people to prevail and be successful   and get what you have to have the   fundamental question of our time is   whether the West has the will to survive   do we have the confidence in our values   to defend them at any cost   do we have enough respect for our   citizens to protect our borders do we   have the desire and the courage to   preserve our civilization in the face of   those who would subvert and destroy it   we can have the largest economies and   the most lethal weapons anywhere on   earth   but if we do not have strong families   and strong values then we will be weak   and we will not survive if anyone   forgets the critical importance of these   things let them come to one country that   never has let them come to Poland and   let them come here to awesome and learn   the story of the Warsaw Uprising when   they do they should learn about   Jerusalem Avenue in August of 1944   Jerusalem Avenue was one of the main   roads running east and west through the   city just as it is today control of that   road was crucially important to both   sides in the battle for Warsaw the   German military wanted it as their most   direct route to move troops and to form   a very strong front and for the Polish   Home Army   the ability to pass north and south   across that street was critical to keep   the center of the city and the uprising   itself from being split apart and   destroyed every night the poles put up   sandbags amid machine-gun fire and it   was horrendous fire to protect a narrow   passage across Jerusalem Avenue every   day the enemy forces knock them down   again and again and again then the poles   dug a trench finally they built a   barricade and the brave Polish fighters   began to flow across Jerusalem Avenue   that narrow passageway just a few feet   wide was the fragile link that kept the   uprising alive between its walls a   constant stream of citizens and freedom   fighters made their perilous just   perilous Sprint's they ran across that   Street they ran through that Street they   ran under that Street all to defend the   city the far side was several yards away   we called one young Polish woman named   Greta that mortality and that life was   so important to her in fact she said the   mortally dangerous sector of the street   was soaked in blood it was the blood of   messengers Leia's on girls and couriers   nazi snipers shot at anybody who crossed   anybody who crossed they were being shot   at their soldiers burned every building   on the street and they use the poles as   human shields for their tanks in their   effort to capture Jerusalem Avenue the   enemy never ceased its relentless   assault on that small outpost of   civilization and the poles never ceased   its defense the Jerusalem Avenue passage   required constant protection we   air and reinforcement but the will of   its defenders did not waver even in the   face of death and to the last days of   the uprising the fragile crossing never   ever failed it was never ever forgotten   it was kept open by the Polish people   the memories of those who perished in   the Warsaw Uprising cry out across the   decades and fewer clearer than the   memories of those who died to build and   defend the Jerusalem Avenue crossing   those heroes remind us that the West was   saved with the blood of patriots that   each generation must rise up and play   their part in its defence   and that every foot of ground and every   last inch of civilization is worth   defending with your life our own fight   for the West does not begin on the   battlefield it begins with our minds our   wills and our souls today the ties that   unite our civilization are no less vital   and demand no less defense then that   bear shred of land on which the hope of   Poland   once totally rested our freedom our   civilization and our survival depend on   these bonds of history culture and   memory and today as ever   Poland is in our heart and its people   are in that fight just as Poland could   not be broken I declare today for the   world to hear that the West will never   ever be broken our values will prevail   our people will thrive and our   civilization will triumph   thank you so together let us all fight   like the poles for family for freedom   for country and for God thank you God   bless you God bless the Polish people   god bless our allies and God bless the   United States of America thank you god   bless you thank you very much   [Applause]

3N9siiz-b3w~Trump TV Network~20170215~WATCH: President Donald Trump Joint Press Conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu~6327.0~4.14285707474~99.0~27.0~   ladies and gentlemen the President of   the United States and the Prime Minister   of Israel thank you very much   [Music]   thank you today I have the honor of   welcoming my friend Prime Minister   Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House   with this visit the United States again   reaffirms our unbreakable bond with our   cherished ally Israel the partnership   between our two countries built on our   shared values has advanced the cause of   human freedom dignity and peace these   are the building blocks of democracy the   State of Israel is a symbol to the world   of resilience in the face of oppression   can think of no other state that's gone   through what they've gone and of   survival in the face of genocide we will   never forget what the Jewish people have   endured your perseverance in the face of   hostility your open democracy in the   face of violence and your success in the   face of tall arts is truly inspirational   the security challenges faced by Israel   are enormous including the threat of   Iran's nuclear ambitions which have   talked a lot about one of the worst   deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal my   administration has already imposed new   sanctions on Iran and I will do more to   prevent Iran from ever developing I mean   ever a nuclear weapon our security   assistance to Israel is currently at an   all-time high ensuring that Israel has   the ability to defend itself from   threats of which there are unfortunately   many both of our countries will continue   and grow we have a long history of   cooperation in the fight against   terrorism and the fight against those   who do not value human life America and   Israel are two nations that cherish the   value   of all human life this is one more   reason why reject unfair and one-sided   actions against Israel at the United   Nations just treated Israel in my   opinion very very unfairly or other   international forums as well as boycotts   that target Israel our administration is   committed to working with Israel and our   common allies in the region towards   greater security and stability that   includes working toward a peace   agreement between Israel and the   Palestinians the United States will   encourage a piece and really a great   peace deal will be working on it very   very diligently very important to me   also something we want to do but it is   the parties themselves who must directly   negotiate such an agreement will be   beside them will be working with them as   with any successful negotiation both   sides will have to make compromises you   know that right   I want the Israeli people to know that   the United States stands with Israel in   the struggle against terrorism as you   know mr. prime minister our two nations   will always condemn terrorist acts peace   requires nations to uphold the dignity   of human life and to be a voice for all   of those who are endangered and   forgotten those are the ideals to which   we all and will always aspire and commit   this will be the first of many   productive meetings and I again mr.   prime minister thank you very much for   being with us today mr. prime minister   thank   president Trump thank you for the truly   warm hospitality you and Melania have   shown me my wife Sarah our entire   delegation I deeply value your   friendship to me to the State of Israel   it was so clearly evident in the words   you just spoke Israel has no better Ally   than the United States and I want to   assure you the United States has no   better allied in Israel our lines has   been remarkably strong but under your   leadership I'm confident it will get   even stronger I look forward to working   with you to dramatically upgrade our   alliance in every field in security and   technology and cyber and trade and so   many others and I certainly welcome your   forthright call to ensure that Israel is   treated fairly in international forums   and at the slander and boycotts of   Israel are resisted mightily by the   power and moral position of the United   States of America as you have said our   lines is based on a deep bond of common   values and common interests and   increasingly those values and interests   aren't are attacked by one malevolent   force radical Islamic terror mr.   president you've uh you've shown great   clarity and courage in confronting this   challenge head-on you call for   confronting Iran's terrorist regime   preventing Iran from realizing this   terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal and   you have said that the United States is   committed to preventing Iran from   getting nuclear weapons you call for the   defeat of Isis under your leadership I   believe we can reverse   rising tide of radical Islam and in this   great task as in so many others Israel   stands with you and I stand with you mr.   president in rolling back militant Islam   we can seize an historic opportunity   because for the first time in my   lifetime and for the first time in the   life of my country Arab countries in the   region do not see Israel as an enemy but   increasingly as an ally and I believe   that under your leadership this change   in our region creates an unprecedented   opportunity to strengthen security and   advance peace let us seize this moment   together let us bolster security let us   seek new avenues of peace and let us   bring the remarkable alliance between   Israel and the United States to even   greater heights thank you thank you mr.   president thank you again thank you   we'll take a couple of questions and   David Brody that's Christian   Broadcasting David Thank You mr.   president mr. prime minister both of you   have Kurdish criticized the Iran nuclear   deal and at times even call for its   repeal i'm wondering if you're concerned   at all as it relates to not just the   National Security Advisor michael Flynn   who is recently no longer here but also   some of those events that have been   going on with communication of Russia if   that is going to hamper this deal at all   whether or not it would keep Iran from   becoming a nuclear State and secondly on   the settlement issue are you both on the   same page how do you exactly term that   as it relates the settlement issue thank   you michael Flynn general Flynn is a   wonderful man I think he's been treated   very very unfairly by the media as i   call it the fake media in many cases and   i think it's really a sad thing that he   was treated so badly i think in addition   to that from intelligence papers are   being leaked things of being leaked its   criminal action criminal act and it's   been going on for a long time before me   but now it's really going on and people   are trying to cover up for a terrible   loss that the democrats had under   Hillary Clinton I think it's very very   unfair what's happened to general Flynn   the way he was treated and the documents   and papers that were illegally I   stressed that illegally leaked very very   unfair as far as settlements I'd like to   see you hold back on settlements for a   little bit we'll work something out but   I would like to see a deal be made I   think a deal will be made I know that   every president would like to most of   them have not started too late because   they never thought it was possible and   it wasn't possible because they didn't   do it but BB and I have known each other   a long time a smart man great negotiator   and I think we're going to make a deal   it might be a bigger and better deal   than people in this room even understand   that's a possibility so let's see what   we do its part doesn't sound too   optimistic but that's a good negotiator   that's the art of the deal I also want   to thank pets I also want to thank Sarah   could you please stand up you're so   lovely and you've been so nice to Milani   I appreciate it very much thank you your   turn was it who dis second yeah please   go ahead mr. president in your vision   for the new Middle East peace are you   ready to give up of the notion of   two-state solution that was adapted by   previous administration and will you be   willing to hear different ideas from the   Prime Minister's and some of his   partners they're asking him to do for   example annexation of parts of the West   Bank and unrestricted settlement   constructions and one more question are   you going to fulfill your promise to   move the US Embassy in Israel to   Jerusalem and if so when I mr. prime   minister did you come here tonight to   tell mr. the president that you're   backing off the two-state solution thank   you so I'm looking at two state and one   state and I like the one that both   parties like I'm very happy with the one   that both parties like I can live with   either one I thought for a while the   two-state looked like it may be the   easier of the two but honestly if Bibi   and if the Palestinians if Israel and   the Palestinians are are happy I'm happy   with the one they like the best as far   as the embassy moving to Jerusalem I'd   love to see that happen we're looking at   it very very strongly we're looking at   it with great care great care believe me   and we'll see what happens okay   thank you I read yesterday that an   American official said that if you ask   five people what two states would look   like you'd get eight different answers   but mr. president if you asked five   Israelis you'd get 12 different answers   but rather that deal with labels I want   to deal with substance and something   I've hope to do for years in a world   that's absolutely fixated on labels and   not on substance so here's the substance   there are two prerequisites for peace   that I laid out two years several years   ago and I haven't changed first the   Palestinians must recognize the Jewish   state they have to stop calling for   Israel's destruction they have to stop   educating their people for Israel's   destruction second in any peace   agreement Israel must retain the   overriding security control over the   entire area west of the Jordan River   because if we don't we know what will   happen because otherwise we'll get   another radical Islamic terrorist state   in the Palestinian areas exploding the   peace exploding the Middle East now   unfortunately the Palestinians diamond   Lee reject both prerequisites for peace   first they continue to call for Israel's   destruction inside their schools inside   their their mosque inside the text books   you have to read it to believe it they   even did you know they even deny mr.   president our historical connection to   our homeland and I suppose you have to   ask yourself why why do why are Jews   called Jews well the Chinese are called   Chinese because they come from China the   Japanese are called Japanese because   they come from Japan well Jews are   called Jews because they come from Judea   this is our ancestral homeland Jews are   not foreign colonialist in Judea so   unfortunately the Palestinians not only   denied the past they also poisoned the   present they named public squares in   honor of   murderers who murdered Israelis and i   have to say also murdered Americans they   fund they pay monthly salaries to the   families of murderers like the family of   the terrorists who killed Taylor force a   wonderful young American a West Point   graduate who has stabbed to death while   visiting Israel so this is the source of   the conflict the persistent Palestinian   refusal to recognize a jewish state in   any boundary this persistent rejection   ism that's the reason we don't have   peace now that has to change I wanted to   change not only have I not abandoned   these two prerequisites of peace they   become even more important because of   the rising tide of fanaticism that has   swept the Middle East and is also   unfortunately infected Palestinian   Society so I want this to change I want   those two prerequisites a piste   substance not labels I want them   reinstated but if anyone believes that   eyes as Prime Minister of Israel   responsible for the security of my   country would blindly walk into a   Palestinian terrorist state that seeks   the destruction of my country they're   gravely mistaken the two prerequisites   of peace recognition of the Jewish state   and Israel's security needs west of the   Jordan they remain pertinent we have to   look for new ways new ideas on how to   reinstate them and how to move peace   forward and I believe that the great   opportunity for peace comes from a   regional approach from involving our   newfound Arab partners in the pursuit of   a broader peace and peace with the   Palestinians and I greatly look forward   to discussing this in detail with you   mr. president because I think that if we   work together we have a shot and we have   been discussing that and it is something   that is very different hasn't been   discussed before and it's actually a   much bigger deal much more important   deal in a sense   it would take in many many countries and   it would cover a very large territory so   I didn't know you were going to be   mentioning that but that's now that you   did I think it's terrific thing and I   think we have some pretty good   cooperation from people that in the past   would never ever have even thought about   doing this so we'll see how that works   out okay Katie from Town Hall where's   Katie right there kitty Thank You mr.   president you said in your earlier   remarks that both sides will have to   make compromises when it comes to a   peace deal you mentioned a halt on   settlements can you lay out a few more   specific compromises that you have in   mind both for the Israelis and for the   Palestinians and mr. prime minister what   expectations do you have from the new   administration about how to either amend   the Iran nuclear agreement or how to   dismantle it all together and how to   overall work with the new administration   to combat Iran's increase aggression not   only in the last couple of months but   the past couple of years as well it's   actually an interesting question i think   that the Israelis are going to have to   show some flexibility which is hard it's   hard to do they're going to have to show   the fact that they really want to make a   deal I think our new concept that we've   been discussing actually for a while is   something that allows them to show more   flexibility than they have in the past   because you have a lot bigger canvas to   play with and I think they'll do that I   think they're very much would like to   make a deal or I wouldn't be happy and I   wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be as   optimistic as I am I really think the   ican tell you from the standpoint of BB   and from the standpoint of Israel I   really believe they want to make a deal   and they'd like to see the big deal I   think the Palestinians have to get rid   of some of that hate that they're taught   from a very young age they taught   tremendous hate I've seen what they're   taught and you can talk about   flexibility there too but it starts at a   very young age and it starts in the   schoolroom   and they have to acknowledge as you know   i can have to do that there's no way a   deal can be made of they're not ready to   acknowledge a very very great and   important country and I think they're   going to be willing to do that also but   now I also believe we're going to have   Katie other players at a very high level   and I think it might make it easier on   both the Palestinians and Israel to get   something done okay thank you very   interesting question thank you you asked   about Iran one thing is preventing Iran   from getting nuclear weapons something   that President Trump and I I think are   deeply committed to do and and we are   obviously going to discuss that I think   beyond that president Trump has led a   very important effort in the past few   weeks just coming into the presidency he   pointed out their violations Iranian   violations and ballistic missile tests   by the way these ballistic missiles are   inscribed in Hebrew Israel must be   destroyed the palace the rather the   Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said our   ballistic missiles are not intended   against any country no they write on the   missile in Hebrew Israel must be   destroyed so challenging Iran on its   violations of ballistic missiles   imposing sanctions on Hezbollah   preventing them making them pay for the   terrorism that they ferment throughout   the Middle East and beyond well beyond I   think that's a change that is clearly   evident in since president Trump took   office I welcome that I think it's let   me say this very openly I think it's   longer we do and I think that if we work   together and not just the United States   and Israel but so many others in the   region who see eye-to-eye on the on the   great magnitude and danger of the   Iranian threat then I think I think we   can   roll back Iran's aggression in danger   and that's something that is important   for Israel the Arab states but i think   it's vitally important for America these   guys are developing ICBMs they're   developing it they want to get you a   nuclear arsenal not a bomb 100 bombs and   they want to have the ability to launch   them everywhere on Earth and including   and especially eventually the United   States so this is something that is   important for all of us I welcome to   change and I intend to work with   President Trump very closely so that we   can thwart this danger hey you have   somebody well mr. president and since   your election campaign and even after   your victory we've seen a sharp rise in   anti-semitic and anti-semitic incident   across the United States and I wonder   what do you say to those among the   Jewish community in the States and in   Israel and maybe around the world who   believe in feel that your administration   is playing with xenophobia and maybe   racist tones and mr. prime minister do   you agree to what the president just   said about the need for Israel to   restrain and to or to stop settlement   activity in the West Bank and a quick   follow-up on my friends questions simple   question do you back off from your   vision to the end of the conflict of   two-state solution as you lay out in   bar-ilan speech or you still support it   thank you well I just want to say that   we are you know very honored by the   victory that we had 306 electoral   college votes we were not supposed to   crack 220 you know that right there was   no way to 221 but then they said there's   no way to 270 and there's tremendous   enthusiasm out there i will say that we   are going to have peace in this country   we are going to stop crime in this   country we are going to do everything   within our power to stop long simmering   racism and every other thing that's   going on a lot of bad things have been   taken place over a long period of time   I think one of the reasons i won the   election is we have a very very divided   nation very divided and hopefully I'll   be able to do something about that and I   you know it was something that was very   important to me as far as people Jewish   people so many friends a daughter who   happens to be here right now a   son-in-law and three beautiful   grandchildren I think that you're going   to see a lot different united states of   america over the next three four or   eight years i think a lot of good things   are happening and you're going to see a   lot of love you're going to see a lot of   love okay thank you I believe that the   issue of the settlements is not the core   of the conflict nor does it really drive   the conflict I think it's an issue it   has to be resolved in the context of   peace negotiations and I think it also   we also are going to speak about it   president Trump and I so we can arrive   at an understanding so we don't keep on   bumping into each other all the time on   this issue and we're going to discuss   this on the question you said you just   came back with your question to the   problem that I said it's the label what   is Abu Mazen meet by two states okay   what does he mean a state that doesn't   recognize the Jewish state a state that   basically is open for attack against   Israel you know what are we talking   about we talking about Costa Rica are we   talking about another Iran so obviously   it means different things I told you   what are the conditions that I believe   are necessary for an agreement it's the   recognition of the Jewish state and its   Israel's Israel's security control of   the entire area otherwise which is   fantasizing otherwise we'll get another   failed state and other terrorist   Islamist dictatorship that will not work   for peace but work to destroy us but   also destroy any hope any hope for a   peaceful future for our people so I've   been very clear about those can   they haven't changed I haven't changed   if you read what i said eight years ago   it's exactly that and I repeated that   again and again and again if you want to   deal with labels deal with labels all   deal with substance and finally one if I   can respond to something that I know   from personal experience I have no   president Trump for many years and to   allude to him or to his people his team   some of whom I've known for many years   to can I reveal Jared how long we've   known you well it was never small he was   always big was always tall but I I've   known the president and I've known his   family and his team for a long time and   there is no greater supporter of the   Jewish people and the Jewish state and   President Donald Trump I think we should   put that to rest thank you very much   very nice i appreciate that very much   associate contact with the Russian soon   [Music]   you   [Music]   you   [Music]

his boundless   energy his optimism and the love he   shows every day for this country and the   American people for these last 100 days   and beyond it is my high honor and   distinct privilege to introduce to you   the President of the United States of   America President Donald Trump   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   you   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   thank you   thank you ladies and gentlemen it is   truly great to be back in the wonderful   beautiful state of Pennsylvania   I love this state and I love the people   of this state it's special and it   carried us to a big beautiful victory on   November a   I want to recognize some of our friends   that have helped us so much congressman   Scott Perry   Jiki Thompson a couple of my originals   Mike Kelly who I watched on television   he was great where's Mike Kelly where is   my Kelly's here someplace   where is he boy were you great on   television this morning   and of course one of our other originals   Congressman Tom marina right thank you   thank you Mike thank you Tom as you may   know there's another big gathering   taking place tonight in Washington DC   did you hear   [Applause]   a large group of Hollywood actors   [Applause]   and Washington media   [Applause]   our consoling each other in a hotel   ballroom in our nation's capital right   now   they are gathered together for the White   House Correspondents Dinner without the   president   and I could not possibly be more   thrilled than to be more than 100 miles   away from Washington swamp spending my   evening with all of you   and with a much much larger crowd and   much better people right right   [Applause]   and look at the media back there they   would actually rather be here I have to   tell you   that's right   [Applause]   Media let's like CNN and MSNBC our fake   news fake news   [Applause]   and they're sitting and they're wishing   in Washington they're watching right now   they're watching and they would love to   be with us right here tonight but   they're trapped at the dinner which will   be very very boring but next year maybe   we'll make it more exciting for them in   Washington who will show up but we have   a good chance of showing up here again   next year too   the truth is there is no place I'd   rather be than right here in   Pennsylvania to celebrate our 100-day   milestone to reflect on an incredible   journey together and to get ready for   the great great battles to come and that   we will win in every case okay we will   wear because make no mistake we are just   beginning in our fight to make America   great again   now before we talk about my first 100   days which has been very exciting and   very productive let's rate the media's   100 days should we do that should we do   because as you know they are a disgrace   according to a morning consult Paul more   than half of Americans say the media is   out of touch with everyday Americans and   they've proven them according to media   Research Center 89% of the media's   coverage of our administration has been   negative and purposely negative and   perhaps that's because according to the   Center for Public Integrity 96% of   journalists who made donations in the   last election gave them to our opponent   does anybody remember who our opponent   was   that was some opponent finally according   to a poll last year from The Associated   Press only 6% of Americans have a lot of   confidence in America that's very bad   that's much lower than Congress by the   way but I'll give you an example of   something really incredible that's right   get them out of here get them out   thank you thank you thank you   do we love our law enforcement or what   and I want to thank the fire marshals   they have a lot of people standing   outside we really maxed out we broke the   all-time record for this arena how old   is this arena this is not a we broke the   all-time record and I don't have a   guitar which is pretty tough   so just as an example of media take the   totally failing New York Times   pretty soon they'll only be on the   Internet the paper is getting smaller   and smaller   you ever notice starting to look like a   comic book it's getting soon but I will   tell you because I watched and I used to   be in the real estate business they sold   their beautiful New York Times building   in Manhattan a Cathedral to journalism   such a beautiful beautiful building for   around a hundred and thirty million   dollars and a group that bought it later   sold it for approximately five hundred   million dollars and now they live in a   very ugly office building in a crummy   location next they buy the Boston Globe   newspaper with losses for 13 billion   dollars invest millions and millions and   millions of dollars to get it going and   in the end they sell it for zero they   give it away and then they write nasty   editorials and op-eds telling me how I   should be handling world events and our   country tell me   but that's what we have they're   incompetent dishonest people who after   an election had to apologize because   they covered it us me but all of us they   covered it so badly   that they felt they were forced to   apologize because their predictions were   so bad you remember their predictions   they lost a lot of people because of the   way they covered so here's the story if   the media's job is to be honest and tell   the truth then I think we would all   agree the media deserves a very very big   fat failing grade   [Applause]   very dishonest people and not all of   them you know we call it the fake dues   not all of them you notice now they're   using everybody's using the word fake   dues   when did you hear it first folks by   contrast for the last 100 days my   administration has been delivering every   single day for the great citizens of our   country whether it's putting our coal   miners back to work protecting America's   steel and aluminum workers we love that   steel and aluminum or eliminating   job-killing regulations we are keeping   one promise after another and frankly   the people are really happy about it   they see what's happening   but to understand the historic progress   that we've made we must speak honestly   about the situation that we and I   inherited because believe me the   previous administration gave us a mess   [Applause]   for decades our country has lived   through the greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world you people know it   better than anybody in Pennsylvania our   factories were shuttered our steel mills   closed down and our jobs were stolen   away and shipped far away to other   countries some of which you've never   even heard of politicians sent troops to   protect the borders of foreign nations   but left America's borders wide open for   all to violate we've spent billions and   billions of dollars on one global   project after another and yet as gangs   flooded into our country we couldn't   even provide safety for our own people   our government rush to join   international agreements where the   United States pays the costs and bears   the burdens while other countries get   the benefit and pay nothing   this includes deals like the one-sided   Paris climate Accord where the United   States pays billions of dollars while   China Russia and India have contributed   and will contribute nothing   does that remind you of the Iran deal   how about that beauty right   [Applause]   on top of all of that it's estimated   that full compliance with the agreement   could ultimately shrink America's GDP by   25 trillion dollars over a 10-year   period that means factories and plants   closing all over a country here we go   again   not with me folks   those are the facts whether we like him   or not   the dishonest media won't print them   won't report them because the Washington   media is part of the problem their   priorities are not my priorities and   they're not your priorities for living   their agenda is not your agenda and I'll   be making a big decision on the Paris   Accord over the next two weeks and we   will see what happens   but they're all part of a broken system   that has profited from this global theft   and plunder of American wealth at the   expense of the American worker we are   not going to let other countries take   advantage of us anymore because from now   on it's going to be America first   and I have to   [Applause]   and I have to just interject because as   you know I've been a big critic of China   and I've been talking about currency   manipulation for a long time but I have   to tell you that during the election   number one they stopped to put more   importantly just to show you the   dishonesty so we have currency   manipulation by China but China is   helping us possibly or probably with the   North Korean situation okay which is a   great thing right and I met with the   president of China at great length in   Florida and we had long long talks hours   and hours and hours he's a good man   now he's representing China he's not   representing us but he's a good man and   I believe he wants to get that situation   taken care of they have tremendous power   and we'll see what happens but the media   said Donald Trump refuses to name China   a currency manipulator now think of this   think of this right now we have to have   a little flexibility so I meet with the   president of China and I say could you   help us out with North Korea you know   you give them ninety three percent of   their different materials that they need   in their food you have a lot of power we   have a great relationship and then the   media said why didn't he call Donald   Trump and why didn't Donald Trump at a   meeting say you're a currency   manipulator so here's the story listen   mr. president will you help us out with   North Korea North Korea but by the way   you're manipulating your currency does   it work right   so so instead of you understand so   instead of saying that let's see what   happens I honestly believe that he's   trying very hard not an easy situation   for China believe me not an easy   situation but we have somebody there   who's causing a lot of trouble for the   world we have China who is really trying   to help as you've seen they've sent back   vast amounts of coal coming out of North   Korea so let's see what happens and I   think it's not exactly the right time to   call China a currency manipulator right   now do we agree with that   [Applause]   but they never say that they say why   didn't he do it so I promise you in my   inaugural address 100 days ago that now   arrives the hour of action and we've   believe me started from day one and that   is what we've delivered 100 days of   action in fact those people and others   are exhausted they've never seen   anything like that they've never seen   anything like this we are ending the   offshoring and bringing back our   beautiful wonderful great American jobs   we are eradicating the criminal gangs   and cartels that have infiltrated our   country you're reading about them all   the time some of you have big problems   with them thank you for that sign blacks   for Trump I love that guy black slicker   thank you thank you   thank you man that's great that's really   cool I appreciate it and we're taking   steps to renegotiate or cancel any   agreement that fails to protect American   interests here are just some of our   great achievements from the first 100   days and I will tell you in addition to   that we have built such strong   foundations with the leaders of foreign   countries and we're set to rock but we   have great relationships with Germany   and Japan and China and so many others   the UK such great relationships that's   part of the process we've appointed and   confirmed a brand new Justice of the   United States Supreme Court   justice Neil Gorsuch who will uphold the   Constitution and the right of Americans   to govern their own affairs and the last   time a new Supreme Court justice was   confirmed in the first 100 days was 136   years ago in 1881 and I was devastated   to hear that because I thought I'd be   the only one to have done that   [Applause]   a long time ago   to protect your jobs and our economic   freedom I immediately withdrew the   United States from the horrible   disastrous would have been another NAFTA   but worse trans-pacific partnership   that would have taken you jobs in   Pennsylvania that I can tell you that   was a total hoax the TPP would have been   a tremendous disaster for our country   and we are not going to surrender   Pennsylvania jobs ever again we've done   that once before it's not going to   happen   we've just launched an investigation   into foreign steel dumping and aluminum   dumping throughout our country we are   reviewing every single trade deal and   wherever there is cheating we will take   immediate action and there will be   penalties and we have with us tonight   Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and   one of the great great people on fair   trade and good trade mr. Peter Navarro   thank you thank you   and we will renegotiate NAFTA and if we   don't get a good deal and a fair deal   for our country and I've been saying for   a long time will either renegotiate or   will terminate I announced the other day   we were going to terminate everybody   said will terminate two people that I   like very much the President of Mexico   Prime Minister of Canada they called up   they said could we negotiate I said yes   we can renegotiate so we'll start a   renegotiation and hopefully it'll be   fair for everybody   and if it's not a fair deal for our   country because you have to understand   we have been on the wrong side of the   NAFTA deal with Canada and with Mexico   for many many years many decades we   can't allow it to happen so we're going   to renegotiate and if we can't make a   fair deal for our companies and our   workers we will terminate NAFTA okay   our directors will put brand-new   Pennsylvania steel into the spine of   America   we voted billions and billions of   dollars in unpaid duties to be collected   at the border from countries that break   the rules and that just started it's   going to be a lot coming in we just want   fairness and I followed through and my   promise and issued a new government   directive to buy American and hire   America   in just these first few months we've   created 99 thousand new construction   jobs 49000 new manufacturing jobs and   27 thousand new mining jobs who were the   miners here the miners finally would   taking care of our miners we love our   miners and we have over 600000 new jobs   and by the way the stock market since   our election is through the roof   I believe from the point of the election   isn't it too bad that the Obama   administration gets a lot of credit for   those couple of months but all right   because we're doing fine but they get   credit for that because people started   going wild with the stock but I believe   we have a record from the time we got   elected from November 8th we have a   record an all-time record for the   biggest increase in the stock market so   I'm very happy about we've removed the   shackles on energy exploration imposed   by the last administration lifting the   restrictions on the production of oil   shale and natural gas and very   importantly for Pennsylvania we have   ended the war on beautiful clean coal   and we are putting our great coal miners   back to work   we love our miners I'm also very pleased   to say that we have finally cleared the   way for the construction of the Keystone   XL and Dakota access pipelines 48000   new jobs   [Applause]   they couldn't get their approvals we got   of their approvals in 24 hours one day   and I want to tell you the heads of   those two companies they didn't know   what the hell happened they said how did   this happen they should go to bed and   say their prayers but that's going to be   approximately 48 thousand jobs my   administration has also scrapped a   job-killing regulation that was   threatening our auto workers we want   more cars made in the USA and that's   going to happen   we've created a new rule which requires   that for every one new regulation two   old regulations must be eliminated and   we have signed massive executive orders   clearing up the environmental   bureaucracy we're going to have jobs and   you're seeing them already we've also   been very busy on the legislative front   which we have gotten no credit for and   yet I am signing away I've signed 29 new   bills a record not surpassed since the   Truman administration   this includes 13 resolutions to   eliminate intrusive federal regulations   the most ever signed in our history in   keeping our promise to our veterans I've   signed legislation to extend veterans   choice and David the head of the   Veterans Administration is here with us   tonight David Chilton   did an incredible job and we've   increased by 42% the approval for   veterans using the choice program I've   also created an office of accountability   at the VA our message to federal workers   is clear if you fail our veterans you   will be held accountable first time   to create accountability across   government I've issued a five-year ban   on federal officials becoming lobbyists   after they leave government service good   I've got a lot of people in my staff are   not exactly happy with that one but   that's okay and I've issued a lifetime   ban on federal officials becoming   lobbyists for a foreign government I've   imposed these bans for a simple reason   it is time to drain the swamp   and that's what we're doing in   Washington DC   perhaps in no area have past government   sold-out special interests and foreign   lobbyists more than on the issue of   immigration year after year you pleaded   for Washington to enforce our laws as   illegal immigration surged refugees   flooded in and lacks vetting threatened   your family's safety and security your   pleas have finally been it all don't   worry we're gonna have the wall don't   worry about   you know we've done so well at the   border a lot of people are saying oh wow   maybe the president doesn't need the   wall we need the wall to stop the drugs   and the human trafficking we need the   wall in just 100 days we have taken   historic steps to secure a border   impose needed immigration control like   you've never seen before is that true   and properly screen and vet those   seeking admission into our country they   are going to come in because they love   our country will not take you them   otherwise we are operating on a very   simple principle that our immigration   system should put the needs of American   workers American families American   companies and American citizens first I   appointed a great military General John   Kelly to lead the department of homeland   security   since my election we've already achieved   an unprecedented 73 percent reduction in   illegal crossings on our southern border   the greatest reduction in the history of   our country and we just started   the world is getting the message if you   try to illegally enter the United States   you will be caught   detained deported or put in prison at it   will happen   as I campaigned across the nation I met   with the grieving mothers and fathers of   children who had been killed viciously   killed violently killed by illegal   immigrants and I made them a promise we   will protect American lives your family   member will not have died in vain   last week we opened an office to support   the victims of immigration crime called   voice to make sure that no American   victim is ever again ignored by their   government not going to happen anymore   and many people are now talking as I   just said and using this tremendous   early progress on the border to say we   don't need the kind of safety that we   really do need including the wall we   need safety we need cameras we need all   of the things that we're going to be   putting in and we need the wall and we   will build a wall as sure as you are   standing there tonight we need the wall   we'll build the wall folks don't even   worry about it go to sleep go home go to   sleep rest assured that's the final   thing we need it we need it and if the   Democrats knew what the hell they were   doing they'd approve it so easy because   we want to stop crime in our country   obviously they don't mind illegals   coming in they don't mind drugs pouring   in they don't mind   excuse me ms-13 coming in we're getting   them all out of here members of Congress   who will be voting on border security   have a simple choice they can either   vote to help drug cartels and criminal   aliens trying to enter the United States   like frankly the Democrats are doing or   they can vote to help American citizens   and American families be safe that's the   choice who do you want to represent you   unfortunately Democrats in Congress have   no leadership they're rudderless Senator   Schumer is a bad leader   [Applause]   I've known of a long time Senator   Schumer's a bad leader not a natural   leader at all   he works hard to study leadership when   you have to study leadership you got   problems and his policies are hurting   innocent Americans and making it easier   for drug dealers to enter our country   Schumer is weak on crime and wants to   raise your taxes through the roof   he is a poor leader known him a long   time and he's leading the Democrats to   doom it said to see for our country   what's happening to the Democrat Party   at the heart of my administration's   efforts to restore the rule of law has   been a nationwide crackdown on criminal   gangs and that means taking the fight to   the sanctuary cities that shield these   dangerous criminals from removal   the last very weak administration   allowed thousands and thousands of gang   members to cross our borders and enter   into our communities where they wreaked   havoc on our citizens as you know the   bloodthirsty cartel known as ms-13 has   infiltrated our schools threatening   innocent children we've seen the   horrible assaults and many killings all   over Long Island where I grew up we have   seen the vicious spread of transnational   gangs into all 50 states and the human   suffering they bring with them I've been   with the parents I've seen the parents   its devastation a very respected general   recently told me that ms-13 are the   equivalent in their meanness to al Qaeda   my administration will not rest until we   have dismantled these violent gangs and   we're doing it rapidly and we're sending   them the hell out of our country we're   sending them back home where they belong   one by one we're finding the illegal   immigrant drug dealers gang members and   killers and removing them from our   country and once they are gone folks you   see what we're doing they will not let   them back in they're not coming back in   this effort to restore safety to our   country we are going to strongly support   the incredible men and women of law   enforcement   I just signed an executive order   directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions   to combat crimes of violence against our   Police and the Department of Justice is   now prioritizing the prosecution of   criminals who attack officers of the law   and we are also working around the clock   to keep our nation safe from terrorism   my administration has taken historic   steps to improve screening and vetting   for those seeking visas to enter the   United States we have seen the attacks   from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino we   have seen the bloodshed overseas you   look at what's happening in other   countries we already have enough   problems to worry about in the United   States which we love so much we don't   need to be admitting people who want to   oppress hurt or kill innocent Americans   they're not coming in so let me state   this as clearly as I possibly can we are   going to keep radical Islamic terrorists   the hell out of our country   so I have a question for you you've been   to a lot of rallies you sit a lot of   rallies first of all is there any place   like a trump rally in offer   so I did this a little bit during the   rally haven't done it a long time who   has heard the poem called the snake so I   have it does anybody want to hear it   again you sure are you sure   [Music]   okay so let's dedicate this to general   Kelly the Border Patrol and the ice   agents for doing such an incredible job   all right this was written by al Wilson   long time ago and I thought of it having   to do with our borders and people coming   in and we know what we're going to have   we're going to have problems we have to   very very carefully vet we have to be   smart we have to be vigilant so here it   is the snake it's called the snake on   her way to work one morning down the   path along the lake a tender-hearted   woman saw a poor half frozen snake his   pretty colored skin had been all frosted   with the do poor things he cried I'll   take you in and I'll take care of you   the border take me you know tender woman   take me in for heaven's sake take me in   Oh tender woman side the vicious snake   she wrapped him up all cozy in a   comforter of silk and laid him by her   fireside with some honey and some milk   she hurried home from work that night   and as soon as she arrived she found   that pretty snake she taken in had been   revived take me in Oh tender woman take   me in for heaven's sake take me in o   tender woman   side that vicious snake she clutched him   to her bosom   you're so beautiful she cried but if I   hadn't brought you in by now oh heavens   you would have died she stroked his   pretty skin again and kissed him   and held him tight but instead of saying   thank you that snake gave her a vicious   bite take me an O tender woman take me   in for heaven's sake take me in Oh   tender woman side the vicious sake I   have saved you cried the woman and   you've bitten me heavens why you know   your bite is poisonous and now I'm going   to die oh shut up silly woman said the   reptile with a grin you knew damn well I   was a snake before you took me in   does that explain it folks does that   explain keeping America safe also means   rebuilding our defenses under the   leadership of general Mad Dog Madison   and he is doing great he's doing great   and by the way he is the man that   recommended general Kelly I said Mad Dog   you got to give me a great general for   the border he gave me a great general   general care we have begun the process   of rebuilding our military and restoring   full readiness we are also protecting   taxpayer dollars I've already saved more   than seven hundred and twenty five   million dollars on a simple order of   f-35 planes I got involved in the   negotiation and there's billions of   dollars to be say on that and many other   things we've also stepped up the fight   against Isis and we will not stop until   Isis has been destroyed at the same time   we've strengthened our friendships and   alliances all around the world   for instance we were very proud to   quietly work with the Egyptian   government last week to ensure that an   American citizen a beautiful young woman   named aya came home after being in an   Egyptian prison for the past three years   she was going to be there for another 28   years President Obama worked diligently   for three years didn't get him out   I met with president el-sisi and it   worked out quickly   and he was great he was great about it   and not only did the court system in   Egypt and president el-sisi let her out   but they let out her husband and they   let out a total of eight people that   were innocent and the role back here   right now now they won't include that in   the hundred days but I'm very proud to   have done it and she's a happy young   woman believe me she's very happy   I said how tough aya was it in that   prison she said you don't want to know   how is a tough prison we're also getting   NATO countries to finally step up and   contribute their fair share they've   begun to increase their contributions by   billions of dollars but we are not going   to be satisfied until everyone pays what   they own and I've been complaining about   that for a long time and it's a lot   different now but they still owe a lot   of money over the last eight years   America's average military and defense   spending was double what all other NATO   countries spent combined not fair as we   work to get other countries to pay their   fair share abroad we will continue our   rebuilding at home we're rebuilding   everything including by the way our   great military we will have the finest   military that we've ever had at any time   in the history of our country   last week my economic team outlined one   of the biggest tax cuts in American   history even bigger than that of Ronald   Reagan we are proposing major tax relief   for the middle class and lowering the   business tax from 35% all the way down   to 15% and you will see companies expand   companies come back into our country   companies not leave our country anymore   because taxes and regulations are so   owners you will see what happens let me   also be very clear in saying that we are   going to save Americans health care and   repeal and replace that disaster known   as Obamacare which is dying dying dying   Obamacare is dead anyway from you know   they always like to compare well what   about about Obamacare is dead it's gone   the increases were massive last year   they're going to be bigger this year and   the insurance companies are fleeing one   of the top people in the insurance   industry said Obamacare is in a death   spiral there's nothing they can do so   they can't compare something to it   because it won't be there very long   believe me can't be there very long it's   not working it's been a failure under   Obamacare we have seen double and triple   digit hikes in premiums and many   Americans left with only a single   insurer to choose from and now many of   those insurers are fleeing also you have   places like the great state of Tennessee   where I left two weeks ago where half of   the state already has no insurance   carrier and many others so Obamacare is   a catastrophe created exclusively by the   Democrats in Congress and they know it's   no good they know it's not working and   by the way we're going to get something   great we're going to get the premium   we're going to get the deductibles way   down we're going to take care of every   single need you're going to want to have   taken care of but it's not going to cost   that kind of money we're going to bring   it down you're going to see it premiums   down we will repeal and replace   Obamacare you watch we're going to give   Americans the freedom to purchase the   health care plans they want not the   health care forced on them by the   government and I'll be so angry   at congressman Kelly and congressman   Marino and all of our congressmen in   this room if we don't get that damn   thing passed quickly   they'll get it done we know them they'll   get it done in all things we are   returning power to the people where it   belongs we're going to defend the Second   Amendment and your right to keep and   bear arms we are going to bring   education local and we are going to end   Common Core we are going to stop federal   overreach and defend the god-given   rights of every American family just   imagine what we could accomplish if we   all started working together to rebuild   this nation the nation that we so dearly   love our jobs will come back home our   dying factories will come roaring back   to life it will be a beautiful thing to   watch   and this is what's going to happen in   the United States of America and it's   going to happen soon and it's actually   already happening   city's small and large will see a   rebirth of hope safety and opportunity   America's children will be taught to   love their country and take pride in our   great American flag and other countries   and you see that happening will finally   treat America and our citizens with the   respect that our country and our   citizens deserve it's time for all of us   to remember that we are one people with   one great American destiny and that   whether we are black or brown or white   we all bleed the same red blood of   patriots   and we all share the same glorious   freedoms of our magnificent country we   are all made by the same Almighty God   as long as we remember these shows we   will not fail we will never fail we are   Americans and the future belongs to us   the future belongs to all of you so with   hope in ourselves and patriotism in our   hearts I say these words to you tonight   on 100 days of devotion hard work and   love for our great country together we   will make America strong again we will   make America wealthy again we will make   America prosper again we will make   America proud again we will make America   safe again and we will make America   great again thank you god bless you   thank you thank you   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   Hey   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   you   [Applause]   [Music]   ah

the gratitude of each and every   American and we all salute you a proud   nation and you're a part of a very very   proud nation which salutes the 195   cadets of the Coast Guard Academy class   of 2017 good job and I understand from   the Admirals that this has been a very   special class you've been trained here   to handle the toughest of situations the   hardest of moments really that you can   experience and the hardest in people's   lives is to help the weak in their hour   of need but even for the Coast Guard   this class has been exceptionally   dedicated to public service you served   breakfast at the local food bank every   single weekday you rebuilt a home with   Habitat for Humanity last year   you let cadets in donating a total of 24   thousand hours a lot of time to   community service you've done amazing   work and in the true Coast Guard fashion   you had fewer people and fewer resources   but you accomplish the objectives and   you did it with skill and with pride and   I'd like to say under budget and ahead   of schedule   we're doing a lot of that now in the   United States government we're doing a   lot of that I won't talk about how much   I saved you on the f-35 fighter jet I   won't even talk about it or how much   we're about to save you on the Gerald   Ford the aircraft carrier that had a   little bit of an overrun problem before   I got here you know that still going to   have an overrun problem we came in when   it was finished but we're going to save   some good money and when we build the   new aircraft carriers they're going to   be built under budget and ahead of   schedule just remember that that it   allow us to build more now of course   there are always a few slip-ups from   time to time you know that for example I   understand that once or twice   first class cadet Bruce Kim whiz Bruce   where's Bruce   ah Bruce how do you do this to yourself   as regimental parking officer might have   accidentally caused a few tickets to be   issued or a few of your cars to be   booted Bruce what's going on with you   but cadets from this day forward we want   everyone to have a clean slate in life   that includes Bruce right   and so for any oversights or small   violations that might have occurred this   year as tradition demands I hereby   absolve every cadet serving restrictions   for minor offenses now Bruce stand up   once again Bruce they saved you Bruce   because they all wanted me to do that   okay thank you Bruce congratulations   first now you're everyone's good job by   the way Bruce don't worry about it   that's the tradition I was forced to do   that you know that don't work this is   truly an amazing group of cadets that   are here today for Commission you could   have gone to school anywhere you wanted   and with very very few responsibilities   by comparison instead you chose the path   of service   you chose hard work high standards and a   very noble mission to save lives defend   the homeland and protect America's   interests around the world you chose the   Coast Guard good choice good choice   you've learned skills they don't teach   at other schools right here on the   grounds of this Academy and also on your   larger campus the open sea that is a   large large campus as the beautiful   campus but the greatest lesson you've   learned at this proud institution is the   knowledge you've learned about yourself   it's the knowledge that each and every   one of you is something very special you   are leaders for the first stormy days of   your Swap summer to your final weeks as   a first-class cadet you have been   expected to take responsibility to make   decisions and to act and I like all   leaders that's exactly what you have to   do you have to act and you have to act   properly and you have to learn how to   act under great great pressure you're   all going to be under great pressure you   have to learn how to respond and to act   under great pressure just days from now   you will put this vital skill into the   service of your ships your sectors and   your country you'll serve as deck watch   officers on our amazing Coast Guard   cutters you'll bring law and order to   the dangerous waters as boating officers   you will block illegal shipments of cash   weapons and drugs you will battle the   scourge of human trafficking something   that people haven't been talking about   one of the big big plagues of the world   not our country only the world human   trafficking Americans will place their   trust in your leadership just as they   have trusted in generations of coast   guard men and women with respect for   your skill with awe at your courage and   with the knowledge that you will always   be ready you are always ready not only   will our citizens trust   your leadership your commanders will   trust you as well the Coast Guard is the   gold standard in delegated   decision-making down to chain command so   just as your instructors have at the   academy your Coast Guard commanders will   explain their vision and then they will   trust you to get the job done just like   I as your president will also trust you   to get the job done it's amazing to   think of the adventures that are about   to begin for you across the country this   month millions of other students are   graduating high school college many   others are wondering just what am I   going to do they're saying to themselves   what are they going to do you know what   you're going to do many many students   are graduating from college right now   they're saying what am I going to do   where am I going to go to work you know   it you picked a good one by the way you   picked a beautiful one a good one and   we're really proud to have you I can   tell you years from now some of them may   look back and ask themselves whether   they've made the right choice whether   they've made the most of the   opportunities they've been given in the   Coast Guard you will face many   challenges and many threats but one   thing you will never have to face is   that question of what will I do when you   look back you won't doubt you know   exactly how you spent your time saving   lives I look at your Admirals I look at   General Kelly I look at some of the   great people in service and I want to   tell you they're excited about life they   love what they do they love the country   they love protecting our country and   they love what they do is that right   good I just think anyone's going to say   no   that would have ruined our speech I   greet people you always know just what   you'll be the leaders are offices of the   United States Coast Guard and when they   see your uniform everyone in the world   will know exactly what that means what   standard and really if you think of it   when you talk about the great sailors   and the great sailors of the world we   have them but what stranded sailor   doesn't feel relief when those red   racing stripes break the horizon   what drifting soul at sea with only a   short time left to live doesn't rejoice   at the sound of those chopper blades   overhead coming back and coming down to   rescue them from death what poison   peddling drug runner the scourge of our   country doesn't tremble with beer when   the might of the Coast Guard comes   bearing down on them in each case we   know the reason America's life-saving   service is on the way the Coast Guard is   truly vital to the United States Armed   Forces and truly vital to our great   country   out of the five branches of our armed   services it's only the Coast Guard that   has the power to break through 21 feet   of rock-solid arctic ice right here the   only ones and I'm proud to say that   under my administration as you just   heard we will be building the first new   heavy icebreakers the United States has   seen in over 40 years we're going to   build many of them we need them we need   them the Coast Guard stands watch and   our ports patrols our waterways and   protects our infrastructure you defend   America in a world of massive and very   grave threats soon some of you will be   leading boardings of suspicious vessels   searching for the most deadly weapons   and detaining criminals to keep our   people safe others of you will work with   partners in scores of countries around   the globe bringing in the full power of   the United States Coast Guard right up   to those distant shores and some of   those shores are very far away to secure   our borders from drug cartels human   smugglers and terror threats Coast Guard   cutters patrol more than 1500 miles   below our southern border a lot of   people didn't know that when enormous   pride hits your heart you realize that   it's with this great skill and   tremendous speed our Coast Guard men and   women interdict dangerous criminals and   billions and billions of dollars worth   of illegal narcotics every single year   your helicopters launch from the decks   of world-class national security cutters   and they chase drug smugglers   at speeds far in excess of 50 knots in   rough seas at high speeds our incredible   Coast Guard snipers take their aim at   the smugglers engines and time after   time they take out the motors on the   first shot they don't like wasting the   bullets right they actually don't your   slice - roaring storms and through   pouring rain and crashing waves is a   place where a few other people will ever   venture exciting exciting but you have   to have it in your heart you have to   love it you love it in the coastguard   you don't run from danger you chase it   and you are deployed in support of   operations in theatres of conflict all   around the world but not only do you   defend American security you also   protect American prosperity it's a   mission that goes back to the earliest   days of the Revenue Cutter service   you've read about that and studied that   today the Coast Guard helps keep our   waters open for Americans to do business   it keeps our rivers flowing with   Commerce and it keeps our ports churning   with American exports you help billions   and billions of dollars in goods to   navigate our country every day you are   the only federal presence on our inland   waterways you police the arteries we   need to rebuild this country and to   bring prosperity back to our Heartland   and we are becoming very very prosperous   again you can see that think of the   glorious mission that awaits you will   secure our harvests our waterways and   our borders you will partner with our   allies to advance our security interests   at home   abroad and you will pursue the   terrorists you will stop the drug   smugglers and you will seek to keep out   all who would do harm to our country all   who can never ever love our country   together we have the same mission and   your devotion and dedication makes me   truly proud to be your   commander-in-chief thank you now I want   to take this opportunity to give you   some advice over the course of your life   you will find that things are not always   fair you will find that things happen to   you that you do not deserve and that are   not always warranted but you have to put   your head down and fight fight fight   never ever ever give up things will work   out just fine   look at the way I've been treated lately   especially by the media no politician in   history and I say this with great purity   has been treated worse or more unfairly   you can't let them get you down you   can't let the critics and the naysayers   get in the way of your dreams   I guess that's why I want thank you I   guess that's why we won adversity makes   you stronger don't give in don't back   down and never stop doing what you know   is right nothing worth doing ever ever   ever came easy and the more righteous   your fight the more opposition that you   will face I've accomplished a tremendous   amount in a very short time as president   jabs are pouring back into our country a   brand new Supreme Court justice who's   going to be fantastic for forty five   years a historic investment in our   military border crossings thank you to   our general are down more than 70   percent in just a short period of time a   total record by the way by a lot we've   saved the Second Amendment expanded   service for our veterans we are going to   take care of our veterans like they've   never been taken care of before   I've loosened up the strangling   environmental chains wrapped around our   country and our economy change so tight   that you couldn't do anything that jobs   were going down we were losing business   we're loosening it up we've begun plans   and preparations for the border wall   which is going along very very well   we're working on major tax cuts for all   we are going to give you the largest tax   cut in the history of our country if we   get it the way we want it and we're   going to give you major tax reform and   we're also getting closer and closer   day-by-day to great health care for our   citizens and we are setting the stage   right now for many many more things to   come and the people understand what I'm   doing and that's the most important   thing I didn't get elected to serve the   Washington media or special interests I   got elected to serve the Forgotten men   and women of our country and that's what   I'm doing   I will never stop fighting for you and I   will never stop fighting for the   American people as you leave this   Academy to embark on your exciting new   voyage I am heading on a very crucial   journey as well in a few days I will   make my first trip abroad as president   with the safety security and interest of   the American people as my priority I   will strengthen all friendships and will   seek new partners but partners who also   help us not partners who take and take   and take partners who help and partners   who help pay for whatever we are doing   and all of the good we're doing for them   which is something that a lot of people   have not gotten used to and they just   can't get used to it I say get used to   it folks   I'll ask them to unite for a future of   peace and opposition for our peoples and   the peoples of the world first in Saudi   Arabia where I'll speak with Muslim   leaders and challenge them to fight   hatred and extremism and embrace a   peaceful future for their faiths and   they're looking very much forward to   hearing what we as your representative   we have to say we have to stop radical   Islamic terrorism   then in Israel I'll reaffirm our   unbreakable alliance with the Jewish   state   in Rome I will talk with Pope Francis   about the contributions of Christian   teachings to the world finally I'll   attend the NATO summit in Brussels and   the g7 in Sicily to promote security   prosperity and peace all over the world   I'll meet scores of leader and honor the   holiest sites of these three great   religions and everywhere I go I will   carry the inspiration I take from you   each day from your courage and   determination to do whatever is required   safe and protect American lives save and   protect American lives we want security   you're going to give us security in just   one example we see how priceless that   gift of life is to the people you touch   every day a few years ago a Coast Guard   helicopter and rescue swimmer took off   in the direction of three terrified   fishermen who clung to their sinking and   burning vessel that day our Coast Guard   heroes did their jobs well they flew   over the scene despite tremendous danger   and extended a helping hand at the   moment it was most urgently needed

industry very very big very   important everybody say what is it let's   keep them let's keep them guessing back   there you've heard me say the words and   I'll repeat them right now my American   and higher American   it's not just a motto it's a pledge it's   a pledge to the working people of this   country the era of economic surrender   for the United States is over it's over   and you see what's already been   happening plants are coming back other   plans that were expected to be built in   other countries are not being built I   just want to tell the leaders they made   some very wise decisions very wise very   wise some plants that were announced   they're not going to be built they're   smart we're going to stand up to foreign   cheating we're going to crack down on   currency manipulation and yes we're   going to use the full economic powers of   our country to protect our workers and   to protect our jobs let me also say how   important it is for me that we have   every segment of this great American   industry represented in our audience   today we have everybody to succeed as a   country we have to work together we have   to fight side by side to protect our   industry and to stop the jobs from   leaving our countries not going to   happen anymore folks we've gone through   it for many many years decades not going   to happen anymore and if it is this   consequences to pay for the companies   that desert us and fire our employees   their consequences   already we're seeing jobs coming back   since my election Ford is announced   seven hundred new jobs coming back to   their plant in Flat Rock Michigan Fiat   Chrysler has announced that they will   create two thousand new jobs in Michigan   and Ohio   and just today breaking news general   motors announced that they're adding or   keeping 900 jobs right here in Michigan   and that's going to be over the next 12   months and that's just the beginning   cooks fact I told them that's peanuts   that's peanuts we're going to have a lot   more they're going to be building new   plants expanding their plans my   administration will work tirelessly to   eliminate the industry killing   regulations to lower the job crushing   taxes and to ensure a level playing   field for all american companies and   workers before NAFTA went into effect by   the way NAFTA a total disaster there   were 280000 auto workers in Michigan   today that number is roughly 165000 and   would have been heading down big-league   if I didn't get elected I will tell you   that right now that i can tell you   plenty of things were stopped in their   tracks they were stopped in their tracks   a lot of bad things were going to happen   a lot of places we're going to get built   and aren't going to get built right now   in other locations the number of auto   plants in the state has been cut by a   third motor city once set the standard   of living for the nation now it has   suffered under the decades of failed   economic decisions that have stripped   our country of its jobs and of its   wealth the trans-pacific partnership   another disaster threatened states like   Michigan Wisconsin Ohio Pennsylvania and   so many others with the loss of   countless more jobs that is why I'm   proud to say I followed through on my   promise and by the way many other   promises you've seen what's happened   many and immediately withdrew the United   States from the TPP I kept my word the   assault on the American auto industry   believe me is over it's over not going   to have it anymore we're setting up a   task force in every federal agency to   identify and remove any regulation that   undermines American auto production and   any other kind of production including   the production of high and low and big   small every form of automobile and truck   during my first week in office I brought   American auto companies to the White   House Mary bearers here mark fields here   Sergio is here and others and none of   them ever got to see the Oval Office   before because nobody took them into the   Oval Office our presidents they employ   tens of thousands of people but I   brought them into the Oval Office   because they're going to be expanding   their companies   but they all told me the same thing they   explained that the previous   administration promised you a so called   midterm review of the federal fuel   efficiency standards it was necessary   because the standards were set far into   the future way way into the future if   the standards threatened auto jobs then   common-sense changes could have and   should have been made just days before   my inauguration the previous   administration cut short the promised   midterm review in an eleventh-hour   executive action today I am announcing   that we are going to cancel that   executive action   we are going to restore the originally   scheduled midterm review and we are   going to ensure that any regulations we   have protect and defend your jobs your   factories were going to be fair we're   going to be fair this is an issue of   deep importance to me for decades I've   raised the alone over unfair foreign   trade practices that have robbed   communities of their wealth and robbed   our people of their ability to provide   for their families they've stolen our   jobs they've stolen our companies and   our politicians SAT back and watched   hopeless not anymore as a private   citizen I looked really with sadness as   massive shipments of foreign cars have   been dumped on to our shores while those   same countries have shut their borders   to our cars we take them come on in   folks come on in no tax don't worry   about it we make cars they don't take us   not anymore   since NAFTA was approved we've lost   nearly one-third of our manufacturing   jobs in the United States since China   entered the World Trade Organization   we've lost sixty thousand factories hard   to believe our trade deficit last year   reached nearly 800 billion dollars who's   making these deals I can take anybody in   the audience you'll do better believe me   these statistics really should have   shaken up Washington to do action but   nothing happened but something did   happen happened on november eighth   believe me it happened happened for you   but the politicians made excuses they've   said these chronic trade deficits have   helped us to win friends abroad i don't   want friends abroad if that's what it's   going to take we don't need friends   abroad for that you ever see that where   they said no no it's good for us because   people like us abroad they don't like us   they think we're stupid people but no   friendship is strengthened through   economic abuse because we have been   abused and no country can long lead the   free world if it does not protect its   industries and care for its people and   protect its borders   America will be respected again and you   as workers will be respected again   believe me you will be respected again   soon now I think it's already happened   our great presidents from Washington to   Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln all   understood that a great nation must   protect its manufacturing must protect   itself from the outside today I will be   visiting the home of andrew jackson on   the 250th anniversary of his birth and   they say my election was most similar to   his 1828 it's a long time ago usually   they go back like to this one or that   one 12 years ago 16 mean 1828 that's a   long way it's a long time ago in   supporting tariffs jackson said i look   at the tariff with an eye to the proper   distribution of labor and to revenue and   with a view to discharge our national   debt we owe 20 trillion dollars 20   trillion dollars with our policies   America cannot be a wealthy country if   special-interest gamed the system to   profit from the exodus of our companies   and from the exodus of our jobs we must   embrace a new economic model let's call   it the American model   under the system we will reduce burdens   on our companies and on our businesses   but in exchange companies must hire and   grow in America they have to hire and   grow in our country that is how we will   succeed and grow together American   workers and American industry side by   side nobody can beat us folks nobody can   beat us   because whether we are rich or poor   young or old black or brown or white we   all believe the same red blood of   patriots   [Applause]   great Americans of all backgrounds built   the arsenal of democracy including the   legendary Rosie the Riveter who worked   here at Willow Run you know that 75   years ago during the Second World War   thousands of American workers filled   this very building to build the great   new airplanes the b-24 Liberator at peak   production listen to this it's not the   country that we've been watching over   the last 20 years they were building one   b-24 every single hour we don't hear   that we don't hear that anymore doing   we'll be back we'll be back soon most   amazing people and while that's   incredible it's a tribute really to the   team work determination and patriotism   that lives on today in each and every   one of you great people you're great   people now these hundreds of acres that   defended our democracy are going to help   build the cars and cities of the future   so I ask you that's fine cuz you're   right so I ask you today to join me in   daring to believe that this facility   this city and this nation will once   again shine with industrial might   I'm asking you to place your faith in   the American worker and these great   American companies   [Applause]   I'm also asking you to respect and place   your faith in companies from foreign   lands that come here to build their   product we love them too right we love   them I'm asking all of the companies   here today to join us in this new   industrial revolution let us put   American workers American families and   American Dreams first once again may God   bless the American worker may God bless   the Motor City and may God bless the   United States of America thank you thank   you thank you everybody   you   you   [Music]

McCarthy   Majority Whip Scalise chairwoman   McMorris Rogers chairman Brady chairman   Walden chairwoman black congressman   McArthur congressman meadows and all the   principled members of Congress who are   standing with us here today on behalf of   President Donald Trump and the first   family welcome to the White House and   thanks to the leadership of President   Donald Trump welcome to the beginning of   the end of Obamacare it was March 2010   seven years ago Democrats passed the   government takeover of health care and   at that time Republicans in Congress   promised the American people that law   would not stand today thanks to the   perseverance the determination and the   leadership of President Donald Trump and   all the support of those gathered here   we've taken a historic first step to   repeal and replace Obamacare and finally   give the American people the kind of   health care they deserve   so today with heartfelt gratitude for   all he has done to keep his word to the   American people and for all he will do   to continue to make America great again   it is my high honor and distinct   privilege to introduce to you the   president of the United States of   America President Donald Trump thank you   thank you Mike thank you thank you very   much this really is the group what a   great group of people and they're not   even doing it for the party they're   doing it for this country because we   suffered with Obamacare I went through   two years of campaigning and I'm telling   you no matter where I went people were   suffering so badly with the ravages of   Obamacare and I will say this that as   far as I'm concerned your premiums   they're going to start to come down   we're going to get this passed through   the Senate I feel so confident your   deductibles when it comes to deductibles   they were so ridiculous that nobody got   to use their current plan this   non-existent plan that I heard so many   wonderful things about over the last   three or four days after that I mean   it's I don't think you're going to hear   so much right now the insurance   companies are fleeing it's been a   catastrophe and this is a great plan I   actually think it will get even better   and this is make no mistake this is a   repeal and a replace of Obamacare make   no mistake about it make no mistake   and I think most importantly yes   premiums will be coming down yes   deductibles will be coming down but very   importantly it's a great plan and   ultimately that's what it's all about we   knew that wasn't going to work I   predicted it a long time ago I said it's   failing and now it's obvious that it's   failing it's dead it's essentially dead   if we don't pay lots of rent some money   over to the insurance companies that   would die immediately so what we have is   something very very incredibly   well-crafted tell you what there is a   lot of talent standing behind me an   unbelievable amount of talent that I can   tell you and you know coming from a   different world and only being a   politician for a short period of time   how am i doing am i doing okay I'm   president hey I'm president   can you believe it right I don't know   it's I thought you needed a little bit   more more time they always told me more   time but we didn't but we have an   amazing group of people standing behind   me they work so hard and they worked so   long and what I said let's do this let's   go out just short little shots reach one   of us and let's say how good this plan   is we don't have to talk about this   unbelievable victory wasn't it   unbelievable so we don't have to say it   again but it's going to be an   unbelievable victory actually when we   get it through the Senate and there's so   much spirit there but I said let's go   out we have a little list of some of the   people and I think after that list goes   if they don't talk too long our first   list we're going to let some of the   other folks just come up and say   whatever you want but we want to brag   about the plan because this plan really   oh   well yet we may but we're just going to   talk a little bit about the plan how   good it is some of the great features I   want to thank Paul Ryan he has worked so   hard and I was joking I said you know   Paul for the last week I've been hearing   Paul Ryan doesn't have it it's not   working with Paul Ryan he's going to get   rid of Paul Ryan then today I heard Paul   Ryan's a genius he's come along you know   the groups have all come together we   have the Tuesday group we have so many   groups we have the freedom caucus we   have and they're all great people we   have a lot of groups but they all came   together really Paul I'd say in the last   3-4 days especially in the last day see   Mark and I see Kevin I see so many   people Jim we just have developed a bond   this has really brought the Republican   Party together as much as we've come up   with a really incredible health care   plan this has brought the Republican   Party together we're going to get this   finished and then we're going as you   know we put our tax plan in it's a   massive tax cut the biggest tax cut in   the history of our country I used to say   the biggest since Ronald Reagan now it's   bigger than that also pure tax reform so   we're going to get that done next and   this really helps it a lot of people   said how come you kept pushing health   care knowing how tough it is don't   forget Obamacare took 17 months Hillary   Clinton tried so hard really valiantly   in all fairness to get health care   through didn't happen we've really been   doing this for eight weeks if you think   about it and this is a real plan this is   a great plan and we had no support from   the other party so I just want to   introduce somebody to say a few words   who really has been I think treated very   unfairly but it no longer matters   because we won and we're going to finish   it off and we're going to go on to a lot   of other things and we are going to have   a tremendous four years and maybe even   more importantly we're going to have a   tremendous eight years but we're going   to start off with just a great first   year and Paul Ryan come up and say a few   words congratulations on a job well done   guys thank you ah first cotton Thank You   mr. president thank you   thank you for your leadership there are   too many people to name who played such   an important role in helping us get to   this part but I want to think of a few   people in particular I want to thank   chairman Greg Walden Kevin Brady Diane   Black Pete sessions and the members of   their committees for all the hard work   they put into getting us to this point I   want to thank all the other members who   contributed to making this the best Bill   possible it really was a collaborative   consensus driven effort I also want to   thank the team here at the White House I   want to thank Tom Price   I want to thank Mick Mulvaney and I   especially want to thank Reince Priebus   we could not have done this without you   gentlemen you guys are the best of   course this would not have been possible   if that weren't for these two gentlemen   behind me this is the fourth presidency   I've served with I have never ever seen   any kind of engagement like this I want   to thank Mike Prince and I want to thank   President Donald Trump for their   personal involvement in working with our   members in working to get this right for   getting this done and getting us to   where we are thank you gentlemen   today was a big day   but it is just one step in this process   an important step we still have a lot of   work to do to get this signed into law   and I know that our friends over in the   Senate are eager to get to work they are   we're going to see that work through you   know why we're going to see this work   through because the issues are just too   important the stakes are just too high   the problems facing American families   are real and the problems facing   American families as a result of   Obamacare are just too dire and too   urgent just this week just this week we   learned of another state Iowa or the   last remaining health care plan is   pulling out of 94 of their 99 counties   leaving most of their citizens with no   plans on the obama market at all what   kind of protection is obamacare if there   are no plans to choose from and this is   a trend that we are seeing all across   the country the truth is this law has   failed and is collapsing premiums are   skyrocketing and choices are   disappearing and it is only getting   worse   spiraling out of control and that is why   we have to repeal this law and put in   place a real vibrant marketplace with   competition and lower premiums for   families that's what the American Health   Care Act is all about it makes health   care more affordable it takes care of   our most vulnerable and it shifts power   from Washington back to the states and   most importantly back to you the patient   like I said we've got a lot of work to   do but one thing is now clear   Republicans are committed to keeping our   promise to lift the burden of Obamacare   from the American people and put in   place a better more patient-centered   system it is my pleasure at this time to   thank in the welcome to the stage   someone who helped make this so possible   our very talented Majority Leader Kevin   McCarthy   remember the very first time I came down   here to see the new president President   Trump we talked about health care you   know what the president said he said   let's not make this partisan don't do   what you think is right for the   Republican Party do what's right for the   American country and today that's   exactly what we did you see if you   simply read the papers from this week   you take politics out of it   and you put people before politics how   do you look in the faces of 94 counties   in Iowa out of 99   we're not that they won't have very many   choices they'll have no choice how do   you care for pre-existing conditions   when there's no care at all or you read   the paper yesterday and you look at   Aetna pulling out of Virginia our to   Tennessee next year with 16 counties   with no care or what about those   families that paid into those 23 coops   that Obamacare created with more than   two billion dollars 18 of them have   collapsed and the only answer that this   American government gives them as a   penalty if you simply look at the facts   more people took the penalty or the   exemption than actually signed up for   Obamacare I did not run to this office   to promote a party I ran for this office   to make this country better yeah and it   would be easy to say no it would be easy   to watch it collapse but I can't look at   those families I don't think that's   right and that's the exact message I got   from this administration so mr.   president I want to thank you I want to   thank you for your leadership I want to   thank the vice president you know I've   only been through a few presidents but   I've never seen someone so hands-on walk   into my office yesterday morning they   say the president's calling again   I pick up the phone I happen to be the   majority leader the former whip I know   my members well the president gives me a   list of who he thinks I would be best to   talk to on the left and he was right mr.   president they all voted for the bill   today is a start today at the start of a   new beginning yes it's about providing   better health care but I happen to have   been a small business owner I listen to   my district you know how many families   no longer have 40-hour job and now have   to take two part-time jobs or how many   small businesses told me but they   couldn't expand anymore because they   were afraid of what Obamacare would do   for them we are going to unshackle build   an economy that people have greater   choice in their health care and protect   pre-existing conditions and I thank you   for that word I want to call up I was   this job before being Majority Whip I   never had to go through a bill like this   and I will tell you being the whip   really isn't one person the deputy whip   should get a lot of credit as well   Patrick McHenry the web ski steve   scalise never gave up answered every   question and the team between Scalise   and McHenry I'd put beyond any team   we've ever had I give you the Majority   Whip Steve Scalise today we took the   first step toward rescuing families from   the failures of Obamacare we've been   seeing a play out all across the country   this isn't some hypothetical discussion   you see families struggling in every   part of our country   I am from families all the time in my   district in Southeast Louisiana sharing   with me stories of double-digit premium   increases every single year when we had   the 27 and a half hour markup before the   House Energy and Commerce Committee   longest they said in the history of   Congress to pass this bill out of   committee we had a long and important   discussion about health care policy in   America and how this isn't about   achieving some kind of political goal   it's about families families who are   struggling under the weight of this law   that doesn't work and so I reached out   to my own constituents and I said share   with me some of the stories and how this   law Obamacare is affecting you   personally and unfortunately I got a lot   of horror stories you know we've talked   a lot about protecting people with   pre-existing conditions in the context   of this bill and there are so many   things multiple multiple layers in our   bill that we passed today that not only   protect people with pre-existing   conditions but actually focus real   targeted money on lowering premiums for   families with pre-existing conditions   and so during the committee hearing   might have been around 3:00 in the   morning   I shared a story of one of those   constituents Chris from Slidell who sent   me a letter and talked about their   family having pre-existing conditions   they have a family member with   pre-existing conditions and how because   of the problems of Obamacare they're   paying double-digit increases but this   is the real story but for families that   have pre-existing conditions that are   truly being hurt by Obamacare one of the   untold stories are the dramatic   increases in deductibles so   a lot of families across the country   that over $10000 deductibles now for   most people that means they really can't   even use the healthcare that they have   in Obamacare and so what Chris told me   was not only when we go to the doctor do   we have to pay so much for our premium   but almost everything we do were paying   out-of-pocket because we've got such a   large deductible so basically I'm paying   a lot of money for health care plan it   doesn't work for me please provide   relief for my family we hear these   stories over and over and what's been so   encouraging about this debate is that   from the very beginning every member of   Congress that's been involved in trying   to get this bill passed has been focused   on two main things and the first one is   lowering premiums for families that are   struggling and the second is making sure   that patients and doctors are the ones   that make their own health care   decisions unelected bureaucrats in   Washington should not have anything to   do with the health care decisions made   between a patient and their doctor and   that ends with this bill and so as we   went through this process and it took   weeks some people wanted it to take a   couple of days but we said we're going   to take the time to get it right because   it affects every person in this country   in every change that was made along the   way made this bill better almost every   change that was made along the way was   focused on lowering premiums of course   you had a lot of other things we wanted   to do we reformed the Medicaid program   one of the most broken parts of health   care anybody will tell you is Medicaid   and so we actually give governors in   states the flexibility to go and be   innovative and do things that will in a   much more targeted way help low-income   families in a way that Medicare is   failing them today that's another   important aspect of this bill but we   wouldn't be here today without the work   in the help of the president and the   vice-president nighted States directly   getting involved because every meeting   we had with members that wanted to get   additional additional components added   to the bill the president Trump said   bring him into the White House I want to   meet with him I want to talk to him   about how we can actually lower premiums   because president Trump's focus from the   beginning was the same thing he knows   Obamacare fails but it's failing because   it's hurting families and he said how   can we lower premiums   how can we give patients more control of   the healthcare and ultimately all of the   meetings that we had along the way that   made this bill better were focused on   those objectives and that's why it's so   important that we got this first step   done today there's a lot of work left to   be done and I look forward to the Senate   taking the action that they need to take   but ultimately getting a bill to   president Trump's desk that he'll sign   that actually rescue families from this   incredibly failed law and put patients   back in charge of their health care   decisions and lower premiums and the man   that led to charge in starting this   process in the committee was the House   Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman   Greg Walden I want to bring him up a   mister please ladies and gentlemen mr.   president mr. vice president it has been   a pleasure and an honor to work with you   hand-in-hand to get this bill to this   point and I want to tell you what a   great team you have and what a great   team I think we have in the Congress and   on the Energy and Commerce Committee and   our subcommittee chair Mike Burgess   might come on out here for a second dr.   Mike Burgess done incredible work on   this as well you've heard a lot about   our goal to get this back to a patient   doctor relationship to make insurance   affordable to every American and   available where they have choices and   lower costs and competition in that   market it is collapsing around a state   by state county by county last year   there were 225 counties in America where   you only had one choice on the Obamacare   exchange this year it's a thousand 22   and you've heard now there are some   counties where you'll have no choice   that's not a portability that's not   access that's not patient care that is   what we're trying to reform in this   legislation you heard about Medicaid   reform I started a Medicaid reform in   the 1989 session of the Oregon   Legislature I helped out there we became   the majority in 90 I was majority leader   in 91 we continued these reforms to   achieve this same goal of trying to get   people care that they needed when they   didn't have it and I continue that   battle today we reached out to   governor's we reached out to insurance   commissioners we reached out the   innovators in this space now I think   about Governor Herbert out of Utah who   told us the story of having to petition   CMS the old CMS not Seema Verma and Tom   prices GM   to see if he could use a modern new   innovative technology to communicate   with his Medicaid recipients who had   that same technology you and I would   know that as email nine months later the   government here in Washington denied his   request to communicate with people who   had email by email   they told him no and I said to the   governor of Utah how much would that   have saved your state he said six   million dollars now do you want to spend   it in snail mail on postage or do you   want to spend it in healthcare but the   bigger question is why do you have to   come to Washington DC to get that kind   of permission to begin with so what this   legislation does is open up the ability   for states to innovate for doctors and   patients and legislators to get together   state by state and make a real   difference for the people of Utah or the   people of Oregon or the people of   Florida we can get this right it is our   duty it is our obligation this is the   first step I look forward to the   partnership with the Senate and   continuing with one with the White House   till we get this signed into law thank   you now it's my great pleasure to   introduce the chairwoman of the Budget   Committee the the chair who put us on   this task a nurse an incredibly capable   legislator Diane Black thank you Greg   some 45 years ago I graduated from   nursing school and when I graduated I   took an oath of honor to develop myself   to those committed to my care and it is   what brought me here to Congress because   I saw almost seven years ago what this   was doing to those in my state the   people who come to me a church that   stopped me in the grocery store that   stopped me wherever I am at a ball field   of my grandchildren to tell me with   tears in their eyes please help us   please help us the premiums have gone up   the deductibles are so high we cannot   even get the care even if we pay our   premiums it was breaking my heart and   has been breaking my heart over those   last seven years now that I've been   hearing this and so this is a great day   for us this is just   beginning we have the opportunity now to   rescue people to give them the   opportunity to truly truly get the kind   of care that they want they deserve with   the doctors that they choose and a price   they can afford and that's what this   celebration is about it's not about   politics it's about looking those people   in the eye the people that were thrown   off of their care in our state 28000   people lost their care in our risk   program in one day just like that and   this is a great day it's just the   beginning there's still more to be done   I'm hopeful that the Senate is even   going to make this bill better there's   so many people to think there are a lot   of them are standing back here but most   of all I want to say thank you to mr.   president and mr. vice president   for being engaged for giving an   opportunity for our members to feel   they're being heard and at the end of   the day to get a project that's really   going to work for the American people   that's what this is all about and now   it's my honor to bring to the podium my   chairman of ways and means   representative Brady Thank You Diann mr.   president mr. vice president I'm proud   on behalf the Ways and Means Committee   on on behalf of our House Republicans   again to say thank you for your   leadership you know I know I know this   is just a first step but make no mistake   this is a giant step toward a day yeah   towards the day when Americans aren't   struggling under one trillion dollars of   tax hikes that hurt small businesses   that land on families that dragged our   economy down that hurt patients under   this new law it's gone   we take a giant step toward a day when   Americans aren't forced to buy health   care they don't want and can't afford   and small businesses are no longer   forced to offer health care their   workers can't afford either and we take   a giant step today to to the moment when   Americans can save in their health   savings plans for those big   out-of-pocket costs and they get a   personal tax   that can go with them from job to job   state to state home to raise a family or   a business even in retirement if they   want we take that big step so Americans   can choose healthcare they need not the   health care Washington thinks they need   so this is a giant step forward now   finished with this we know you have some   big big plans on tax reform bold plans   at least we've heard they're great and I   think they are and make no mistake today   we've taken a giant step toward   delivering bold tax reform that   leapfrogs America into the lead around   the world and simplifies this code like   it's never been done before mr.   president we intend to deliver on that   promise too and I'm proud to introduce   my friend from North Carolina the leader   in the chairman of the freedom caucus   who stayed at the table work to bring   our our conference together mr. mark   meadows there there are three numbers   that matter today 217 1 and 318 today we   had a vote in the house and 217 votes   actually came together from different   districts from all across the country   from Maine to California from Michigan   to Florida and in between and all of   those 217 members came from different   districts that represented a different   kind of people and it's a good day   because of the number one a president   who wouldn't give up a president who got   engaged a president who said you know I   don't care what the mainstream media is   saying we're going to get this done and   we're going to make it better for the   American people and mr. president and   mr. vice president for those late night   calls I'm glad that I'll get some rest   but I want to thank you on behalf of the   most critical number and that's the 318   million Americans who now once again   will be able to get affordable health   care to allow those decisions to be made   between them and their doctor and once   again make sure that they don't have to   go begging and figuring out how to pay   for their health care premium instead of   their mortgage so mr. president it's a   great day for America it's a great day   for this administration but it's a truly   great day for the American people   god bless and I have the honor of   introducing someone that I didn't know   real well before this all happened and I   use the term gentleman in the most   appropriate way the gentleman from New   Jersey my good friend Tom MacArthur well   thank you Mark and hello friends I have   said from the beginning of this long   process that this has to be about people   not about politics I watched my dad who   I love very much he's in the latter   stage of Alzheimer's now but I watched   him all my life   working three jobs to pay off medical   bills because he had no insurance when   my mother died of cancer when I was four   he paid those bills off when I was in   college I remember the day he called me   and told me he had finally lifted that   burden and I was proud of him I'm very   thankful to have had a small part in   moving a bill forward that will help   every American be able to afford   insurance so that nobody has to endure   that   eight years ago we had a president who   faced a really important question how do   we get more Americans insured how do we   help the most vulnerable among us it's a   really important question and he and his   party for all their efforts came up with   the wrong answer the answer was let's   have more government control let's have   more government in position let's trust   Washington and not the states and it's   failed today we have a president who is   facing the same question how do we make   sure that people with pre-existing   conditions the most vulnerable among us   are protected how do we get premiums to   come down for everyone else at the same   time how do we make sure that every   American has a chance in this area and   I'm proud to stand with a president who   has a different answer   a president who trusts the states and   ultimately trust the American people so   this is a big day it's a first step but   it's an important step to make sure we   keep our promise and we care for the   American people and I'm really proud to   be part of that   that's my it's my honor to invite up the   director of CMS the administrator Seema   Verma   thank you and congratulations to the   president the vice president the speaker   and all the Republican leadership and   all the Republicans in the house thank   you for what you did today   you know I've spoken to a lot of moms   across the country like me and they are   so concerned about the rising cost of   health care paying for expensive   premiums and high deductibles having an   insurance card that they can't use   because it's still unaffordable and what   happened here today was an important   step towards addressing that problem so   thank you and for the Medicaid program   I've worked in the Medicaid program for   over 20 years the Medicaid program is   our age our blind pregnant moms kids   disabled and the poor these are people   that have no other place to go   but the Medicaid program and the status   quo in the Medicaid program is not   acceptable we can do better and the big   step that was taken today is a very   important stride towards making that   program work better towards giving   governor's the flexibility to design   programs that are innovative and   actually improve health outcomes I'm so   excited about this big step forward and   I think it's a great day for our country   so thank you for everybody that was   involved in this it is really a   remarkable day and it's a day of great   victory not for politics or Washington   DC but for the American people mr.   president you have you understand and   appreciate the importance of teams and   teamwork this is a remarkable team that   is assembled here that is trying to   address one of the real conundrums and   challenges that this nation has that is   how to make certain that we are able to   provide the kind of quality care for   every single American but great teams   don't just come together they need great   leaders and so I want to thank you from   the bottom of my heart for the privilege   of being on your team and thank the vice   president in you for what you've   to date to make certain discretion and   we've gotten to this point right now   because the men and women behind us have   acted upon principle and it's the   principle that patients and families and   doctors ought to be making medical   decisions and not Washington DC it's the   principle that our health care system   ought to be accessible for everybody and   affordable for everybody and of the   highest quality and empower patients   through transparency and accountability   and choices that's the kind of principle   that these men and women act upon and I   know that's the kind of principle that   the Senate will bring to the table as   they move forward and deal with this   piece of legislation and I can't wait   for the day mr. president where we're   able to come back to the White House and   we're able to gather with you as you put   that pick up that pen and sign that   piece of paper that will move us in a   direction that will provide for patient   centered health care for every single   American   god bless you so the journey continues   we will get it done we will have great   great health care for everyone in our   nation we have an unbelievable country   an unbelievable country but I want to   thank the men and women behind me I want   to thank at least some of the men and   women in front of me and of course I   even want to thank the media thank you   all very much everybody thank you thank   you very much   you
_ecAgxJP4hs~Trump TV Network~20170420~President Donald Trump Joint Press Conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni~59677.0~4.21839094162~420.0~102.0~   for some residents station accretion and   the Prime Minister of the Republic of   Italy thank you very much   [Music]   prime minister gentiloni welcome great   honor thank you   it's wonderful to have you in our   wonderful people's house known as the   White House and so many great Italian   friends are with us today and we renew   always the deep ties of history and   friendship that linked together the   American and the Italian peoples that   history traces its roots to the timeless   contributions of Italy to civilization   and human progress so true stretching   all the way back to ancient Rome through   the ages your country has been a beacon   of artistic and scientific achievement   that continues today from Venice to   Florence from Verdi to Pavarotti friend   of mine great friend of mine these bonds   of history and culture have only grown   stronger as our two nations have become   close partners dear friends and very   vital allies mr. prime minister I'm   thrilled that you are here today to   discuss how we can make this great   relationship even more productive in the   years to come when the economy Italy is   one of America's largest trading   partners a lot of people don't know that   we both seek a trading relationship that   is balanced reciprocal I love the word   reciprocal because we don't have too   many reciprocal trading partnerships I   will tell you that but we will very soon   and fair benefiting both of our   countries and we can work together to   achieve that outcome and that will   happen Italy is also a key partner in   the fight against terrorism Italy is now   the second largest contributor of troops   to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan   I would also like to thank you   Prime Minister for your leadership on   seeking stabilization in Libya and for   your crucial efforts to deny Isis a   foothold in the Mediterranean you fought   hard we're grateful for your role in the   anti-isis campaign all nations must   condemn this barbaric enemy and support   the effort to achieve its total and   complete destruction also as you know   mr. prime minister we have more than   30000 American servicemembers families   and personnel who are stationed across   your country as we reaffirm our support   for historic institutions we must also   reaffirm the requirement that everyone   must pay their full and fair share for   the cost of Defence together we can   address many pressing challenges   including to the greatly affect both of   our countries those of large-scale   migration and international smuggling   maintaining strong borders is a vital   component of any security policy and a   responsible approach to refugees is one   that seeks the eventual return of   refugees to their home countries so that   they can help to rebuild their own   nations finally I want to say how much I   look forward to visiting Sicily for the   g7 as we seek to foster cooperation not   only in matters of security but also   science commerce health and technology   our two countries have shared interests   and shared values and we can each make   great contributions to the other mr.   prime minister I again want to thank you   for being with us and being our true   friend Italy is a spectacular place I   know it well I love the people of Italy   we have   eighteen million Italians living in the   United States people originally from   Italy and it's a great honor to have   many of them as my friends thank you for   being here thank you thank you for   hosting us here and honored to be here   at the White House today and I'll now   switch to Italian BMO we had a very   fruitful meeting which reflects an   ancient friendship as the president   reminded us with his words this   friendship is also sign of the 18   million Italian Americans who have such   an important role in our country in this   country and this friendship is witnessed   also by the fact that Italy is the   second choice for American students who   study abroad and we're very proud of   this and this confirms the importance   that the United States gives to the   cultural dimension of our country as the   president himself just said this   friendship is based on a common   commitment against terrorism this   commitment see is a commitment in which   we are both very active our country is   very active in Iraq and in Afghanistan   and I think that the stabilization work   will be decisive the stabilization work   of Iraq after the military defeat that   we expected for - we know that this   action against terrorism must take place   within our individual countries in   Europe with the social and cultural   commitment against radicalization by   cooperating with   Islamic communities Italy contributes to   peace and to stability in the   Mediterranean in Syria where I believe   the u.s. choice to react to the use of   chemical weapons by Bashar Assad and   where a negotiated solution is more than   necessary than ever in Libya and we   discussed this in our meeting where we   need to work against the division of the   country in order to stabilize it this is   a very decisive task if we want to   manage the migratory flows without   giving up on our values and our   humanitarian principles and we need to   contrast the horrible traffic of people   and clandestine refugees Italy is   convinced of its strategic commitment in   favour of the transatlantic relationship   we have also spoken about common   commitments in NATO and the goals that   were identified in 2014 and the   commitments on military expenses and the   contribution that each country must make   towards collective security we are proud   of our contribution and finally Italy is   a country of dialogue we are proud   because we succeeded in keeping open the   doors and difficult crises dialogue can   be useful even visibly Russia without   obviously giving up our unity and our   principles and without giving up our   strengths and our values   I also told President Trump that we have   confidence even though this is a   difficult moment and we all know it's   difficult right now we have confidence   in the future of the European Union and   certainly in the importance of the   relationship between the US and Italy   these are the two pillars that the   transatlantic relationship is based on   and great part of peace and freedom in   the world we are going through a   difficult time but I have confidence   that the European Union will continue to   be a positive response to this and   finally we are expecting and I look   forward to the president's visit to the   summit in Taormina and I trust that this   will be the opportunity to show him the   unity of our leaders and the the   principled free economies of a planet   because right now we really do need this   to unity once again   Thank You mr. president thank you very   much thank you appreciate it   take a few questions John Roberts of Fox   please I hope you'll forgive me for   asking you or three-part questions it's   been a while in just the last few   minutes and I believe it was was while   you were meeting with the Prime Minister   there was a shooting in downtown Paris   he's being described as a potential   terrorist attack I wonder if you have   something on that   and further to that to the big trouble   spots that you're dealing with right now   North Korea and Iran do you believe that   the leader of North Korea Kim jong-un is   mentally unstable is that one of the   reasons why you're so concerned about   these latest developments is he a man   who can be reasoned with and on Iran do   you have reason to suspect that they are   cheating on the jcpoa and to mr. prime   minister you talked just a moment ago   but you can it your commitment to NATO   president Trump would like to see all   NATO members contribute two percent of   their GDP to NATO your contribution is   slightly less than 1% will you commit to   committing 2 percent of your GDP to the   alliance going forward thank you well   first of all I love the question you   asked the Prime Minister I look forward   to his answer because I'm going to be   asking them that same question very soon   well first of all our condolences from   our country to the people of France   again it's happening it seems I just saw   it as I was walking in so that's a   terrible thing and it's a very very   terrible thing that's going on in the   world today but it looks like another   terrorist attack and what can you say   just never ends we have to be strong and   we have to be vigilant and I've been   saying it for a long time as far as   North Korea is concerned we are in very   good shape we're building our military   rapidly a lot of things have happened   over the last short period of time I've   been here for approximately 91 days   we're doing a lot of work we're in very   good position we're going to see what   happens   I can't ask your answer your question on   stability I hope the answer is a   positive one not a negative one but   hopefully that will be something that   gets taken care of I have great respect   for the president of China as you know   we had a great summit in Florida and   Palm Beach and got to know each other   and I think like each other I can say   from my standpoint I liked him very much   I respect him very much   and I think he's working very hard I can   say that all of the pundits out there   saying they never have seen China work   like they're working right now many coal   ships have said back many other things   have happened some very unusual moves   have been made over the last two or   three hours and I really have confidence   that the president will try very hard we   don't know whether or not they're able   to do that but I have absolute   confidence that he will be trying very   very hard and one of the reasons that   we're talking about trade deals and   we're talking about all of the different   things but we're slowing up a little bit   I actually told them I said you'll make   a much better deal on trade   if you get rid of this menace or do   something about the Menace of North   Korea because that's what it is it's a   menace right now so we'll see what   happens as far as Iran is concerned I   think they are doing a tremendous   disservice to an agreement that was   signed it was a terrible agreement it   shouldn't have been signed it shouldn't   have been negotiated the way it was   negotiated I'm all for agreements but   that was a bad one as bad as I've ever   seen negotiated they are not living up   to the spirit of the agreement I can   tell you that and we're analyzing it   very very carefully and we'll have   something to say about it in the not too   distant future but Iran has not lived up   to the spirit of the agreement   and they have to do that they have to do   that so we will see what happens thank   you very much thank you the president a   pretty much first of all allow me to   join president Trump's words for what   happened in Paris these are words of   condolences and closeness to the French   people and this is a very delicate   delicate period for them there's just   three days before the election as far as   the question is concerned the commitment   has been made it was made during the   NATO summit and we are used to   respecting our commitments we know that   this will be a gradual process it has   already begun and we know that Italy has   certain limitations when it comes to its   budget it despite these limitations our   commitment for common defense is very   clear   and as I said earlier I'm very proud not   only of the progress made by in our   financial commitment but also proud of   the contribution that we give to the   security of the Alliance in so many   areas of the world but we talked about   Iraq and Afghanistan but we could also   talk about the Baltic Sea or the Balkans   and in all of these areas you will see   the presence of Italian forces within   the Alliance and we are proud of that   Jonathan can you ok Sky Italia prema pal   first for you president gentiloni I   wanted to ask you we saw from the su   administration a new type of policy on   international scene very different from   what we had in the past and one of the   last important operations which was   carried out by President Trump was in   Syria with the bombing of following the   use of chemical weapons by the Assad   regime I wanted to ask you this Italy   think or conceive a possibility to take   action and more acting and more action   in Syria and since my colleague from Fox   News did so high he gonna take as well   the possibility to ask you two questions   first of all about European Union you   said in the past the brexit was a great   thing and that you think that all the   country will follow so you know that   Italy is an important player and   supporter of European integration do you   believe that actually a strong Europe is   important from for the United States   also looking forward at a French   election and then the second question is   that you said that you're looking   forward to come to Italy for the g7 and   I wanted to know if you're also looking   forward if it's going to be possible to   meet Pope Francis during your Italian   trip think   uh Syria Syria we immediately assess the   operation that was ordered by President   Trump and decided that this is a   motivated response to the use of   chemical weapons we added that it's up   to everyone to consider negotiation as   the road through which we hopefully can   put an end to this infinite dramatic war   and come to peace Italy is not directly   involved in the operations and military   operations in Syria other than marginal   aspects but it's not our plan to change   this attitude yes   as strong Europe is very very important   to me as president of the United States   and it's also in my opinion in my very   strong opinion important for the United   States we want to see it   we will help it be strong and it's very   much to everybody's advantage and I look   very much forward to meeting the Pope   [Music]   fabien of the hill fabian yes   Thank You mr. president some people on   Capitol Hill believe you can get one of   two things next week a vote on health   care or a vote on a government funding   bill so my question is which one is more   important to you to have a vote on   health care or a vote on a bill to keep   the government open and mr. prime   minister I want to get your thoughts on   a referendum in Turkey that occurred   last week you spoke about democratic   values in the European continent so are   you concerned with the results of the   Turkish referendum is that something   that you discussed with President Trump   okay I want to get both are you shocked   to hear that and we're doing very well   in health care we'll see what happens   but this is a great bill there's a great   plan and this will be great health care   it's evolving you know there was never a   give up the press sort of reported there   was like a give up there's no give up we   started remember it took Obamacare 17   months I've really been negotiating this   for two months maybe even less than that   because we had a 30-day period where we   did lots of other things the first 30   days but this has really been 2 months   and this is a continuation and the plan   gets better and better and better and   it's gotten really really good and a lot   of people are liking it a lot we have a   good chance of getting it soon I'd like   to say next week but it will be I   believe we will get it and whether it's   next week or shortly thereafter as far   as keeping the government open I think   we want to keep the government open   don't you agree so yeah I think we'll   get both thank you   yeah the turkish referendum is a fact   that we must take note of leaving aside   and the debates that can take place   about how the vote took place but I   believe that the European leadership   have taken note of the vote the   consequences will depend a great deal on   how the Turkish government and president   erred one especially will take into   account almost half of the populations   expression of a different opinion there   will there be an inclusive approach or   will there be a confrontation in this   part of Turkey this will be very   important for us in the European Union   the other thing that's going to be very   important is to is the respect of the   certain fundamental principles we are   members of the Atlantic Alliance Italy   in Turkey and Italy contributes to   Turkey's defense with its own military   assets we believe that among our   countries there should be a cooperation   yeah and hopefully and we trust that   this cooperation will have among its   consequences the solution of the case   concerning the journalist blogger who's   detained who's been detained over the   last few days in Turkey   John Ruffolo Italian ray Etheridge a   president Gentilly owner you have   focused a lot on the leadership Italian   leadership and American leadership in   order to stabilize Libya what do you   expect exactly from Washington and   especially I'm asking you what is   necessary in this process in this   relationship of cooperation with Russia   zentrum do you see a role for your   administration in helping stabilizing   Libya and do you agree that the   stabilizing Libya means combating   terrorism and the ISIS you like to go my   America has played a very key role first   of all to prevent the consolidation of   an important basis for terrorism while -   was undergoing defeats in Iraq and Syria   there were operations that were   sustained by the u.s. against - in the   city of Sirte which were successful   now the commitment must be political and   therefore in the cooperation between US   and Italy and other key partners in the   region the goal is to broaden the cases   of the consensus for the Tripoli   government which is recognized by the   international community but which must   be able to count on a broader consensus   I believe that one clear goal goal   should be this we need the region and we   need countries like Egypt in Tunisia   that are close to Libya we need a stable   and unified Libya a divided and country   and in conflict would be would make   civility worse   the USS job is the u.s. role sorry and   this is very critical do not see a role   in Libya I think the United States has   right now enough roles we're in a role   everywhere so I do not see that I do see   a role in getting rid of Isis we're   being very effective in that regard we   are doing a job with respect to Isis   that it has not been done anywhere near   the numbers that we're producing right   now it's a it's a very effective force   we have we have no choice it's a   horrible thing to say but we have no   choice and we are effectively ridding   the world of Isis I see that as a   primary role and that's what we're going   to do whether it's in Iraq or in Libya   or anywhere else and that role will come   to an end at a certain point and we'll   be able to go back home and rebuild our   country which is what I want to do thank   you all very much I appreciate it thank   you   you   we're grateful for so many great attack   honey as in person brothers you know mr.

United   States   thank you thank you very much   thank you thank you very much ladies and   gentlemen when Justice Scalia passed   away suddenly less februari I made a   promise to the American people if I were   elected president I would find the very   best judge in the country for the   Supreme Court I promised to select   someone who respects our laws and is   representative of our Constitution and   who loves our Constitution and someone   who interpret them as written this may   be the most transparent judicial   selection process in history months ago   as a candidate I publicly presented a   list of brilliant and accomplished   people to the American electorate and   pledged to make my choice from among   that list millions of voters said this   was the single most important issue to   them when they voted for me for   president I am a man of my word I will   do as I say something that the American   people have been asking for from   Washington for a very very long time   today   thank you today I am keeping another   promise to the American people by   nominating judge neil Gorsuch of the   United States Supreme Court to be of the   United States Supreme Court and I would   like to ask judge Gorsuch and his   wonderful wife Louise to please step   forward please Louise judge here they   come here they come   so was that a surprise was it   I have always felt that after the   defense of our nation the most important   decision a president of the United   States can make is the appointment of a   Supreme Court justice depending on their   age a justice can be active for 50 years   and his or her decisions can last a   century or more and can often be   permanent I took the task of this   nomination very seriously I have   selected an individual whose qualities   define really and I mean closely to find   what we're looking for judge Gorsuch has   outstanding legal skills a brilliant   mind tremendous discipline and has   earned bipartisan support when he was   nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of   Appeals he was confirmed by the Senate   unanimously also that's unanimous can   you believe that nowadays with what's   going on   does that happen anymore does it happen   I think it's going to happen maybe again   also with us tonight is Maureen Scalia a   woman loved by her husband and deeply   respected by all I am so happy she is   with us where is one piece there's a   fastening   thank you mom   she is really the ultimate   representative of the late great Justice   Antonin Scalia whose image and genius   was in my mind throughout the   decision-making process not only are we   looking at the writings of the nominee   and I studied them closely but he is   said to be among the finest and most   brilliant oftentimes the writings of any   judge for a long long time and his   academic credentials something very   important to me and that education has   always been a priority are as good as I   have ever seen he received his   undergraduate degree from Columbia with   honors he then received his law degree   from Harvard also with honors where he   was a Truman scholar after Harvard he   received his doctorate at Oxford where   he attended as a Marshall scholar one of   the top academic honors anywhere in the   world after law school he clerked on the   Supreme Court for both justices Byron   white and Anthony Kennedy it is an   extraordinary resume as good as it gets   judge coursers was born and raised in   Colorado and was taught the value of   Independence hard work in public service   while in law school he demonstrated a   commitment to helping the less fortunate   he worked in both Harvard prison legal   assistance projects and Harvard   defenders program brilliance being   assured I studied every aspect of his   life he could have had any job at any   law firm for any amount of money but   what he wanted to do with his career was   to be a judge to right decisions and to   make an impact by upholding our laws in   our Constitution the qualifications of   Judge Gorsuch are beyond dispute he is   the man of our country and a man who our   country really needs and needs badly to   ensure the rule of law   and the rule of Justice I would like to   thank Senate leadership I only hope that   both Democrats and Republicans can come   together for once for the good of the   country congratulations to you and your   family may god bless you may God bless   our glorious nation judge Gorsuch the   podium sir is yours   Thank You mr. president thank you very   much mr. president mr. vice president   you and your team have shown me great   courtesy in this process and even   trusted me with a most solemn assignment   standing here in a house of history and   acutely aware of my own imperfections I   pledge that if I'm confirmed I will do   all my powers permit to be a faithful   servant of the Constitution laws of this   great country for the last decade I've   worked as a federal judge in a court   that spans six western states serving   about twenty percent of the continental   United States and about 18 million   people the men and women I've worked   with at every level in our circuit are   an inspiration to me I've watched them   fearlessly tending to the rule of law   enforcing the promises of our   Constitution and living out daily their   judicial owes to administer justice   equally to rich and poor alike following   the law as they find it and without   respect to their personal political   beliefs I think of them tonight of   course the Supreme Court's work is vital   not just to a region of the country but   to the whole vital to the protection of   the people's liberties under law and the   continuity of our Constitution the   greatest charter of human Liberty the   world has ever known the towering judges   that have served in this particular seat   of the Supreme Court including N and   Scalia and Robert Jackson are much in my   mind at this moment Justice Scalia was a   lion of the law agree or disagree with   him all of his colleagues on the bench   shares his wisdom and his humor and like   them I miss him   I began my legal career working for   Byron white the last caller Aden to   serve on the Supreme Court and the only   justice to lead the NFL in rushing he   was one of the smartest and most   courageous men I've ever known when   justice white retired he gave me the   chance to work for Justice Kennedy as   well Justice Kennedy was incredibly   welcoming and gracious and like justice   white he taught me so much I am forever   grateful and if you've ever met Judge   David sentelle you'll know just how   lucky I was to land a clerkship with him   right out of school thank you these   judges brought me up in the law truly I   would not be here without them today is   as much their day as it is mine in the   balance of my professional life I've had   the privilege of working as a practicing   lawyer and teacher I've enjoyed   wonderful colleagues whose support means   so much to me at this moment as it has   year in and year out practicing and the   trial work trenches of the law I saw to   that when we judges done our robes it   doesn't make us any smarter but it does   serve as a reminder of what's expected   us impartiality and independence   collegiality and courage as this process   now moves to the Senate I look forward   was speaking with members from both   sides of the aisle to answering their   questions and to hearing their concerns   I consider the United States Senate the   greatest deliberative body in the world   and I respect the important role the   Constitution affords in the confirmation   of our judges I respect to the fact that   in our legal order it is for Congress   and not the courts to write new laws it   is a role judges to apply not alter the   work of the people's representatives a   judge who likes every outcome he reaches   is very likely a bad judge stretching   for results he prefers rather than those   the law demands I am so thankful tonight   for my family my friends and my faith   these are the things that keep me   grounded at life speaks and then sustain   me in its valleys to Louise my   incredible wife and companion of 20   years my cherished daughters who are   watching on TV and all my family and   friends I cannot thank you enough for   your love and for your prayers I could   not attempt this without you mr.   president I am honored and I am humbled   thank you very

John's Gospel   reread the light shines in the darkness   that did not overcome it   let us pray good and gracious God you   have revealed your glory a light to all   nations grant us to persevere in works   of your mercy conduct ourselves always   in the way of salvation always free to   walk in your light father of all   creation   you made us in your image and set us   over the works of your hands once you   chose a people and gave them a destiny   and when you brought them out of bondage   to freedom they carried with them the   promise that all people would be blessed   and all would be free it happened to our   fathers who came to this land into a   place of promise and hope it happens to   us still in our time as you lead all   people to the Blessed vision of peace   walking in the freedom of your light   just as we have been called out of   darkness into Christ's marvelous light   let us turn to him in humble but fervent   petition seeking the grace to root out   from our hearts all traces of anything   that holds us back from walking in the   full freedom of the children of God   walking together arm and arm walking   together in the fullness of peace in the   fullness of freedom mindful of those who   do not experience the same freedom we do   God a loving creator from your Provident   hand we have received our right to life   liberty and the pursuit of happiness   you have called us as your people and   given us the right and the duty to   worship you in spirit and in truth we   ask you now on this National Day of   Prayer bless us bless us in our   vigilance for the gift of religious   liberty give us the strength of mind and   heart to always stand for our freedoms   the freedoms of people everywhere in the   world whenever they are threatened and   give us courage to make our voices heard   on behalf of all of those people today   who suffer persecution simply because of   their faith and make us always voices in   defense of the freedom of conscience of   all people we ask you now father father   of light wisdom justice to whom   authority is rightly administered laws   are enacted and judgments decreed assist   with your holy spirit of counsel and   fortitude the president of the United   States Donald Trump that his   administration may be conducted in   righteousness be eminently useful to   your people over whom he presides by   encouraging due respect for virtue and   morality and by a faithful execution of   the laws of mercy and justice grant all   of this we pray Heavenly Father that for   our sake for the sake of our children   and their children and all who come   after us that this great land may always   be one nation under God indivisible with   liberty and justice for all and this we   pray in the name of Christ our Lord and   Savior amen   eternal God the God of our ancestors   Abraham Isaac and Jacob bless our   president Donald Trump on vice president   pence and the members of the cabinet and   all the men and women and children of   this great country of ours on this   National Day of Prayer let us take note   of the first exchange between man and   God recorded in Genesis and they heard   the sound of the Almighty manifesting   itself in the garden and God called out   to Adam where are you and Adam replied I   heard the sound in the garden and I was   afraid yes says the psalmist there is   much to be afraid because the heavens   belong to God but the earth and   responsibility for what happens here   belongs to man reminding us that men and   women created in the image of God did   not arrived on this planet as   hitchhikers with no commitment to a past   and no stake in a future imploring us   never the treat the law as our enemy and   immorality as a friend   shield us from those who worship   self-interest as their deity while   regarding communal responsibilities as a   burden while everyone has the right to   own his dreams   no one's dreams should include a license   to hate teacher so Heavenly Father the   truth expressed in the Torah that tall   is he   who still bent bends down to the meek   and that a man too big to respect his   past is a man too small to inherit the   future that every man created in the   image of God should know that for every   achievement there is a price for every   goal there is an opponent for every   triumph a sacrifice but that the cause   of freedom and human dignity renders   defenseless the opponent small the price   and worthy of every human being   sacrifice amen now it is my privilege to   introduce to you one of our nation's   most committed advocates for religious   freedom and a longtime friend to many of   us here today the Vice President of the   United States   [Applause]   good morning it is the

hire into all our   distinguished guests the president I are   honored by your presence and grateful   for your prayers from the founding of   this nation Americans have claimed that   ancient promised that if his people who   are called by his name will humble   themselves and pray and seek his face   that he will hear from heaven and heal   their land in 1775 the Second   Continental Congress established a day   of fasting in prayer   President Abraham Lincoln's similarly   urged Americans to pray so that in his   words the United cry of the nation will   be heard on high and answered with   blessing in 1952 President Harry Truman   and the Congress formally established   this National Day of Prayer as a time   set aside each year for the American   people to turn to God in prayer and   meditation every president has issued a   proclamation in honor of this day ever   since but not every president has done   so in the Rose Garden at the White House   today our president will continue that   great tradition to proclaim the   importance of prayer to the American   people and to reaffirm the vital role   that institutions and people of faith   play in our national life our president   is a believer he loves his family and he   loves this country with an unshakable   faith in God and the American people so   with gratitude for that faith and for   the

leaders from three   very different faith traditions come   together to lift up our nation in prayer   and it's great to do it at the White   House isn't it isn't that great   because not only are we a nation of   faith but we're a nation of Tolerance as   we look at the violence around the world   and believe me it's violent I get to see   it perhaps better than anybody we   realize how truly blessed we are to live   in a nation that honors the freedom of   worship today my administration is   leading by example as we take historic   steps to protect religious liberty in   the United States of America we will not   allow people of faith to be targeted   bullied or silenced anymore and we will   never ever stand for religious   discrimination never ever tolerance is   the cornerstone of peace and that is why   I am proud to make a major and historic   announcement this morning and to share   with you that my first foreign trip as   president of the United States will be   to Saudi Arabia then Israel and then to   a place that my Cardinals love very much   Rome   [Applause]   these visits will take place ahead of   the NATO g7 meetings and we'll begin   with a truly historic gathering in Saudi   Arabia with leaders from all across the   Muslim world   Saudi Arabia is the custodian of the two   holy asite sin Islam and it is there   that we will begin to construct a new   foundation of cooperation and support   with our Muslim allies to combat   extremism terrorism and violence and to   embrace a more just and hopeful future   for young Muslims in their countries our   task is not to dictate to others how to   live but to build a coalition of friends   and partners who share the goal of   fighting terrorism and bringing safety   opportunity and stability to the war   ravaged Middle East we all pray that we   can make a difference we pray for peace   just over 150 years ago President   Lincoln called for a National Day of   Prayer today after he feared that we   were becoming a nation too proud to pray   to the God that made us today we recall   President Lincoln's words as we sign a   proclamation designating today as   National Day of Prayer that's what we   want a National Day of Prayer and it's   so great to be doing it in the Rose   Garden how beautiful is that   it was looking like you'd never get here   folks but you got here thank you thank   [Applause]   you thank you very much so true and we   remember this eternal truth freedom is   not a gift from government freedom is a   gift from God it was Thomas Jefferson   who said the God who gave us life gave   us Liberty our founding fathers believed   that religious liberty was so   fundamental that they enshrined it in   the very first amendment of our great   and beloved constitution yet for too   long the federal government has used the   power of the state as a weapon against   people of faith bullying and even   punishing Americans for following their   religious beliefs that's been happening   that is why I am signing today an   executive order to defend the freedom of   religion and speech in America the   freedoms that we've wanted the freedoms   that you fought for so long and we are   doing it in just a little while right   over here   [Applause]   thank you all thank you   no Americans should be forced to choose   between the dictates of the federal   government and the tenants of their   faith as I campaigned across the country   faith leaders explained that they were   prevented from speaking their minds   because of a 1954 rule known as the   Johnson amendment I spoke about it a lot   under this rule if a pastor priest or   imam speaks about issues of public or   political importance they are threatened   with the loss of their tax-exempt status   a crippling financial punishment very   very unfair but no longer I promised to   take action if I want I didn't win I   gave you no promise that's for sure if I   didn't win I guess I'd be gone right I'd   be out enjoying my life I think but I   wouldn't be helping you with the Johnson   amendment and to this end this financial   threat against the faith community is   over   in just a few moments I will be signing   an executive order to follow through on   that pledge and to prevent the Johnson   amendment from interfering with your   First Amendment rights and your the   people I want to listen to other people   are allowed to tell me and everybody   what to do I want to hear it from you   and so do a lot of other people so   you're now in a position where you can   say what you want to say and I know   you'll only say good and you'll say   what's in your heart and that's what we   want from you you are great great people   you are great great people thank you   thank you this executive order directs   the IRS not to unfairly target churches   and religious organizations for   political speech no one should be   censoring sermons or targeting pastors   [Applause]   and I know one thing it never stopped   dr. ben Carson he said the heck with the   Johnson amendment right Ben I've been   with Ben and he did what he wanted to do   but not everybody is going to do that   Ben you know that right in America we do   not fear people speaking freely from the   pulpit we embrace it   America has a rich tradition of social   change beginning in our pews and our   pulpits perhaps there is no greater   example than the historic role of the   african-american church as the agent for   social progress sparing our nation to   greater justice and equality   we must never infringe on the noble   tradition of change from the church and   progress from the Pew   [Applause]   thank you thank you under my   administration free speech does not end   at the steps of a Cathedral or a   synagogue or any other house of worship   we are giving our churches their voices   back we are giving them back in the   highest form with this executive order   we also make clear that the federal   government will never ever penalize any   person for their protected religious   beliefs that is why I am today   directing the Department of Justice to   develop new rules to ensure these   religious protections are afforded to   all Americans there are more than 50   religious Americans and groups sued the   previous and you've seen that 50 sued   the previous administration for   violating their religious freedom the   abuses were widespread the abuses were   all over as just one example people were   forbidden from giving or receiving   religious items at a military hospital   where our brave service members were   being treated and when they wanted those   religious items these were great great   people these are great soldiers they   wanted those items they were precluded   from getting them and we know all too   well the attacks against the Little   Sisters of the Poor   [Applause]   incredible nuns who care for the sick   the elderly and they've forgotten where   are they by the way where are they could   you stand sisters Stan   come on up here sister come on up right   [Applause]   congratulations they sort of just won a   lawsuit that was pretty good that's a   good way of doing it huh well I want you   to know that your long ordeal will soon   be over okay   it's been a long hard ordeal we've all   been watching some of you have been very   much involved a lot of us have been   watching the news for years and five   years yet good lawyers where are your   lawyers stand up come on stand up   good job do you mind if I use your   lawyers for very much I could use some   good lawyers too good job great job with   this executive order we are ending the   attacks on your religious liberty and we   are proudly reaffirming america's   leadership role as a nation that   protects religious freedom for everyone   over 60 years ago the IRS one after one   of the greatest leaders in history   Reverend Martin Luther King jr. it is a   sobering reminder of the need for   vigilance the words of Reverend King and   other religious leaders have awakened   the conscience of millions and millions   of Americans and inspired us to act in   the name of peace justice freedom and   charity   every president must work to protect and   we have to do this we have no choice to   do this we have absolutely no choice to   protect these hard-fought games they   have been hard-fought they have been   fought for so many years for so many   decades for so many centuries and this   is a very special day perhaps for that   reason and that's why we're here today   to defend the rights of all Americans to   honor our great Constitution and to   protect the sacred liberties given to us   not by any earthly power but by our   Creator in heaven I'd like to thank all   of you great great religious leaders for   being with us today we have some of our   political leaders you can have them they   know they know and today is a very big   day we have a big vote coming up in a   little while and I thought it was very   appropriate that it turned out to be you   folks and then I have to deal with those   politicians but they're good I will tell   you they're good they work very hard and   hopefully we're going to have a   wonderful day and a wonderful vote and   we're going to take care of a lot of   people great great people from this   country with their health care their   health care needs and we hope to be able   to do that and we have all fought very   hard to be able to do that so I want to   say to everybody in attendance and   everybody in our country and everybody   in the world god bless you and God bless   america thank you all very much thank   you thank you   [Applause]   okay   National Day of Prayer we like that   Proclamation   [Applause]   it's owner of dr. Martin Luther King   [Applause]   this is promoting and the promotion of   free speech and religious liberty that's   a big one that's as big as it gets right   where's   right behind you sir what she's worth so   far two years is what something thank   you very much everybody   fantastic to have you we really   appreciate very special these are two   very very special executive orders and   an honor to have everybody here and   thank you all so thank you   [Applause]   jab you   Oh   you   you

Liberty to the Greek   people it commemorates the fight for the   Greek Independence that began on March   25th 1821 after nearly 400 years of   outside rule the Greeks long to regain   their sovereignty this love of freedom   and democracy has formed a lasting bond   between our two countries it is a bond   that has its origins in ancient Greece   the birthplace of democracy American   President James Monroe and the great   American Statesman Daniel Webster both   supported Greece's struggle for   independence and it was a tough tough   struggle you know that then   representative Webster honored the role   of grease in forming civilization and   said that we like the rest of mankind   are greatly her debtors in years to come   we don't know what will be required to   defend our freedom but we do know that   it will demand great great courage   courage from all of us and we will show   it and I have no doubt about that   glowing inspiration from our history and   those who come before we will rise to   any occasion we have a country that as   you know has certain difficulties has   certain problems we will solve those   problems and we will quickly solve those   difficulties just watch I want to thank   you all for coming to the White House   today we celebrate greek history and we   applaud the tremendous contributions of   your people to our beloved country

 years ago we have the distinct honor and   special privilege to be once again at   the White House on the occasion of the   celebration of the Greek Independence   Day we are deeply grateful as the Greek   Orthodox American community for such a   recognition and for your kindness mr.   president to sign the proclamation that   pays tribute to the historic 1821 greek   revolution a revolution led to the   liberation of greece after four   centuries of bitter conditions under the   very painful occupation and rule of the   ottoman empire America has been   connected to Greece in a special way   even before the revolution of 1821 and   the creation of Greece as an independent   state allow me to share with you an   example of how far back this strong bond   extends most people when asked the   question what was America's first war on   foreign soul have no answer the answer   is the Barbary Wars of 1805 when Thomas   Jefferson was president at the time   president Jefferson sent special envoy   General William eaten on a secret   mission to stop the Barbary pirates   were demanding tribute from ships   traveling the north part of Africa close   to contemporary Libya at two p.m. on   April 27 1805 general asian leading an   attack force of seven United States   Marines and 26 Greek recruits as well as   24 European mercenaries advance   victoriously on the city of Tripoli   Libya in this battle Greeks who signed   on an oath to protect and defend the   United States of America led by Captain   konstantinos Lucas fought side by side   with the American marines and many fell   heroically on the battlefield then we   should remember the that Greece with the   United States fought on the side of   democracy and against tyranny in two big   world wars and then in the Korean War   where the soldiers of the Greek Sparta   battalion were among the many Greek and   Greek Americans who sacrificed their   lives and received us congressional   citations more recently together we   suffered unspeakable tragedies   especially in the terrorist attack on   September 11 2001 a victim of which was   also our semi colleges in Ground Zero   yet determined to overcome any adversity   and proving that the spirit of freedom   is victorious over evil we are   rebuilding together and with the help of   God the Almighty God   in the world trade center part of which   raised from the ashes is the new st.   nicholas greek orthodox church and   national shrine a symbol of hope and   victory against evil and barbarism   through history both our nation's have   exercised their uncompromised right to   break the yoke of tyranny and to recover   the priceless gift of self-governance   and independence all the more this has   been a central focus in defense and in   protection and promotion of the supreme   value of the religious freedom during   our very solid meetings in this White   House we repeatedly have indicated   painfully how the ideas of Independence   and religious freedom unfortunately   apply to special situations related to   our clerical battle case to Cyprus and   to film today however allow me mr.   president vice president to offer in   addition strongly for the very country   where the revolution of 1821 occurred   Greece is this country a faithful and   compromising and dedicate ally of the   grad stays who remains valiant despite   demanding and life sacrificing   conditions in numerous wars in which the   United States had been involved yet   Greece this very special ally of the   United States has been at least for the   plus five to six years   in a continuing financial ordeal and   affliction on this occasion the people   of Greece and I am speaking from   personal experience remember very well   the decisive impact on Europe and   especially Greece of both the Marshall   Plan and the Truman Doctrine we know and   are deeply grateful to the garage States   of America which saved a devastated   Europe after the Second World War   the contribution of America was truly   monumental helping to restore   financially a war-ravaged Europe today   compared to the gigantic assistance   needed for Europe after World War Two a   significantly less assistance is needed   for Greece to recuperate financially and   function again as a dynamic state by   doing so by assisting the possibility   will be given to Greece to resume and   continue a vital role as a faithful Ally   and a nation that produce waves of   succeeding cultures and civilizations   for 6000 years on this day of on this   day of Greek Independence we fervently   pray that God put an end to the ordeal   of Greece the mother of democracy   culture philosophy science and even a   model of philanthropy towards the   hundreds of thousands of refugees we   asked for peace in our wounded world we   play intensely for the grated States of   America they staunch defender of freedom   and justice for all for the noble first   family the President and the Vice   President of the United States and for   all the people who are in need for   divine and human assistance we pray and   we believe we pray and we hope we pray   and we are in grateful anticipation of   your positive   initiative thank you   [Applause]   the defendants a great honor thank you   very much   [Applause]

constant source of strength   what I hear most often as I travel the   country or five words that never ever   fail to touch my heart that's I am   praying for you I hear it so often I am   praying for you mr. president   no one has inspired me more my travels   than the families of the United States   military men and women who have put   their lives on the line every day for   their country and their countrymen I   just came back yesterday from Dover Air   Force Base to join the family of Chief   William ryan owens as america's fallen   hero was returned home very very sad but   very very beautiful very very beautiful   his family was their incredible family   loved him so much so devastated he was   so devastated but the ceremony was   amazing he died in defense of our nation   he gave His life in defense of our   people our debt to him and our debt to   his family is eternal and everlasting   greater love hath no man than this that   a man lay down his life for his friends   we will never forget the men and women   who wear the uniform believe me   ok   from generation to generation their   vigilance has kept our Liberty alive our   freedom is one by their sacrifice and   our security has been earned with their   sweat and blood and tears God has   blessed this land to give us such   incredible heroes and Patriots they are   very very special and we are going to   take care of them our soldiers   understand that what matters is not   party or ideology or creed but the bonds   of loyalty that link us all together as   one America is a nation of believers in   towns all across our land it's plain to   see what we easily forget so easily we   forget this that the quality of our   lives is not defined by our material   success but by our spiritual success I   will tell you that and I tell you that   from somebody that has had material   success and knows tremendous numbers of   people with great material success the   most material success many of those   people are very very miserable unhappy   people and I know a lot of people   without that but they have great   families they have great faith they   don't have money at least not nearly to   the extent and they're happy those to me   are the successful people I have to tell   you   I was blessed to be raised in a church   home my mother and father taught me that   to whom much is given much is expected I   was sworn in on the very Bible from   which my mother would teach us as young   children and that faith lives on in my   heart every single day the people in   this room come from many many   backgrounds you represent so many   religions and so many views but we are   all united by our faith in our Creator   and our firm knowledge that we are all   equal in his eyes we are not just flesh   and bone and blood we are human beings   with Souls our republic was formed on   the basis that freedom is not a gift   from government but that freedom is a   gift from God   it was the great Thomas Jefferson who   said the God who gave us life gave us   Liberty Jefferson asked can the   liberties of a nation be secure when we   have removed a conviction that these   liberties are the gift of God among   those freedoms is the right to worship   according to our own beliefs that is why   I will get rid of and totally destroy   the Johnson Amendment and allow our   representatives of faith to speak freely   and without fear of retribution I will   do that remember   freedom of religion is a sacred right   but it also right under threat all   around us and the world is under serious   serious threat in so many different ways   and I've never seen it so much and so   openly as since I took the position of   president the world is in trouble but   we're going to straighten it out okay   that's what i do i fix things we're   going to straighten it out believe me   when you hear about the tough phone   calls i'm having don't worry about it   just don't worry about it they're tough   we have to be tough it's time we're   going to be a little tough folks would   take an advantage of by every nation in   the world virtually it's not going to   happen anymore it's not going to happen   anymore we have seen unimaginable   violence carried out in the name of   religion acts of wanton slaughter   against religious minorities Horrors on   a scale that defy description terrorism   is a fundamental threat to religious   freedom it must be stopped and it will   be stopped may not be pretty for a   little while it will be stopped we have   seen   and by the way general as you know James   Mad Dog sunset in this room maddis now   there's a reason they call him mad dog   mattis never lost a battle always wins   him and always wins them fast he's our   new secretary of defense will be working   with Rex he's right now in South Korea   going to Japan go in some other spots   I'll tell you what I've gotten to know   him really well he's the real deal we   have somebody who's the real deal   working for us and that's what we need   so you watch we just watch things will   be different we have seen peace-loving   Muslims brutalized victimized murdered   and oppressed by Isis killers we have   seen threats of extermination against   the Jewish people we have seen a   campaign of Isis and genocide against   Christians were they cut off heads not   since the Middle Ages have we seen that   we haven't seen that the cutting off of   heads now they cut off the heads they   drown people in steel cages haven't seen   this I haven't seen this nobody's seen   this for many many years all nations   have a moral obligation to speak out   against such violence all nations have a   duty to work together to confront it and   to confront it viciously if we have to   so I want to express clearly today to   the American people that my   administration will do everything in its   power to defend and protect religious   liberty in our land America must forever   remain a tolerant society we're all face   or respected and we're all of our   citizens can feel safe and secure we   have to feel safe and secure in recent   days we have begun to take necessary   action to achieve that goal our nation   has   the most generous immigration system in   the world but these are those and there   are those that would exploit that   generosity to undermine the values that   we hold so dear we need security there   are those who would seek to enter our   country for the purpose of spreading   violence or pressing other people based   upon their faith or their lifestyle not   right we will not allow a beachhead of   intolerance to spread in our nation you   look all over the world and you see   what's happening so in the coming days   we will develop a system to help ensure   that those admitted into our country   fully embrace our values of religious   and personal liberty and that they   reject any form of oppression and   discrimination we want people to come   into our nation but we want people to   love us and to love our values not to   hate us and to hate our values we will   be a safe country we will be a free   country and we will be a country where   all citizens can practice their beliefs   without fear of hostility or fear of   violence America will flourish as long   as our Liberty and in particular our   religious liberty is allowed to flourish   America will succeed as long as our most   vulnerable citizens and we have some   that are so vulnerable have a path to   success and America will thrive as long   as we continue to have faith in each   other and faith in God that faith in God   has inspired men and women to sacrifice   for the needy to deploy tours overseas   and to lock arms at home to ensure equal   rights for every man woman and child in   our land it's that faith that sent the   pilgrims across the oceans the pioneers   across the plains and the young people   all across America to chase their dreams   they are chasing their dreams we are   going to bring those dreams back as long   as we have God we are never ever alone   whether it's the soldier on the Night   Watch with a single parent on the night   shift God will always give us solace and   strength and comfort we need to carry on   and to keep carrying on for us here in   Washington we must never ever stop   asking God for the wisdom to serve the   public according to his will that's why   thank you   that's why President Eisenhower and   senator Carlson had the wisdom to gather   together 64 years ago to begin this   truly great tradition but that's not all   they did together let me tell you the   rest of the story just one year later   senator Carlson was among the members of   Congress to send to the President's desk   a joint resolution that added under God   to our Pledge of Allegiance it's a great   thing because that's what we are and   that is what we will always be and that   is what our people want one beautiful   nation under God thank you god bless you   and God bless america thank you very   much thank you thank you   [Applause]   the president we are coming near the end   of his prayer breakfast the presence of   the Divine Spirit in this room with us   resting on each heart and radiating   outwards reinforces for me what   scripture insists is one of our most   basic obligations to love our neighbor   as ourself we are all children of God   each of us created in His image and   though we might have different images as   we look out at each other today it is in   that spirit of prayer and love for all   of us that we have gathered rabbi looks   teen thank you for sharing with us this   morning the words of Solomon from Torah   that we must continue to proclaim   Liberty for all of God's children and to   congressman Vargas and Adam hold thank   you for your prayers for the poor and   for justice and your reminder that we   should pray for those in leadership in   our republic Thank You Bard maillard and   mercy me for sharing about your father   and sharing about how your life has been   transformed through prayer and in song   helping us to imagine what our eyes will   see when his face is before us and when   his glory surrounds us and thank you for   reminding us that God's love can   transform us Thank You chaplain black   for your service and for your spirit and   for reminding us that with prayer all   things are possible from healing our   nation's divisions and our difficult   racial history to making our voices   heard in heaven as long as we pray with   that earnest need you have not just an   appointed position chaplain but an   anointed position   and to my partner and friend senator   Bozeman thank you it's been a wonderful   journey together and mr. president thank   you for joining us this morning and for   keeping this tradition one that really   does matter in which every president has   joined this breakfast as we humble   ourselves and pray for our nation for   wisdom and for hope as I said in the   opening the weekly Senate prayer   breakfasts the house prayer breakfast   the parliamentary prayer breakfast   around the world are opportunities for   us to come together with those who are   our opponents those with whom we fight   and struggle in the daily work of   politics we gather we humble ourselves   and we see God's face I grew up in a   small Church in Delaware and there was a   men's prayer group in that church that   church did bold things it welcomed   refugees it fed the hungry and homeless   but one Sunday morning a visiting pastor   asked if anyone had ever tried to make   real the challenge of Isaiah 61 and   other challenges from our old testament   that said to visit the widow and the   orphan to visit those in prison to feed   the hungry and to welcome the stranger   and he said I'm going to the prison here   in Delaware in Smyrna to visit with   prisoners will anyone come with me this   was a suburban Republican Presbyterian   congregation we did everything decently   and in order and a few men surprised   themselves by finding their arms raised   and then went to this place to visit   with people quite different from   themselves and to feel the spirit moved   them to challenge them to be brothers   with people who had lived very different   lives one of those men became close   friends with a convicted murderer named   Paul one of those men welcomed that man   Paul into his home where he was raising   three young boys and took a great risk   because of the power of that prayer   group   that man is my father it is amazing what   prayer can challenge us to do and so mr.   president we shared a solemn and very   difficult moment yesterday as you came   to my home state of Delaware and we   traveled together along with many   leaders of our military and members of   Congress but as we gathered with the   family of a Navy SEAL ryan owens to   comfort his widow his young children his   parents and his family and as we marched   and assembled and prayed at the very   edge of his flag-draped coffin i could   see the weight of your office upon your   shoulders and so with the same courage   my father had in his prayer group i   might ask if you just come stand with me   and john if you'd stand alongside him   and if you all please would bow your   heads as we pray for a moment as Solomon   did as David did Heavenly Father we ask   that you would give our president your   wisdom that you would open our hearts   and his heart that you would give us a   heart for all your children a heart of   humility and grace amen   and now for a closing moving song Bart   milord and mercy me   [Applause]
dLY4yp2Wp_U~Trump TV Network~20170404~WATCH: President Donald Trump Hosts a CEO Town Hall on the American Business Climate~18676.0~4.58709669113~278.0~32.0~   start with Ivanka so workforce is a   topic that impacts people in various   stages of their education and work life   how will the administration look at this   holistically well I think first and   foremost you have to break it down into   multiple elements so when you think   about the broader concept of Workforce   Development you think about K through 12   and ensuring the kids graduating and   coming out of our school system are   equipped with the skills that are   necessary in the modern workforce and   especially in in STEM fields for example   we're see that the students are not   ready and are not able and are not   prepared either for higher education in   a lot of cases or to enter the workforce   in a meaningful way so so education is   is very core the second area we're   looking at is the role of vocational   education in particular apprenticeships   and we actually just had a very robust   discussion with the Chancellor of   Germany when she was in town just a few   weeks ago because the Germans have   really led the way on this front the   Swiss have done a great job with it more   recently in England we've seen a lot of   focus on apprenticeship training so   really thinking about the role of   vocational education and making sure   that it is incentivized for both the   students to consider it as a not viable   option and partnering with the private   sector to to really ensure that what's   happening the education taking place   whether it's a community college or at   apprenticeship programs matches matches   ultimately their needs so so skill based   education the last thing we're looking   at is workforce retraining so for people   who have been out of the workforce for a   number of years and are looking to   re-enter or people who are currently in   the workforce but they're in a field   where jobs are rapidly being displaced   so how do we take large groups of people   and think about how to retrain them   in areas where their skills will be more   relevant to the workforce of the future   so it's a big topic there's tens of   billions of dollars that are allocated   across over 14 agencies on this topic so   another area similar to what we were   talking about with infrastructure is   really taking a look at all the programs   that are out there consolidating those   programs and working collectively we had   a meeting last week where we had the   Secretary of Education Wilbur we had the   secretary call vanie was a ball of a   knee was there really thinking about how   we can ensure that everyone's working   collectively with these goals in mind   great Thank You secretary Ross are there   ways to incentivize the private sector   to further their investment in workforce   training many of them have taken a   leadership role on this already yes the   big corporations seem to be finding a   pretty good way to do it if you have a   large number of employment needs in   given locations who can partner with   local community college with even some   of the high schools to accomplish the   purpose what's harder is to get the   small business who has very limited   needs to be able to do it so we've been   focusing some on delivery mechanisms and   one of the ones I'm kind of intrigued   with is integrating technology into the   delivery mechanism you have licensing   problems at schools you have all kinds   of things of that sort so I think   combining the human instructor element   with Internet deliberate service in   education is a very important thing   specifically for the small businesses   who are looking at programs whereby they   can both get an assurance of retention   through a kind of loan program to the   students with the idea being they would   gradually forgive those loans as the   student stays on with the employer may   be over a five-year   period and trying to match that with tax   deductible ax t to the corporation but   hopefully not taxable income to the   student as the loans are forgiven and   coupled that perhaps with some loans   from the Small Business Association so   I'll business administration to the   little companies back by the combination   of the company's credit and the loans   that they had made to these students on   some realistic loan to value ratio so   we're trying to get into the   nitty-gritty of the how so that this can   truly be rolled out on a nationwide   basis and help not just big companies   but little ones because the younger   companies tend to be the ones who are   really producing the jobs than or   expanding the most rapidly certainly   going to feel for why secretary Ross's   at the table on Workforce Development   Dina the private sector to continue on   that conversation as we've mentioned so   far they've been the leader so far in   workforce development as we look at   making this an a true initiative of the   administration what role with a private   sector play in that well first of all I   think clearly defining some measurable   goals in each of the initiatives having   spent the last ten years in the private   sector I'm having a little bit of   whiplash coming back to government and   remembering some of the inefficiencies   and some of the difficulties when that   read and Jared and Chris spoke to the   president about taking on the IT   challenge you know the minor thing of   trying to modernize the IT of the US   government the president nailed it by   saying that sounds like a really hard   thing to do that's going to help the   next guy and I think that's often why so   many of these projects haven't been   taken on they require presidential   leadership and capital and a real   commitment to work with the private   sector and I think the private sector   will push us in the right direction   through the American innovation Council   to actually have measurable goals in   each of these initiatives as a leader   McCarthy was laying out when I was   working with Kathy   and Bob's deal and others in New York on   the private sector initiatives we built   we really tried to think about our   company as at the time as a lab of   innovation the private sector can take   riskier capital to build new models   around job creation economic development   whatever they may be and actually have   the rigor of a measurement system to see   how this program worked and what it   achieved but it really is ultimately   only government that can scale programs   in a meaningful way and I do think in   this administration there is an   incredible desire to have a real legacy   around things that the private sector   helped us achieve that we can really   measure in an important way it's been   interesting as we've started to study it   the same principles that are holding   true in countries that have always   favored apprenticeship programs are true   here that it's being driven by the   private sector when our private sector   companies team with local community   college has helped them do the   curriculum put in place internship and   apprenticeship programs at the private   sector wall they're doing the community   college education vocational education   they're achieving terrific results   people are not dropping out there   they're out a pathway to a job and   they're good high wage jobs so this is   something that we as an administration   can one hundred percent get behind and   amplify and that's really I think our   mission agreed on that point it's worth   mentioning the task force that was   formed with the private sector on   exactly this topic so obviously this   will be informed by incredible academics   and and both government agencies and and   people working in in just across the   private sector but but some of the   programs that we've we've examined and   Ginny Romney from IBM is on our task   force and one of the incredible things   she did at IBM was really work with a   series of now over 40 public schools to   ensure and creating an actual curriculum   with those schools the p-tech schools   the first one was in Brooklyn New York   actually and to create a curriculum for   these apprenticeships for these students   going through and then IBM would hire   the students on the other side   and this stemmed and we heard a time and   time again whether it was from andrew   from dow chemical or jenny from IBM so   many large organizations we're looking   to cultivate and really create in this   next generation of graduating students   the kit skills that they need it to   employ so it's really happening already   in a very robust and dynamic way in the   private sector because of the need right   now there are over half a million jobs   that can't be filled because the   students graduating don't have the   skills that are relevant for those   positions so we want to bridge that gap   we want to take these programs and grow   them and in a very real and measurable   way it's a great point and one of the   things we have to do as part of that is   we have to rebrand vocational education   we need to make it something that's   honored as your father has said so often   that a skill needs to be honored and   fortunately we have someone in ivanka   that knows a little bit about branding   you've also been a vocal person about   the need to empower women in the   workforce and in the workplace today is   equal pay day nationally how will this   workforce initiative support your goal   of empowering women in the workplace   well my father wants to create 25   million jobs in this country and women   need to fully participate for that to be   realized and for that goal to be   realized women are starting businesses   at an enormously fast rate we need to   empower them into to fuel that growth   when we think about workforce   development and just one component of it   I was talking about earlier STEM   education while forty-eight percent of   today's workforce are women only   twenty-four percent of people and STEM   fields are female and when you think   about where the jobs of the future   coming from that's a very frightening   statistic and we're actually moving in   the wrong directions over the course of   a little over a decade women's   participation   in science engineering math and   technology has actually slid from just   around 32 to now in the low 20s   depending on which of those disciplines   so it's really important we think about   the introduction of girls in STEM fields   in our school system making sure that   that they're really participating in   these fields because when when we think   about equal pay and and the the   challenge we have to to finally level   the playing field I think this will be a   very important component when we think   about the future to doing just that that   it we talked about in the first answer   this is going to be a holistic approach   and unfortunately unfortunately all   these topics we're talking about to   their big topics they take a sustained   effort in order to effectuate them   properly and you're talking about   workforce well that starts in k-12 right   and and then it leads into a vocational   apprenticeship and then it gets into   retraining as a vodka was saying these   are big projects big initiatives but   that's what this administration wants to   take on let's let's go to the CEOs to   get their input and ideas so I think the   notes over here I just to pick up on the   apprenticeship idea we've tried that and   run a technology company strong yeah no   problem and with Coney it's it's   actually worked pretty well but it did   take a lot of time and this is where the   federal government can help so we formed   dipika 20 our software it built two   courses around us when the kids graduate   and get certified we guarantee them a   job with us and one of our customers   that's working well but finding the   professor who understands that who wants   to do that understand it's okay for   academia to to partner with a commercial   company that took two or three years to   find that person is each University in   the second thing is just a funding there   has to be a computer infrastructure   setup somebody as a trainer professors   curriculum has to be built so it's not   inexpensive and that take another two or   three years and so the idea is great but   just need some way to scale them over   time and encourage you because that's   what happens in India and Manila that's   what they've been doing this for many   years if we could do that here that   shortage of talent that we have in   technology that's the way the address   and and we've seen some of the most   successful examples happening   organically just like you mentioned   where private sector needs ad companies   are being met through community colleges   where they're collaborating locally   creating a curriculum that is mutually   advantageous to the students graduating   and to the companies who who are   prospective employers so so we're we're   studying all those all those different   efforts and looking to figure out how to   scale it I think secretary Ross   mentioned the role of digital which is   enormously important also the role of   creating accreditation programs and   really thinking about how to to create   both standards and certificates across   different industries and the   construction industry in particular has   done quite a good job on this front and   that's why so many of today's apprentice   apprentices that you see are coming up   through that industry so taking some   examples and and bringing that to   manufacturing and bringing that to   technology yeah I'd like to challenge   the people in this audience to come up   with a better way to label vocational we   mentioned breed mentioned about branding   I think it needs rebranding in two   dimensions one is with the young people   themselves because vocational has taken   on a pejorative meaning that i think is   unnecessary but the others with the   parents parents have a revulsion to the   idea that their offspring might actually   work with their hands or not work as if   after college and i think we need to   change both mindsets in order to get   this program to really work for the   young folks ivanka secretary Ross Deena   is a big topic we appreciate the time   thank you so much thank you and I would   encourage everyone in this room to try   and create apprenticeship programs that   their companies because you can all   really move the needle dancer drunk yeah   [Applause]   it's now my great honor to introduce   someone who's actually very very   familiar and has been a leader on all   the issues that we've been talking about   in his 12 years in Congress and in his   four years as the governor of Indiana   Mike Pence led the country in in these   issues being modernizing of government   and workforce development he's also a   man of incredible quality and honor it   is truly one of my great privileges to   get to work with him so please help me   in welcoming the 48th vice president of   the United States mr. Mike Pence   [Applause]   thank you all very much thank you read   and how about another round of applause   for that last panel in banca and Dina   and Wilbur it's a great privilege to be   able to welcome you to the White House   thank you so much I want to thank   everyone involved in the partnership for   New York City Michael Corbitt Stephen   Schwarzman it is a it's an honor to have   the leaders that are gathered in the   room here with us today I know the   president is on his way over and it's my   great privilege this morning to share a   few thoughts in the midst of the sea   important conversation on the topics   that you're covering before I introduce   my friend and the 45th president of the   United States but let me say first and   foremost so the companies represented in   the partnership for New York City are   all American success stories you have   our admiration you have our appreciation   your businesses account for more than 7   million jobs and you add over one   trillion dollars to our economy each and   every year what's more important is the   people behind the numbers and the topics   that you've covered today are all about   creating more jobs and more   opportunities for Americans who are who   are who are anxious to climb the ladder   of success in the organizations that you   represent and in companies all across   this country so first and foremost on   behalf of the president the whole team   that you've heard from this morning and   distinguished members of our cabinet   thank you and thank you for what you do   thank you for your leadership I think as   you will hear this morning in the   dialogue that is about to commence that   America has elected a business man as   president of the United States and he is   committed to being the best friend   business has ever had in the White House   [Music]   we've already we've already seen the   results since literally when the   election was called at I think it was   about four in the morning that morning   wasn't it Ivanka that we were all   together literally we've seen we've seen   renewed energy and dynamism in the   American economy the first two jobs   reports as I'm sure you are aware thanks   in no small part to the leadership   represented in businesses here in the   room today the first two jobs reports   show that under President Trump nearly   500 thousand new jobs have been created   in the first two months of this year   businesses and consumers haven't been   this optimistic in in decades in fact we   just learned from the National   Association of Manufacturers that in   their historic quarterly report 93% of   manufacturers are optimistic about the   future that represented almost a 40   point increase in optimism since the   last report we think we think that is   that is evidence of a vote of confidence   in our new president and in his his   vision and to get this economy moving   again by putting common-sense principles   into practice from the very outset of   this administration the president has   been energetically working to rollback   excessive regulation and red tape   leaders in Congress and I see leader   McCarthy who's with us today have been   producing under what's known as the   Congressional review Act legislation to   roll back onerous regulations that   emerged in the waning days of the Obama   administration and in the coming days   president Trump will be signing even   more bills into law rolling back that   avalanche of red tape the president's   also taken decisive executive action on   expanding American energy the Keystone   pipeline and the Dakota pipeline we are   we continue to work earnestly with   Congress for a new future on health care   reform the president I remain confident   that working with the Congress we will   repeal and replace   Obamacare with healthcare reform that   will work for the American people and   work for the American economy and of   course in the offing before we reach the   end of the year the president is   determined and to roll the sleeves up   work with the Congress and pass the   largest tax reform in a generation   business as I said from those numbers   about optimism business has clearly   gotten the message but today's   conversation is all about learning from   job creators represented in this room   how we can continue to build on the   momentum in this economy particularly   focusing on infrastructure a government   modernization and in workforce I can   tell you that the subject that I came in   at the end up and I know as much a topic   today with Ivanka and with Wilbur having   to do with improving the quality of our   workforce expanding opportunities for   what is known as Career and Technical   Education what we back in Indiana call   vocational education is a real passion   for our new president and we look   forward to partnering with you in ways   that we can continue to encourage   investment and create opportunities for   expanded career and vocational education   so today is all about is all about   really giving you an opportunity to   share your thoughts it's part of an   ongoing conversation this administration   has has commenced since the very first   day the president took office listening   to business leaders listening to every   day Americans about ways that we can   bring about his agenda to make America   great again and to have our economy   growing and expanding in a way that is   consistent with the most powerful   economy in the history of the world I   think the president is in the side   chamber so let me say to all of you the   opportunity you have today is to hear   from a man who I have a chance to sit   with every day what you're going to see   firsthand is what I see each and every   day and that is   that is not only just a businessman made   president but you're going to see a   leader informed focused decisive and   absolutely committed to make America   great again it is my high honor and   distinct privilege to introduce to all   of you my friend the 45th president of   the United States of America President   Donald Trump   thank you Mike   [Music]   good morning Sarah no lo Ivanka I know   you know a few of the people in this   room I do all the killers from New York   I'm looking at all those competitive   those great great talents great builders   I have to give you a heads up that   Ivanka chaired one of the sessions   before this tough act to follow she's   got ya hey vice-president pence listed   some of the amazing accomplishments that   have taken place since your election and   your 75 days in office the stock market   has had almost unprecedented sustained   growth unprecedented confidence for   manufacturing sector and other business   sectors leading the massive private   sector investment and job growth you   have gotten rid of regulations that that   were unnecessary and we're job stifling   you have strengthened our borders and   strengthen our military you've nominated   a great Supreme superb Supreme Court   justice amongst many other things how   does all that feel and we're getting   unbelievable credit for what we've done   other than the mainstream media which   just gives us no credit whatsoever but   we are getting tremendous credit and if   you look at the real estate industry the   mining industry the farming industry if   you look at any of the major industries   you see what's going on in fact even   today I was very happy as i read this   morning early that our trade deficit   with others has gone down very   considerably in the last short period of   time now it's having a big impact and as   you know i'm meeting with the president   of China on thursday and friday in Palm   Beach Florida and I think we're going to   have a very interesting talk we're   having have a lot of respect for him   I've spoken to him numerous times but we   have to do better because our deficit   with China as you know 504 billion   dollars that's a year that's incredible   that's enough for a lifetime even Steve   would say that but that's a year so   we're going to have a great meeting I'm   sure we're gonna have a fantastic   meeting and we're going to talk about a   lot of things including of course North   Korea a problem   and that's really a humanity problem so   we're going to be talking about that   also you have made it a driving forces   administration to bring in the best   minds we can from the private sector to   listen intently to them and to take   decisive action how important is that   and how important is it to reform   government to bridge the gap between the   private and public sectors well I did I   brought you I born to Gary Cohn I   brought a lot of very great people of my   friend Steve is helping us out we have a   superstar committee of 22 people and   every time somebody calls me I say Steve   put them on no we want to keep it at   this level you know the heads of the   biggest companies they all want to be in   our committee right Steven but Steve   likes to keep it very small but they   will go off and they'll disappear and   we'll put others on but we've had some   great meetings and we've all learned a   lot one thing that did come up and it   came up yesterday was Gary Cohn where's   Gary see here could you bring that chart   please do you mind let me see that chart   so this was just something this is sort   of incredible that's so beautiful yeah   now you're not quite this is to build a   highway in the United States now this   was just done yesterday so for the first   time I said you know I'm speaking to   some of my friends who are builders   really great builders and they've gone   through the process we've all gone   through it in New York with as we called   the zoning process in New York but you   start up here and this is anywhere from   a 10 to a 20 year process you have is it   17 agencies you have hundreds and   hundreds of permits many of them are   statutory where you can't even apply for   the second permit until six months go by   at the process so this is to build a   highway this is a simple highway and   these are the agencies so it's 17   agencies how many different steps is it   DJ   sixteen nine different 29 different   statutes five different executive orders   that all apply to this process this is   indicative so this is not a specific   project that this is the type of process   that a government this is a state   government would have to go through to   permit a highway federally this is just   federal not state regulations so it can   take anywhere from ten if you're really   good ten years to 20 years and then they   vote and you lose they don't want it and   it costs sometimes hundreds of millions   of dollars just to go through the   process thank you very much it's a great   job you did be careful don't fall I   don't want to have you fall you'll be a   big story in the paper if you go down so   I just saw that yesterday Gary Cohn   walked in and he showed it to me and for   no reason I said you have to do me a   favor but a lot of you your such pros   some of the best pros in the world   sitting in this room you understand it   it's a process now I've always liked it   because it gave people they could go   through that process an advantage like   Jerry but it gave us an advantage if you   could get through the process but   getting a building approved in New York   is a horrible horrible thing and that's   nothing compared to when you get into   the highways and the dams they don't   even talk about dams anymore you know   hydropower is a great great form of   power we don't even talk about it   because to get the environmental permits   are virtually impossible it's one of the   best things you can do hydro but we   don't talk about it anymore so we've   come to a halt we have a tremendous   person that we put in charge of EPA   Scott Pruett who is an environmental   person he wants clean air he wants clean   water but he doesn't think it takes you   26 years to get a permit to build a   building and to have jobs at which time   those companies are usually gone out of   business etc so we're really speeding up   the process we're going to try and take   that process from a minimum of 10 years   down to one year I said can't we make it   four months can't we do it in four   months and there is a certain logic to   that but we'll be satisfied with the   year but it won't be any more than a   year   so we have to build roads we have to   build highways we're talking about a   very major infrastructure bill of a   trillion dollars perhaps even more and   when we have to do our jobs I mean if we   say we're giving two new york city   hundreds of millions of dollars to build   the road someplace it doesn't help if   they can't start because it's going to   take seven and a half years to get the   permits even to redo a road takes years   to get the permits you know you have a   road that's there and you want to redo   it and you have to get new permits for   the kind of asphalt you're using the   kind of concrete you may want to use and   if we're going to give all of this money   you know there was a very large   infrastructure bill that was approved   during the Obama administration a   trillion dollars nobody ever saw   anything being built I mean to this day   I haven't heard of anything that's been   built they used most of that money it   went and they used it on social programs   and we want this to be on infrastructure   i'm working with steve roth now with   richard lefrak two friends of mine that   are very good builders they're great   builders and they know how to get things   done they know how to cut red tape then   we're going to give them the advantage   of having what we have I see Elaine is   here so was so important to is doing an   incredible job by the way Secretary of   Transportation and Elaine will be   working but we're going to set up a   committee headed by Steve and Richard   and we're going to cut a lot of red tape   but we don't want to say send a billion   dollars to New York and find out five   years later the money who's never spent   because we're going to be very strong   that it has to be spent on on shovels   not on other programs and in the last   case a lot of it was spent on other   programs but we're going to say if you   don't spend the money if you don't start   if you have a job that you can't start   within 90 days we're not going to give   you the money for it because it doesn't   help doesn't help us and we're going to   be very strong on them they have to be   able to start within 90 days some of the   great business leaders in the country   here if ok with you they have a few   questions if that's great   hello Jerry he didn't have to say his   name if he was ready to say his name we   know we know Jerry Jerry spire everybody   mr. president you're doing great job and   we're all really grateful to you for the   sacrifices you're making ok hope you   heard that it sounds much better I think   from New York's point of view we send a   lot of money into the economy as a   number of people have said it's over   trillion dollars we're worried we're   going to have a problem with Congress   with the deductions right detach to have   to but we're worried about various   programs that help the city cities doing   fun   in the Yankees of the line   but what we're really concerned about is   in future you have any advice for us   look I Love New York and you know in   some ways we're all lucky that I'm from   New York because New York has unique   problems so does Los Angeles so does   Chicago you know there are places that   have unique problems one of the problems   that you have is debt and deduct ability   it's a big one because a lot of the   states that don't have debt or have very   little debt like in the case of Mike   Pence where he did such a good job in   Indiana and it's a triple a rated bond   one of the strongest in the country and   you know deduct abilities not that big   of a deal because they don't have that   much to deduct and over here you know   New York when you look at what's going   on with us we don't know in terms of the   municipality and in terms of the state   we don't know if it can even make it if   you don't have that are people going to   buy so it's a very big problem and the   problem I have is that there are many   places throughout the country that are   the exact opposite position and they   consider that a gift to the state and a   gift to the people and we know New York   just things that a lot of people don't   read about you know you look at what the   money that they contribute to our   economy to our country and people don't   know about that they don't maybe want to   know about that so you do have I call it   a tale of two cities you have different   different interests but I am watching   over everybody Jerry you're in good   hands okay you're in good hands believe   me you can tell the people of New York   even though I didn't win New York State   I should have won New York set but I mr.   president Kathy Engelbert with you Lily   I want to return to a conversation we   just have with Ivanka Dean and Wilbur on   jobs the workforce of the future and so   as we think about that and we think   about our skill sets in New York City   alone our high school public high school   graduation rate is at seventy percent   but the readiness of our students for   college and careers is only 37 is   assessed at thirty-seven percent so as   we look at the pace of change we look at   the digital transformation wheel   in business in the marketplace and we   look at the skills that we this   disconnect between what employers need   and what our students coming into our   workforces are prepared to deliver it   would be great to get your thoughts on   the priorities of the administration   around education around again what i   like to call not the future of work but   the work of the future because the   future work sounds a little ominous but   the work of the future actually sounds   pretty visionary so if you could give us   those priorities and how okay so before   you sit so you're giving me numbers from   New York you're a proud New Yorker but   you're giving me numbers why is it doing   so badly tell me why is why are the   numbers so horrific in terms of   Education and what happens when somebody   goes through school and then they can't   read after the you know they graduated   from high school and they can barely   read so what's the answer yes so first i   would say that as we look at New York   New York's made enormous progress in a   decade by the way that seventy percent   was fifty percent so a forty percent   increase so we're making enormous   project progress in making an impact   quickly she's changing that really   making enormous progress but we're not   done we have a lot of work to do and I   think we talked earlier about   public-private partnerships   apprenticeship models which we have a   beautiful apprenticeship model that   works and brings them our next   generation of leaders so I do think   there's a lot we can do through re   looking at

gracious the   most merciful your excellency mr.   president and dear friend to welcome you   here in Palestine and receive you as a   great guests of our people here in   Bethlehem way to do what slowly it will   be there the horrible terrorist attack   that occurred in Manchester City that   the British Minh City of Manchester   leaving tens of casualties and innocent   people and I do offer my warm   condolences to the Prime Minister of   Britain families of victims and the   British people your acts   your excellency meeting you meeting you   in the White House early this month has

ambition and that is a lasting and   justice faith peace our people our   Palestinian people's attainment of their   freedom and independence is the key to   peace and stability in the world so that

peace and forge an historic peace deal   with the Israelis and we would like to   with the Israelis and we would like to   reassert our willingness to continue to   work with you as partners in fighting   terrorism in our region and in the world   in this respect I commend the importance   of the holding of the Arab Islamic   American summit and its findings and   outcomes and conclusions your excellency   mr. president once again we reassert to   you our positions of accepting the   two-state solution along the borders of   1967 the state of Palestine with its   capital as is Jerusalem living alongside   the State of Israel in peace and   security and good neighborhood as well   as resolving the all the entire final   status issues based on international law   and in literature internationally the   determined resolution and respecting   side agreements which sits the tone for   the implementation of the IRA peace   initiative in accordance with with with   what has been reaffirmed in the most   recent Arab summit in Jordan your   excellency as you have witnessed during   your address so yesterday during your   historic historic business of holy sites   and occupied East Jerusalem and today in   Bethlehem the conflict is not between   religions for respecting religions and   prophets as an integral part of our   religion and faith and we are keen to   keep the door open today along with our   with the our Israeli neighbors from all   walks of life in order to boost   confidence and create a genuine peace   opportunity our fundamental problem is   with the occupation and settlement   and failure of Israel to recognize the   state of Palestine in the same way we   recognize it which undermines the   realization of the two-state solution   our the problem is not with between R   and D Judaism it's between us and   occupation I would like to draw the   attention to the issue of our   Palestinian prisoners who have been on   hunger strike for more than one month   meters away from here in the vicinity of   the Church of Nativity and and   everywhere all across South Side from   these mothers our prisoners suffer from   being denied visits to their children   and their demands are humane and just I   demand the Israeli government to meet   these humane legitimate demands   achievement of peace your excellency the   president will give us broad horizons   and prospects to recover our economy and   continue building our national   institutions based on rule of law and   with in the spirit of tolerance and   coexistence and a culture

Trump oral   America let me hop about esta la buena   lesson evil Israel in an aside ladies   emoji   lekha lacunae sericata here heavy as you   have Alma Nabil or Sammy   well Kabbalistic I would like to begin   by offering my prayers to the people of   Manchester in the United Kingdom I   extend my deepest condolences to those   so terribly injured in this terrorist   attack and to the many killed and the   families so many families of the victims   we stand an absolute solidarity with the   people of the United Kingdom so many   young beautiful innocent people living   and enjoying their lives murdered by   evil losers in life I won't call them   monsters because they would like that   term they would think that's a great   name I will call them from now on losers   because that's what they are they're   losers and we'll have more of them but   they're losers just remember that this   is what I've spent these last few days   talking about during my trip overseas   our society can have no tolerance   for this continuation of bloodshed we   cannot stand a moment longer for the   slaughter of innocent people and in   today's attack there was mostly innocent   children the terrorists and extremists   and those who give them aid and comfort   must be driven out from our society   forever this wicked ideology must be   obliterated and I mean completely   obliterated and the innocent life must   be protected all innocent lives life   must be protected all civilized nations   must join together to protect human life   and the sacred right of our citizens to   live in safety and in peace I want to   offer my deep appreciation to the   Palestinians and President Abbas for   hosting me today   it's an honor to join you in Bethlehem   the city that is precious to people from   all over the world's precious city as I   discussed with President Abbas in   Washington earlier this month I am   committed to trying to achieve a peace   agreement between the Israelis and the   Palestinians and I intend to do   everything I can to help them achieve   that goal President Abbas assures me he   is ready to work toward that goal in   good faith and Prime Minister Netanyahu   has promised the same I look forward to   working with these leaders toward a   lasting peace I also look forward to   working with President Abbas on other   important matters such as unlocking the   potential of the Palestinian economy   which is having a very rough time and   building on a very positive   counterterrorism   efforts several days ago in Saudi Arabia   I met with the leaders of the Muslim   world and Arab nations from all across   the region it was an epic gathering it   was a historic event King Salman of   Saudi Arabia could not have been kinder   and I will tell you he's a very wise   wise man I called on these leaders and   asked them to join in a partnership to   drive terrorism from their midst once   and for all it was a deeply productive   meeting people have said there have   really never been anything even close   in history I believe that being there   and seeing who was there and hearing the   spirit and a lot of love there has never   been anything like that in history and   it was an honor to be involved but great   things can come from that meeting I was   gratified that President Abbas joined   the summit and committed to taking firm   but necessary steps to fight terrorism   and confront its hateful ideology and   it's so interesting that our meeting   took place on this very horrible morning   of death to innocent young people peace   can never take root in an environment   where violence is tolerated funded and   even rewarded we must be resolute in   condemning such acts in a single unified   voice peace is a choice we must   each day in the United States is here to   help make that dream possible for young   Jewish Christians and Muslims children   all across the region in so doing we   will all enjoy a safer and brighter   future and a safer and brighter world in   this spirit of hope we come to Bethlehem   asking God for more peaceful safe and   far more tolerant world for all of us   I am truly hopeful that America can help   Israel and the Palestinians   forge peace and bring new hopes to the   region and its people I also firmly   believe that of Israel and the   Palestinians can make peace it will   begin a process of peace all throughout   the Middle East   and that would be an amazing   accomplishment thank you very much thank   you   [Applause]
EU0arvkr1Zg~Trump TV Network~20170412~President Donald Trump Press Conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg 4/12/2017~22601.0~4.31884050369~229.0~47.0~   ladies and gentlemen the President of   the United States and his Excellency yen   Stoltenberg secretary-general of the   North Atlantic Treaty Organization Thank   You Secretary General Stoltenberg it's a   pleasure to welcome you to the White   House especially at such an important   moment in our great alliance I also want   to acknowledge the great work being done   by our Secretary of State Rex Tillerson   to strengthen the NATO alliance as well   as the Secretary's trip to Moscow to   promote the security interest of the   United States and its allies he did a   terrific job   just watch parts of it did an absolutely   terrific job 68 years ago this month not   far from where we are gathered today   president Harry Truman spoke at the   signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in   the nearly seven decades since Harry   Truman spoke those words the NATO   alliance has been the bulwark of   international peace and security   NATO allies defeated communism and   liberated the captive nations of the   Cold War they secured the longest period   of unbroken peace that Europe has ever   known   this enduring partnership is rooted out   of so many different things but our   common security is always number one and   our common devotion to human dignity and   freedom since 1949 the NATO member   states have more than doubled increasing   from 12 to 28 on Monday I signed the   protocol to approve the 29th the country   of Montenegro   in the coming months and years   I'll work closely with all of our NATO   allies to enhance this partnership and   to adapt to the challenges of the future   of which there will be many this   includes upgrading NATO to focus on   today's most pressing security and all   of its challenges including migration   and terrorism we must also work together   to resolve the disaster currently taking   place in Syria we are grateful for the   support of NATO members and partners in   their condemnation of Assad's murderous   attack using the most horrible weapons   the vicious slaughter of innocent   civilians with chemical weapons   including the barbaric killing of small   and helpless children and babies must be   forcefully rejected by any nation that   values human life it is time to end this   brutal civil war to fiy terrorists and   allow refugees to return home in facing   our common challenges we must also   ensure that NATO members meet their   financial obligations and pay what they   owe many have not been doing that the   secretary-general and I agree that other   member nations must satisfy their   responsibility to contribute 2% of GDP   to defense if other countries pay their   fair share instead of relying on the   United States to make up the difference   we will all be much more secure and our   partnership will be made that much   stronger the secretary-general and I had   a productive discussion about what more   NATO can do in the fight against   terrorism I complained about that a long   time ago and they made a change and now   they do fight terrorism I said it was   obsolete it's no longer obsolete it's my   hope that   we'll take on an increased role in   supporting our Iraqi partners in their   battle against Isis I'm also sending   general McMaster to Afghanistan to find   out how we can make progress alongside   our Afghan partners and NATO allies   every generation is strive to adopt the   NATO alliance to meet the challenges of   their times and on my visit to Brussels   this spring which I look very much   forward to we will work together to do   the same   we must not be trapped by the tired   thinking that so many have but apply new   solutions to face new circumstances and   that's all throughout the world   we're not here to stand on ceremony but   to develop real strategies to achieve   safety security and peace we're here to   protect the freedom and prosperity of   our citizens and to give them the future   they so richly deserve secretary-general   I'm honoured to have you here today and   to reaffirm our commitment to this   alliance and to the enduring values that   we proudly and I mean very proudly share   thank you very much thank you for being   here thank you thank you so thank you so   much mr. president   we just had an excellent and very   productive meeting and it's really an   honor to meet you for the first time   here in the White House we agree that   NATO is a bedrock of security both for   Europe and for the United States two   world wars and a cold war have taught us   all that peace in Europe is not only   important for Europeans but it's also   important for the prosperity and the   security over North America so a strong   NATO is good for Europe but the strong   NATO is also good for the United States   and therefore a welcome   the very strong commitment of the United   States to the security of Europe we see   this commitment not only in words but   also in deeds over the past months   thousands of US troops have been   deploying to Europe a clear   demonstration that America stands with   allies to protect peace and defend our   freedom and yesterday you announced the   completion of the ratification or   Montenegro's membership in NATO another   expression of your strong commitment to   Europe and to the transatlantic bond and   we thank you for that in a more   dangerous and more unpredictable world   it is important to have friends and   allies and in NATO America has the best   friends and the best allies in the world   together we represent half of the   world's economic and military power no   other superpower has ever had such a   strategic advantage   this makes the United States stronger   and safer we saw that after the 9/11   attacks on the United States that was   the first time NATO invoked our article   5 to their collective defence close   allies sent AWACS surveillance planes to   help patrol American skies and we   launched NATO's biggest military   operation ever in Afghanistan hundreds   of thousands of Europeans and Canadians   soldiers have served   shoulder-to-shoulder with American   troops more than a thousand have paid   the ultimate price   earlier today I laid a wreath at   Arlington National Cemetery in tribute   to the fallen it was a deeply moving   experience   we owe it to our service men and women   to preserve the hard-earned gains we are   made together in Afghanistan we were   reminded of their sacrifice just this   week when a US soldier was kill their   fighting ISIL our mission in Afghanistan   is a major contribution to the fight   against international terrorism NATO   plays a key role in many other ways also   all NATO allies are part of the global   coalition to counter ISIL and need to   provide direct support the coalition   with training for Iraqi forces in the   fight against terrorists and more   intelligence sharing and you are right   we have established a new division for   intelligence which enhances our ability   to fight terrorism and working together   in the Alliance to fight terrorism in an   even more effective way but we agreed   today you and I that they too can and   must do more in the global fight against   terrorism in the fight against terrorism   training local forces is one of the best   weapons we have NATO has the experience   the expertise and the staying power to   make a real difference and fighting   terrorism will be an important topic   when NATO leaders meet in Brussels in   May the other major topic will be fair   burden-sharing in our alliance and we   had a total discussion on this issue   today and mr. president I thank you for   your attention to this issue we are   already seeing the effect of your strong   focus on the importance of   burden-sharing   in the alliance we agree that allies   need to redouble their efforts to meet   the pledge we all made in 2014 to invest   more in our alliance   it is about spending more on defense   it is about delivering the capabilities   we need and it is about contributing   forces to NATO missions and operations   this means cache capabilities and   contributions fair burden-sharing   has been my top priority since taking   office we have now turned a corner in   2016 for the first time in many years we   saw an increase in defense spending   across European allies and Canada a real   increase of 38 percent or 10 billion   dollars more for our defense we are now   working to keep up the momentum   including by developing national plans   out learning how to make good on what we   agreed in 2014 we know that we all need   to contribute our fair share because we   need to keep our nation safe in a more   dangerous world we discussed many   different topics during our meeting   today including the rendus use of   chemical weapons in Syria any use of   chemical weapons is unacceptable cannot   go unanswered and those responsible must   be held accountable so mr. president   thank you once again I look forward to   working with you to keeping the Alliance   strong and I look forward to welcoming   you to Brussels in May when heads of   state and government in the Alliance   need there to address the challenges and   they need to continue to adapt the   Alliance to more challenging security   environment and to respond both to the   need for further burden sharing and   stepping up our efforts to fight   international terrorism   so thank you once again thank you very   much great thank you   so we'll have a couple of questions Jeff   Mason   thank you Thank You mr. president   I'd like to ask you about two topics if   I may first has your view of Vladimir   Putin changed after what's happened in   Syria and what do you predict what is   the United States prepared to do if he   continues to support Assad and on a   separate question have you made a deal   after your chat last night with the   president of China about China helping   to rein in North Korea and is that one   reason you've decided not to label   Beijing a currency manipulator for   though I'll be speaking to yeah you want   to go ahead go ahead man for the   secretary-general   do you believe NATO should continue to   bolster its present presence along the   Alliance's eastern border and do you   have are you confident that you have   President Trump in the United States   support for that thank you I'll be   speaking with Rex Tillerson in a little   while calling in I think you had a very   successful meeting in Russia we'll see   we'll see the end result which will be   in a long period of time perhaps but the   end result is what's most important not   just talk and I think that based on   everything I'm hearing things went   pretty well maybe better than   anticipated it would be wonderful as we   were discussing just a little while ago   if NATO and our country could get along   with Russia right now we're not getting   along with Russia at all we may be at an   all-time low in terms of relationship   with Russia this is built for a long   period of time but we're going to see   what happens   Putin is the leader of Russia Russia is   a strong country we're a very very   strong country we're going to see how   that all works out last night   separately I spoke with a man that I've   gotten to know I don't know Putin but I   do know this gentleman I've spent a lot   of time with him over the last two days   and he is the president of China you   were there most of you were there and it   was quite an interesting period of time   president she wants to do the right   thing we had a very good bonding I think   we had a very good chemistry together I   think he wants to help us with North   Korea we talk trade we talk a lot of   things and I said the way you're going   to make a good trade deal is to help us   with North Korea otherwise we're just   going to go it alone   that'll be all right - but going it   alone means going it with lots of other   nations but I was very impressed with   President Xi and I think he means well   and I think he wants to help we'll see   whether or not he does you feel like you   have a deal with him and and if I could   just sir do you feel like you have a   deal with him in terms of the currency   manipulation designation and have your   views changed on Putin and we're going   to see we're going to see about that and   I'll also see about Putin over a period   of time be a fantastic thing if we got   along with Putin and if we got along   with Russia and that could happen and it   may not happen or maybe just the   opposite I can only tell you what I   would like to do I would love to be able   to get along with everybody right now   the world is a mess but I think by the   time we finish I think it's going to be   a lot better place to live and I can   tell you that speaking for myself by the   time I'm finished it's going to be a lot   better place to live in because right   now it's nasty NATO is in the process of   implementing the biggest reinforcement   of a collective defence since the end of   the Cold War and one element of that is   to increase our military presence in the   east and part of the alliance and we are   now deploying for battle groups to the   three Baltic countries and Poland and   there are also been more US forces in   that part of Europe and this is the   first time in many many years that we   see an increase in the military presence   of the United States in Europe so we are   increasing our presence and we are also   increasing the readiness and the   preparedness of forces so we can quickly   reinforce if needed we consider the   presence we will have when the four   battle groups are in place as sufficient   given the current security situation in   Europe but of course we will assess the   situation and follow the developments   very closely the message from NATO is   that what we do is proportionate it is   defensive and we don't want a new Cold   War we don't want a new arms race and   actually we strongly believe that there   is no contradiction between a strong   NATO a credible deterrence and defense   and political dialogue with Russia I   actually believe that the precondition   for the political dialogue with Russia   is that we are strong and that we are   united but based on that we can talk to   Russia because Russia's our neighbor   Russia said to stay so we have to find   ways to manage our relationship with   Russia and I am absolutely certain that   the United States supports this approach   partly because the United States is   contributing with forces to offer and   enhance the presence in eastern part of   the Alliance and also in the southeast   of the Alliance in Romania and the   United States and the president has   clearly expressed that they want   dialogue with Russia but based on unity   and strength in the Alliance then the   next question is from John Chappell   and thank you very much and   secretary-general how long do you think   it will take you to persuade the other   European countries to burden share and   what are you going to do to persuade   them mr. president could ask you you   don't get I'm here to help and and what   and mr. president do you think it's   conceivable what's your instinct was it   possible that Syrian forces could have   launched that attack in Italy last week   without the Russians knowing and have   you been disappointed surprised by   Vladimir Putin's reaction since then   thank you very much   I think it's certainly possible I think   it's probably unlikely and I know   they're doing investigations into that   right now   and I would like to think that they   didn't know but certainly they could   have they were there so we'll find out   general mattis is looking into it with   the entire Pentagon group that does that   kind of work so I was very disappointing   to see it's disappointing no matter who   does it but when you get into the gases   especially that form it's it's vicious   and violent and everybody in this room   saw it all too many times over the last   three or four days young children dying   babies dying fathers holding children in   their arms that were dead dead children   there can't be a worse sight and it   shouldn't be allowed that's a butcher   that's a butcher so I felt we had to do   something about it   I have absolutely no doubt we did the   right thing   and it was very very successfully done   as you well know thank you on defense   spending and burden sharing that has   been my top priority I have raised it in   all my meetings in all capitals I   visited with prime ministers presidents   Minister finance and of course also   defense on foreign ministers and I   expect of course all allies to make good   on what they decided back in 2014   the very strong and clear message from   President Trump has been very helpful so   now we see that things are starting to   move in the right direction for the   first time of after many many years of   decline in defense spending we now see   an increase in defense spending across   Europe and in Canada so they have   started to move in the right direction   38 percent real increase in defense   spending across Europe and Canada is a   significant step in the right direction   it's not enough we still have a long way   to go but at least they have turned the   corner a European allies have turned a   corner instead of reducing the fund   spending they started to increase   defense spending then I think it is   important to remember that this is   something the Europeans do because they   know that it this is in their own   security interest it is in their   interest to invest more in European   defence because the world has become   more dangerous many European allies of   course reduce or all European allies   reduce defense spending after the end of   the Cold War because then tensions went   down but if you are decreasing defense   spending when tensions are going down   then you have to be able to increase the   defense spending when tensions are going   up and now they are going up so we have   still a long way to go but I am   encouraged by the fact that we have   started to move in the right direction   and some laws there there are five   allies spending 2% this year   Romania has declared that we reach 2%   next year lockdown lit Rana will also   reach 2% so we go from 5 to 8 which is   at least going the right direction but   still we have a some work to do   and I did ask about all the money that   hasn't been paid over the years will   that money be coming back we'll be   talking about that we want to talk about   that to Anita Kumar where are you I claw   Chi we didn't talk last night I think   it's wonderful that they abstained as   you know very few people expected that   and no I was not surprised that China   did abstain very very few people thought   that that was going to happen so we're   honored by the vote that's the vote that   should have taken place in general   because they will probably love to   become number Moscow   the most important thing is to have a   strong alliance to stay united and be   firm and predictable in our approach to   Russia and that means that we have to   invest in our collective defence that's   exactly what we are doing deploy more   troops in eastern part of the Alliance   increase the readiness of our forces and   increase defense spending and I welcome   the very strong message from President   Trump on the importance of increased   defense spending we have started to do   this so we are implementing the biggest   reinforcement or collective defense   since the end of the Cold War   providing credible deterrence but at the   same time we how they have to find ways   to engage with Russia to talk with   Russia because Russia is not will not go   away Russia will be our biggest neighbor   and we have to find ways to live with   them and to try to avoid a new Cold War   a new arms race and that's exactly why I   am very much in favor of what we call   the dual-track approach to Russia and as   a former Norwegian politician I had the   experience to work with versions because   Norway's bordering Russia and all was   able even during the Cold War to develop   I would call the pragmatic working   relationship with Russia cooperating   with them on energy on on border issues   on environment on fishery and also in   military affairs and that was not   despite our membership in NATO but it   was because of our membership in NATO   because NATO provided the strength the   predictability the platform for a small   country to have a political dialogue   with Russia so I strongly believe that   the only way to deter Russia is to be   strong but the only way to avoid a new   Cold War avoid in your arms race and   avoid increasing tensions is to continue   to engage Russia in a political dialogue   and to make sure that what we do is   defensive and proportionate in response   to a more assertive Russia okay   then I use the four to twelve giggles   Thank You mr. president I'm from Norway   Russia is our neighboring country what   do you think you're a pastor fear from   Russia   if this tension continues say what do   you think that European countries have   to fear from Russia   if this tension continues oh sure what   what I'll do it again what what do you   think Russian what do you think European   countries have to fear from Russia   if this tension continues to escalate   and free mr. secretary-general the   president has set us the attack in Syria   last week was warranted and was also an   attack on on us allies you think that   this attack was warranted and you see   NATO playing any supporting role in   future actions in Syria well I wanted to   start by saying hopefully they're going   to have to fear nothing ultimately right   now there is a fear and their problems   is certainly problems but ultimately I   hope that there won't be a fear and   there won't be problems and the world   can get along that would be the ideal   situation it's crazy what's going on   whether it's the Middle East or you look   at no matter where the Ukraine you look   at whatever you look at it's got   problems so many problems and ultimately   I believe that we are going to get rid   of most of those problems and there   won't be fear of anybody that's the way   it should be we have a very big problem   in North Korean as I said I really think   that China's going to try very hard and   has already started a lot of the cold   boats have already been turned back you   saw that yesterday and today they've   been turned back the vast amount of coal   that comes out of North Korea going to   China they've turned back the boats   that's a big step and that many other   steps that I know about so we'll see   what happens it may be effective it may   not be effective it's not effective we   will be effective I can promise you that   thank you   NATO has constantly condemned   use of chemical weapons in Syria and the   use of chemical weapons is horrendous   and it's a clear violation of   international law and any use of   chemical weapons is unacceptable and   cannot go unanswered   so those responsible must be held   accountable the the strike against the   airbase in Syria it was a u.s. operation   based on US intelligence but you have   seen that within the Alliance this has   been something which has been met with a   lot of understanding because NATO allies   do not they accept you not accept that   chemical weapons are used and therefore   we also strongly support the efforts of   the fact-finding Commission to try to   find out actually what happened and to   make sure that we don't see any use of   chemical weapons in the future okay   thank you very much thank you   [Music]   [Music]   you   you

honors the median   of african-american men and women who   built our national heritage especially   when it comes to faith culture and the   unbreakable American spirit my wife was   here last week

great Museum   etched in the hall that we passed today   is a quote from Spotswood rice a runaway   slave who joined the Union Army he   believed that his fellow African   Americans always look to the United   States as the promised land of universal   freedom today and every day of my   presidency I pledge to do everything I   can to continue that promise of freedom   for african-americans and for every   American so important nothing more   important this tool is a meaningful   reminder of why we have to fight bigotry   intolerance and hatred in all of its   very ugly forms the anti-semitic threats   targeting our Jewish community and   community centers are horrible and are   painful and a very sad reminder of the   work that still must be done to root out   hate and Prejudice and evil I want to   thank a great friend of mine dr. ben   Carson and his beautiful family candy   and the whole family for joining us   today was very special to accompany him   and his family for the first

 many many people we're going to do great   things in our african-american   communities together Ben's going to work   with me very very closely and HUD has a   meaning far beyond housing if properly   done it's a meaning that's as big as   anything there is and Ben will be able   to find that true meaning and the true   meaning of HUD as its secretary so I   just look forward to that i would i look   forward to watching that he'll do things   that nobody ever thought of i also want   to thank senator Tim Scott for joining   us today friend of mine a great great   senator from South Carolina

Prime Minister I look forward to   working closely with you to build upon   our very historic friendship there are   incredible possibilities for us to   pursue Canada and the United States   together again thank you for joining us   and I know   our discussions will be very very   productive for the future of both   countries mr. prime minister Thank You   mr. president good afternoon everyone   thank you very much for joining us I'd   first like to start by extending my   sincere thanks to President Trump for   inviting me down to Washington any day I   get to visit our southern neighbors is a   good day in my books particularly when   it's so nice and warm compared to what   it is back home we are suffering under a   significant winter storm that's hitting   our Atlantic provinces particularly   harsh so I just want to send everyone   back at home my thoughts as they shovel   out and impress on everyone to stay safe   no please no my i have only in korea the   president of myself have had a very   productive first meeting today we had   the opportunity to get to know one   another better and more importantly we   had the opportunity to talk about the   unique relationship between canada and   the united states depends on both sides   of the 49th parallel have understood   that the bond between our nation's is a   special one no other neighbors in the   entire world are as fundamentally linked   as we are we fought in conflict zones   together negotiated environmental   treaties together including 1991's   historic air quality agreement and we've   entered into groundbreaking economic   partnerships that have created good jobs   for both of our peoples Canadians and   Americans alike share a common history   as well as people-to-people ties that   make us completely and totally   integrated our workers are connected by   trade transportation and cross-border   Commerce our communities rely on each   other for security stability and   economic prosperity our families have   long lived together and worked together   we know that more often than not our   victories are shared and just as we   celebrate together so to do we suffer   loss and heartbreak together through it   all the foundational pillar on which our   relationship is   guilt is one of mutual respect and   that's a good thing because as we know   relationships between neighbors are   pretty complex and we won't always agree   on everything but because of our deep   abiding respect for one another we're   able to successfully navigate those   complexities and still remain the   closest of allies and friends make no   mistake at the end of the day Canada and   the US will always remain each other's   most essential partner and today's   conversations have served to reinforce   how important that is for both Canadians   and Americans as we know 35 US states   list Canada is their largest export   market and our economies benefit from   the over 2 billion dollars in two-way   trade that takes place every single day   millions of good middle-class jobs on   both sides of the border depend on this   crucial partnership maintaining strong   economic ties is vital to our mutual   success and we're going to continue to   work closely together over the coming   years so the Canadian and American   families can get ahead come newly civil   your Canada lucrazon to Google as we   know 35 US states list Canada as their   largest export market and our economies   benefit from the over 2 billion dollars   in two-way trade that takes place every   single day millions of good middle-class   jobs on both sides of the both sides of   the border depend on this crucial   partnership maintaining strong economic   ties is vital to our mutual success and   week we're going to continue to work   closely together over the coming years   so that Canadian and American families   can get ahead   the president Trump and I discussed   today at the end of the day the   President and I share a common goal we   both want to make sure that hard-working   folks can go to work at a good job put   food on the table for their families and   save up to take a vacation every once in   a while that's what we're trying to do   here today we reiterated that our   nation's are committed to collaborating   on energy infrastructure projects that   will create jobs while respecting the   environment and as we know investing in   infrastructure is a great way to create   the kind of economic growth that our   countries so desperately need in that   same vein we know that ensuring equal   opportunities for women in the workforce   is essential for growing the economy and   maintaining American and Canadian   competitiveness on the world stage as   such the president and I have agreed to   the creation of the Canada United States   council for advancement of women   entrepreneurs and business leaders this   initiative is more than just about   dollars and cents this is about ensuring   that women have access to the same   opportunities as men and prioritizing   the support and empowerment of women who   are senior business leaders and   entrepreneurs in doing so will grow the   Canadian and American economies and help   our businesses prosper ef'n animal the   please don't rumba muah finally   president Trump and myself have agreed   to work together to fight against the   traffic of opioids across our border the   rise of illegal use of opioids in our   society is nothing less than a tragedy   we will do everything we can to ensure   the safety of Canadians and Americans   ladies and gentlemen president Trump I   know that if our countries continue to   work together our people will greatly   benefit from this cooperation it's time   and again that in order to tackle our   most pressing issues both foreign and   domestic we must work with our closest   allies learn from   and stand in solidarity as a united   voice with a level of economic and   social integration that is unmatched on   the world stage canada and the united   states will forever be a model example   of how to be good neighbors Winston   Churchill once said that long Canadian   frontier from the Atlantic to the   Pacific Oceans guarded only by   neighborly respect and honorable   obligations is an example to every   country and a pattern for the future of   the world that my friends is the very   essence of the canada-us relationship I   look forward to working with President   Trump over the coming years to nurture   and build upon this historic partnership   once again it's a tremendous pleasure to   be here in Washington Nextiva cool thank   you very much okay we'll take a couple   of questions Scott them and Scott   Thank You mr. president q you just spoke   about the desire to build bridges   although there are some notable and   philosophical differences between   yourself and Prime Minister Trudeau I'm   curious as you move forward on issues   from trade to terrorism how do you see   this relationship playing out in are   there any specific areas with which   during your conversations today you each   decided to perhaps alter or amend your   stance is already on those sensitive   issues like terrorism and immigration   and Prime Minister Trudeau while only in   its infancy so far how do you see this   relationship compared to that under the   Obama administration well we just began   discussions we are going to have a great   relationship with Canada may be as good   or better hopefully than ever before we   have some wonderful ideas on immigration   we have some I think very strong very   tough ideas on the tremendous problem   that we have with terrorism and I think   when we put them all together which will   be very very quickly we have a group of   very talented people we will see some   very very obvious results we're also   doing some cross-border things that will   make it a lot easier for trade and a lot   better and a lot faster for trade we   have through technology we have some   really great ideas and they'll be   implemented fairly quickly one of the   things we we spoke about was the fact   that security and immigration need to   work very well together and certainly   Canada has emphasized security as we   look towards improving our immigration   system and remaining true to the values   that we have and we had a very strong   and fruitful discussion on exactly that   there's plenty that we can draw on each   other from in terms of how we move   forward with a very similar goal which   is to create free open societies that   keep our citizens safe and that's   certainly something that we're very much   in agreement on Tony with Charles   mr. president mr. prime minister and mr.   prime minister could you answer in   English and French for us please a   little bit of a follow-on on my American   colleagues question a president Trump   you seem to suggest that Syrian refugees   are a Trojan horse for potential   terrorism while the Prime Minister hugs   refugees and welcomes them with open   arms so I'd like to know are you   confident the northern border is secure   you never be totally confident but   through the incredible efforts already I   see it happening of a formerly general   Kelly now secretary Kelly we have really   done a great job where were actually   taking people that are criminals very   very hardened criminals in some cases   with the which a with a tremendous track   record of abuse and problems and we're   getting them out and that's what I said   I would do I'm just doing what I said I   would do when we won by a very very   large electoral college vote and I I   knew that was going to happen I knew   this is what people were were wanting   and that wasn't the only reason that   wasn't my only thing and that we did so   well odd but that was something that was   very important and I said we will get   the criminals out the drug lords the   gang members we're getting about general   Kelly who's sitting right here is his   doing a fantastic job and I said at the   beginning we are going to get the bad   ones the really bad ones we're getting   them out and that's exactly what we're   doing I think that in the end everyone's   going to be extremely happy and I will   tell you right now a lot of people are   very very happy right now Canada has   always understood that keeping Canadians   safe is one of the fundamental   responsibilities of any government and   that's certainly something that we're   very much focused on at the same time we   continue to pursue our policies of   openness towards immigration refugees   without compromising security and   part of the reason where we were been   successful in doing that over the past   year welcoming close to 40000 Syrian   refugees is because we have been   coordinating with our allies the United   States and around the world to   demonstrate that security comes very   very seriously to us and that's   something that we that we that we   continue to deal with sickly ok it is   clear that if you want to have a healthy   and secure society you're safe society   you have to make sure that you maintain   that you focus on security and we have   welcomed refugees from Syria we have   been very successful but we have always   taken our responsibility towards   security very seriously and our allies   including the United States understand   this focus very well and they have done   so since the very beginning this place   you president Trump now that you've been   in office and received intelligence   briefings for nearly one month what do   you see as the most important national   security matters facing us and Prime   Minister Trudeau you've made very clear   that Canada has an open-door policy for   Sierra no Fugees do you believe that   president Trump's moratorium on   immigration has merit on national   security grounds okay thank you many   many problems when I was campaigning I   said it's not a good situation now that   i see it including with our intelligence   briefings we have problems that a lot of   people have no idea how bad they are how   serious they're not only internationally   but when you come right here with mean   obviously North Korea is a big big   problem and we will deal with that very   strongly we have problems all over the   Middle East we have problems just about   every corner of the globe no matter   where you look at a great meeting this   weekend with Prime Minister Abe a of   Japan and got to know each other very   very well extended weekend really   we were with each other for long periods   of time and our staffs and   Representatives but on the home front we   have to create borders we have to let   people that can love our country inn and   I want to do that we won't have a big   beautiful open door and we want people   to come in and come in our country but   we cannot let the wrong people in and I   will not allow that to happen during   this administration and people the   citizens of our country want that and   that's their attitude too I will tell   you we are getting such praise for our   stance and it's a stance of common sense   maybe a certain toughness but it's   really more than toughness it's a stance   of common sense and we are going to   pursue it vigorously and we don't want   to have our country have the kinds of   problems that you're witnessing taking   place not only here but all over the   world we won't stand for it we won't put   up with it we're just not going to let   it happen we're going to give ourselves   every bit of chance so that things go   well for the United States and they will   go well thank you canada and the united   states have been neighbors a long time   and Canadians and Americans have stood   together work together at home and   around the world we fought and died   together in battlefields in World War   One World War two in Korea in   Afghanistan but there have been times   where we have differed in our approaches   and that's always been done four million   respectfully the last thing canadians   expect is for me to come down and   lecture another country on how they   choose to govern themselves my role and   our responsibility is to continue to   govern in such a way that reflects   Canadians approach and be a positive   example in the world okay Fisher let all   this they shot at all ice Thank You mr.   prime minister well ask my question in   French first indent for you I'll get   again in English mr. plumbing is mr.   prime minister I heard you correctly you   said that Canadian businesses Canadian   workers are concerned for other   businesses and for their work and jobs   concerning the renegotiation of NAFTA so   what guarantees did you get from this   government that we will keep our jobs   and our businesses in the urine ago she   ation of NAFTA mr. president again   during the last three months you have   denounced NAFTA you have talked over and   over about the Mexican portion of the   agreement very little about the Canadian   one my questions in in two short part is   is Canada a fair trader and when you   talk about changes to NAFTA concerning   Canada are we again are you talking   about big changes or small chances thank   you bb shall music first of all in shock   thank you for your question it is a real   concern for many Canadians because we   know that our economy is very dependent   on our bonds our relationship with the   United States goods and services do   cross the border each way every single   day and this means a lot of millions of   jobs for Canadians and good jobs for   Canadians so we are always focusing on   these jobs but there are also good jobs   millions of jobs in the united states   that depend on those relationships   between our two countries   so when we sit down as we did today and   as our teams will be doing in the weeks   and months to come we will be talking   about how we can continue to create good   jobs for our citizens on both sides of   the border and during this exercise we   continue to understand that we have to   allow this free flow of goods and   services and we have to be aware of the   integration of our economies which is   extremely positive for both our   countries and this is the focus that we   will have in the coming weeks and months   to come where of the fact that much of   our economy depends on good working   relationship with the United States good   integration with the American economy   and the fact is millions of good jobs on   both sides of the border depend on the   smooth and easy flow of goods and   services and people back and forth   across our border and both President   Trump and I got elected on commitments   to support in the middle class to work   hard for people who need a real shot at   success and we know that by working   together by ensuring the continued   effective integration of our two   economies we are going to be creating   greater opportunities for middle-class   Canadians and Americans now and well   into the future I agree with that one   hundred percent we have a very   outstanding trade relationship with   Canada will be tweaking it will be doing   certain things that are going to benefit   both of our countries it's a much less   severe situation than what's taking   place on the southern border on the   southern border for many many years the   transaction was not fair to the United   States as an extremely unfair   transaction we're going to work with   Mexico we're going to make it a fair   deal for both parties I think that we're   going to get along very well with Mexico   they understand and we understand you   probably have noticed that Ford is   making   billions of dollars of new investments   in this country you saw in tell the   other day announce that because of what   I've been doing and what I'm doing in   terms of regulation lowering taxes etc   they're coming in with billions and   billions of dollars of investment in   thousands and thousands of jobs General   Motors likewise is expanding plans i'm   going to build new plants fiat-chrysler   was at a meeting where they're doing the   same Jack Ma we have so many people that   want to come into the United States it's   actually very exciting I think it's   going to be a very exciting period of   time for the United States and for the   workers of the United States because   they have been truly the forgotten man   and forgotten women it's not going to be   forgotten anymore believe me so a   relationship with Canada's outstanding   and we're going to work together to make   it even better and as far as the   southern border is concerned we're going   to get that worked out we're going to   make it fair but we are going to make it   so that everybody is happy it's very   important to me thank you thank you very   much thank you ladies and gentlemen   thank you very much   [Music]   you   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you   [Music]   [Music]   you

given   because it was the easy way it was the   traditional way or it was the accepted   way remember this nothing worth doing   ever ever   ever came easy following your   convictions   means you must be willing to face   criticism from those who lack the same   courage to do what is right and they   know what is right but they don't have   the courage or the guts or the stamina   to take it and to do it it's called the   road less traveled   I know that each of you will be a   warrior for the truth will be a warrior   for our country and for your family I   know that each of you will do what is   right not what is the easy way and that   you will be true to yourself and your   country and your beliefs in my short   time in Washington I've seen firsthand   how the system is broken a small group   of failed voices who think they know   everything and understand everyone want   to tell everybody else how to live and   what to do and how to think but you   aren't going to let other people tell   you what you believe especially when you   know that you're right   [Applause]   and those of you graduating here today   who have given half a million hours of   charity last year alone unbelievable   amount of work and charity and few   universities or colleges can claim   anything even close we don't need a   lecture from Washington on how to lead   our lives I'm standing here looking at   the next generation of American leaders   there may very well be a president or   two in our midst   anybody think they're going to be   President raise your hand in your hearts   are inscribed the values of service   sacrifice and devotion now you must go   forth into the world and turn your hopes   and dreams into action America has   always been the land of dreams because   America is a nation of true believers   when the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth   they pray when the founders wrote the   Declaration of Independence they invoked   our Creator four times because in   America we don't worship government we   worship God   [Applause]   that is why our elected officials put   their hands on the Bible and say so help   me God as they take the oath of office   it is why our currency proudly declares   in god we trust'   and it's why we proudly proclaim that we   are one nation under God every time we   say the Pledge of Allegiance the story   of America is the story of an adventure   that began with deep faith big dreams   and humble beginnings that is also the   story of Liberty University when I think   about the visionary founder of this   great institution Reverend Jerry Falwell   senior I can only imagine how excited he   would be if he could see all of this and   all of you today   and how proud he would be of his son and   of his family in just two days we will   mark the 10th anniversary of Reverend   Falwell passing and I used to love   watching him on television hearing him   preach he was a very special man he   would be so proud   not just that what you've achieved but   of the young men and women of character   that you've all become and Jerry I know   you're dead he's looking down on you   right now and he is proud he is very   proud so congratulations on a great job   Reverend Falwell 's life is a testament   to the power of faith to change the   world the inspiring legacy that we see   all around us in this great stadium this   is a beautiful stadium and it   is packed I'm so happy about that I said   how are you going to fill up a place   like that it is packed Jerry in this   beautiful campus and in your smiling   faces but it all began with a vision   that vision was of a world-class   University for evangelical Christians   and I want to thank you because boy did   you come out and vote those of you that   are old enough in other words your   parents boy oh boy you voted you voted   no doubt many people told him his vision   was impossible and I am sure they   continue to say that so long after he   started at the beginning with just 154   students but the fact is no one has ever   achieved anything significant without a   chorus of critics standing on the   sidelines explaining why it can't be   done nothing is easier or more pathetic   than being a critic because they're   people that can't get the job done but   the future belongs to the dreamers not   to the critics the future belongs to the   people who follow their heart no matter   what the critics say because they truly   believe in their vision at Liberty your   leaders knew from the very beginning   that a strong athletic program would   help this campus grow so that this   school might transform more lives that   is why a crucial part of Reverend   Falwell vision for making Liberty a   world-class institution was having a   world-class football team much like the   great teams of Notre Dame great school   great place in fact vice president Mike   Pence is there today doing a fabulous   job as he always does   a few years ago the New York Times even   wrote a story on the great ambitions of   the Liberty flames that story prompted a   longtime president of another school to   write a letter to Jerry   it's a letter that Reverend Falwell   would have been very very pleased to   read Jerry tells me that letter now   hangs in the wall in the board room of   your great University it came from the   late father Theodore Hesburgh who was   the beloved president of the University   of Notre Dame 35 years ago like this   school's founder he was a truly   kind-hearted man a very very deep faith   in the letter father Hesburgh recalled   that notre dame's own meteoric rise from   a small Midwestern school to a national   football powerhouse and then he wrote   something so amazing in generous he   wrote I think you are on that same   trajectory now and I want to wish you   all the best and encourage you from the   starting and from being able to start   very small and arriving in the big time   thanks to hard work great faith and   incredible devotion those dreams have   come true as the February of this year   the Liberty flames are playing in the   FBS the highest level of competition in   NCAA football don't don't clap that   could be tough   don't clap that could be tough I'm a   little worried I don't want to look at   some of those scores you're Jerry you   sure you know what you're doing here   those other players are big and fast and   strong but I have a feeling you're going   to do very well right from the most   humble roots you've become a powerhouse   in both education and sports and just   wait until the world hears the football   teams you'll be playing on your schedule   starting next season president Falwell   gave me a list of some of those schools   the ones you're going to be playing 2018   would you like me to read the names just   came out would you like to hear them I'm   a little bit concerned UMass Virginia   alburn Jerry are you sure you know what   you do Jerry or Bern   I don't know about that James this could   be trouble Jerry Rutgers Old Dominion   Brigham Young Army I might be at that   game Who am I supposed to vote for tell   me I don't know that's a tough one Jerry   I don't know Jerry I'm going to have to   think about that one Jerry Buffalo Troy   Virginia Tech oh no Jerry Ole Miss and   Wake Forest those it really top schools   that's maybe in four or five years   they'll come to a game right you'll   build it up   well good luck the success of your   athletic program arriving on the big   stage should be a reminder to every new   graduate of just what you can achieve   when you start small pursue a big vision   and never ever quit you never quit if I   give you one message to hold in your   hearts today it's this never ever give   up there'll be times in your life you'll   want to quit you'll want to go home   you'll want to go home perhaps to that   wonderful mother that's sitting back   there watching you and say mom I can't   do it I can't do it just   never quit go back home and tell mom dad   I can do it I can do it I will do it   you're going to be successful I've seen   so many brilliant people they gave up in   life they were totally brilliant they   were top of their class they were the   best students they were the best of   everything they gave up I've seen others   who really didn't have that talent or   that ability and there are among the   most successful people today in the   world because they never quit and they   never gave up so just remember that   never stop fighting for what you believe   in and for the people who care about you   carry yourself with dignity and pride   demand the best from yourself and be   totally unafraid to challenge entrenched   interests and failed power structures   does that sound familiar by the way the   more people tell you it's not possible   that it can't be done the more you   should be absolutely determined to prove   them wrong treat the word impossible as   nothing more than motivation relish the   opportunity to be an outsider embrace   that label being an outsider is fine   embrace the label because it's the   outsiders who change the world and will   make a real and lasting difference the   more that a broken system tells you that   you're wrong the more certain you should   be that you must keep pushing ahead you   must keep pushing forward and always   have the courage to be yourself most   importantly you have to do what you love   you have to do what you love I've seen   so many people they're forced through   lots of reasons sometimes including   family to go down a path that they don't   want to go down to go down a path that   leads them to something that they don't   love   that they don't enjoy you have to do   what you love or you most likely won't   be very successful at it so do what you   love I want to recognize a friend who is   here with us today who can serve as an   inspiration to us all   someone who doesn't know the meaning of   the word quit real champion a true true   champion both on the field off the field   he's a Hall of Fame quarterback for the   Buffalo Bills really a good friend of   mine an amazing guy Jim Kelly where's   Jim he's here someplace   where does Jim stand up Jim what a great   man Jim Kelly he was tough Jim do you   have any idea how much money you'd be   making today they'd hit Jim it was like   tackling a linebacker they'd hit Jim   four guys five guys that weighed 320 and   he'd just keep going down the field he   was much more than a quarterback he had   tremendous heart and he knew how to win   Jim is tough and his toughest fight of   all was that he beat cancer not once but   twice   [Applause]   and I saw him and his incredible wife as   they were in a very low moment Jill   very very low moment and it was amazing   the way they fought it didn't look good   I would have said maybe maybe it's not   going to happen but there was always   that hope because of Jim and Jim's heart   but I want to just say it's great to   have you here today Jim and these people   are big big fans and if you could get a   young version of Jim Kelly you'll be   beating a lot of teams Jerry so   interestingly though I said I wonder   what Jim's doing here his daughter Erin   crosses the goal line to you and today   with you so Erin stand up where are you   Erin where is Erin at congratulations   Erin congratulations   graduating from Liberty great choice   thank you   Liberty University is a place where they   really have true champions and you have   a simple cream that you live by to be   really champions for Christ whether   you're called to be a missionary   overseas to Shepherd a church or to be a   leader in your community you are living   witness of the Gospel message of faith   hope and love and I must tell you I am   so proud as your president to have   helped you along over the past short   period of time I said I was going to do   it and Geri I did it and a lot of people   are very happy with what's taking place   especially last week we did some very   important signings right James very   important signings America is better   when people put their faith into action   as long as I am your president no one is   ever going to stop you from practicing   your faith or from preaching what's in   your heart   [Applause]   we will always stand up for the right of   all Americans to pray to God and to   follow his teachings America is   beginning a new chapter today each of   you begins a new chapter as well when   your story goes from here it will be   defined by your vision your perseverance   and your grit that's a word Jim Kelly   knows very well your grit in this I'm   reminded of another man you know very   well and who has joined us here today   his name is George Rogers Liberty   University's CFO and vice president for   a quarter of a century during World War   Two George spent three and a half years   as a prisoner of war he saw many of his   fellow soldiers died during the Bataan   Death March he was the victim of   starvation and torture as a prisoner of   war when he was finally set free he   weighed just 85 pounds and was told he   would not live past the age of 40 today   George is 98 years old   [Applause]   right   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Applause]   that's so great George if anyone ever   had reason to quit to give in to the   bitterness and anger that we all face at   some point to lose hope in God's vision   for his life it was indeed George Rogers   but that's not what he did he stood up   for his country he stood up for his   community he stood up for his family and   he defended civilization against a tide   of barbarity the kind of barbarity we're   seeing today and we've been witnessing   over the last number of years and I just   want to tell you as your president we   are doing very very well   encountering it so you just hang in   there things are going along very very   well you'll be hearing a lot about it   next week from our generals things are   going along very very well through it   all he kept his faith in God even in the   darkest depths of despair like so many   others of his generation George came   home to a nation full of optimism and   pride and began to live out the American   dream he started a family   he discovered God's plan for him and   pursued that vision with all his might   pouring his passion into a tiny college   in a place called Lynchburg Virginia did   you ever hear of that Lynchburg we loved   it we loved it do you like it do we like   it right I flew over it a little while   ago it's amazing actually   what started as a dream with a few good   friends he helped Shepherd into the   largest Christian university in the   world just look at this amazing soaring   growing campus and I've been watching it   grow because I've been a friend of   Liberty for a long time now Jerry   a longtime thanks in great part to   George's financial stewardship hundreds   of thousands of young hearts and souls   have been enriched at liberty and   inspired by the Spirit of God George we   thank you and we salute you and you just   stay healthy for a long time George   thank you now it falls on the shoulders   of each of you here today to protect the   freedom that Patriots like George earned   with their incredible sacrifice   fortunately you have been equipped with   the tools from your time right here on   this campus to make the right decisions   and to serve God family and country as   you build good lives   you will also be rebuilding our nation   you will be leaders in your communities   stewards of great institutions and   defenders of Liberty and you will be   great mothers and fathers and   grandmothers and grandfathers loving   friends and loving family members you   will build a future where we have the   courage to chase our dreams no matter   what the cynics and the doubters have to   say you will have the confidence to   speak the hopes in your hearts and to   express the love that stirs your souls   and you will have the faith to replace a   broken establishment with a government   that serves and protects the people   [Applause]   we must always remember that we share   one home and one glorious destiny   whether we are brown black or white we   all bleed the same red blood of patriots   we all salute the same great American   flag and we are all made by the same   Almighty God as long as you remember   what you have learned here at Liberty as   long as you have pride and your beliefs   courage in your convictions and faith in   your God then you will not fail   [Applause]   and as long as America remains true to   its values loyal to its citizens and   devoted to its creator then our best   days are yet to come   I can promise you that this has been an   exceptional morning it's been a great   honor for me and I want to thank you the   students I also want to thank you the   family for getting them there and I want   to thank and congratulate Liberty may   God bless the class of 2017 may God   bless the United States of America may   God bless all of you here today thank   you very much thank you   [Applause]   you

television   okay ready thank you very much for being   here this morning today I'm pleased to   announce the official approval of the   Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL   pipeline TransCanada will finally be   allowed to complete this long-overdue   project with efficiency and with speed   we're working out the final details as   we speak it's going to be an incredible   pipeline greatest technology known to   man or woman and frankly we're very   proud of it Russ Girling president of   France Canada is right behind me and I'm   going to say a few words I no rush   you've been waiting for a long long time   and I hope you don't pay your   consultants anything because they had   nothing to do with like you should ask   for the hundreds of millions of dollars   back that he plays it into a damn thing   except no vote right it's a great day   for American jobs at a historic moment   for North America and energy   independence this announcement is part   of a new year of American energy policy   that will lower costs for American   families and very significantly reduce   our dependence on foreign oil and create   thousands of jobs right here in America   and I also would like to add I think   it's a lot safer to have pipelines than   to use other forms of transportation for   your product when completed the Keystone   XL pipeline will span 900 miles while   and have the capacity to deliver more   than 800000 barrels of oil per day to   the Gulf Coast refineries that's so big   by blood the fact is that this eight   billion dollar investment in American   energy was delayed for so long it   demonstrates how our government has too   often failed at citizens and companies   over the past long period of time today   we begin to make things right and   do things right today we take one more   step in putting the jobs wages and   economic security of American citizens   first put America first as the Keystone   XL pipeline now moves forward this is   just the first of many energy and   infrastructure projects that my   administration will approve and we've   already approved a couple of other big   ones very very big ones which will be   announcing soon in order to help put   Americans back to work grow our economy   and rebuild our nation and with that I'd   like to invite Russ to say a few words   russ is a very highly respected man in   the energy world he's president of   TransCanada and I know you will do a   fantastic job for us and get it up and   higher plenty of American people thank   you yes thank you mr. president and this   is a very very important day for us for   a company and so on behalf of thousands   of people that have worked very hard to   get here as you pointed out very long   time to get here but we're very relieved   and very much just want to get to work   some of those folks have with me today   the building trades which we saw on   garvey and some of our destruction   contractor quanta our pipe suppliers   from from wells fun there's thousands of   people that are just ready and itching   to get to work with a lot of work to do   in the field but as you pointed out this   is the safest and most reliable way to   move our products to market and we're   going to use the best technology and it   will create thousands of jobs and taxes   import tracks revenues in local   communities and that something often so   reluctant in projects like this is local   communities benefit greatly from these   projects it gives them tax revenues at   which they can invest in schools   hospitals roads teachers nurses on all   of those things built the fabric of   communities and make the bet place is   better for those photos to it so thank   you very much for this opportunity and   we're not going to let you down sir well   thank you russ an ideal I know the   voters appreciate this some of them   Express the driver strongly the workers   definitely appreciated that the building   trades heads did   but now maybe they're going to start to   wear my building I expect I think   they're gonna start to it because other   people we're not going to be signing   this bill that i can tell you and if it   ever did get done it would be years but   i don't think it would have ever gotten   done so we put a lot of people to work a   lot of great workers to work and they   did appreciate it and they appreciate it   a trust very much at the polls as you   probably noticed and so we're very happy   about it so the bottom line Keystone   finish they're going to start   construction when we got to see work to   do in Nebraska to get our permits   there's no basket forward to working   through co-op risk a local why you know   why the brisk is a great governor yeah   but ring cover we've been working there   for some time and I do believe that   we'll get through that process but   obviously have to engage with local   landowners tribal communities so we're   reaching out to those over the coming   months get the other necessary permits   that we need and then we look forward to   start construction okay i'm sure the   dress will do good Peters a fantastic i   would have done a great job and i'll   call him today so thank you all very   much appreciate it thank you   you   you   whole life   everybody afraid of live television okay   ready thank you very much for being here   this morning today

they said there is no path to   274 months I was hearing that you know   they're trying to suppress the vote so   they keep saying it so people say you   know I really like Trump he loves the   Second Amendment he loves the inner I   love him but let's go to the movie cuz   he can't win because they're trying to   suppress the vote but they say I mean a   hundreds of times I heard there is no   you know there's no route they say there   is no route to 270 and we ended up with   three or six so they were right not to   73 else that was some evening big sports   fans said that was the single most   exciting event they've ever seen that   includes Super Bowls and World Series   and boxing matches that was an exciting   evening for all of us and it meant a lot   only one candidate in the general   election came to speak to you and that   candidate is now the President of the   United States standing before you again   [Applause]   I have a feeling that in the next   election you could be swamped with   candidates but you're not going to be   wasting your time you'll have plenty of   those Democrats coming over and you're   going to say no sir no thank you no   ma'am perhaps ma'am   it may be Pocahontas remember that and   she is not big for the NRA that I can   tell you but you came through for me and   I am going to come through for you I was   proud to receive the NRA surliest   endorsement in the history of the   organization and today I am also proud   to be the first sitting president to   address the NRA Leadership Forum since   our wonderful Ronald Reagan in 1983 and   I want to thank each and every one of   you not only for your help   electing true Friends of the Second   Amendment but for everything you do to   defend our flag and our freedom with   your activism you help safeguard the   freedoms of our soldiers who have bled   and died for us on the battlefields and   I know we have many veterans in the   audience today and we want to give them   a big big beautiful round of applause   and like I promised we are doing a   really top job already 99 days but   already with the Veterans Administration   people are seeing a big difference we   are working really hard at the VA and   you're going to see it and you're   already seeing it and it's my honor I've   been telling you we're going to do it   and we're doing it thank you   the NRA protects in our capitols and   legislative houses the freedoms that our   service members have won for us on those   incredible battlefields and it's been a   tough fight against those who would go   so far as to ban private gun ownership   entirely but I am here to deliver you   good news and I can tell you that Wayne   and Chris have been fighting with me   long and hard to make sure that we were   with you today not somebody else with an   empty podium because believe me the   podium would have been empty they fought   long and hard and I think you folks   cannot thank them enough they were with   us all the way right from the beginning   but we have news that you've been   waiting for for a long time   the eight-year assault on your Second   Amendment freedoms has come to a   crashing end   [Applause]   you have a true friend and champion in   the White House no longer will federal   agencies be coming after law-abiding gun   owners no longer will the government be   trying to undermine your rights and your   freedoms as Americans instead we will   work with you by your side we will work   with the NRA to promote responsible gun   ownership to protect our wonderful   hunters and their access to the very   beautiful outdoors you met my son I can   tell you both sons they love the   outdoors frankly I think they love the   outdoors more than they love by a long   shot 5th Avenue but that's ok and we   want to ensure you of the sacred right   of self-defense for all of our citizens   when I spoke to this forum last year our   nation was still mourning the loss of a   giant a great defender of the   Constitution Justice Antonin Scalia I   promised that if elected I would   nominate a justice who would be faithful   and loyal to the Constitution I even   went one step further and publicly   presented a list of twenty judges from   which I would make my selection and   that's exactly what we did and by the   way I want to thank really heritage and   I want to thank also all of the people   that work to us where's Leo is Leo   around here   where is he he's got to be here he where   is he he has been so good but from and   also from heritage Jim DeMint it   been amazing I mean those those people   have been fantastic they've been real   they've been real friends the   federalists people where are they are   they around here someplace   they really helped us out I kept my   promise and now with your help our brand   new justice and he is really something   very special   Neal Gorsuch sits on the bench of the   United States Supreme Court for the   first time in the modern political era   we have confirmed a new justice in the   first 100 days the last time that   happened was 136 years ago in 1881 now   we won't get any credit for this but   don't worry about it   the credit is in the audience right the   credit is of the audience all of those   people they won't give us credit but   it's been a long time and we're very   honored we've also taken action to stand   up for America's sportsman on their very   last full day in office the previous   administration issued an eleventh-hour   rule to restrict the use of lead   ammunition on certain federal lands have   you heard about that folks I'm shocked   to hear that you've all heard about that   you've heard about that on his first day   as Secretary of the Interior   Ryan Zink he eliminated the previous   administration's ammunition ban he's   going to be great   Brian's going to be great we've also   moved very quickly to restore something   gun owners care about very very much   it's called   the rule of law   we have made clear that our   administration will always stand with   the incredible men and women of law   enforcement   in fact countless members of law   enforcement are also members of the NRA   because our police know that responsible   gun ownership saves lives and that the   right of self-defense is essential to   public safety do we all agree with that   our police and Sheriff's also know that   when you ban guns only the criminals   will be armed for too long Washington   has gone after law-abiding gun owners   while making life easier for criminals   drug dealers traffickers and gang   members in mace 13 you know about ms-13   it's not pleasant for them anymore folks   it's not pleasant for them anymore   that's a bad group not pleasant for   ms-13 get them the hell out of here   right get them out we are protecting the   freedoms of law-abiding Americans and we   are going after the criminal gangs and   cartels that prey on our innocent   citizens and we are really going after   them as members of the NRA no well some   of the most important decisions a   president can make our appointments and   I've appointed people who believe in law   order and justice   [Music]   that is why I have selected as your   attorney general number one a really   fine person a really good man a man who   has spent his entire career fighting   crime supporting the police and   defending the Second Amendment for the   first time in a long time you have a pro   Second Amendment tough-on-crime attorney   general and his name is Jeff Sessions an   attorney general sessions is putting our   priorities into action he's going after   the drug dealers who are peddling their   poison all over our streets and   destroying our youth he's going after   the gang members who threaten our   children and he's fully enforcing our   immigration laws in all 50 states and   you know what it's about time heading up   the effort to secure America's borders   is a great military general a man of   action homeland security director John   Kelly secretary Kelly who used to be   general Kelly is following through on my   pledge to protect the borders remove   criminal aliens and stop the drugs from   pouring into our country we've already   seen listen to this no it's never it's   never happened before people can't even   believe it and by the way we will build   the wall no matter how low this number   gets or how high the stuff don't even   think about it don't even think about it   [Applause]   you know they're trying to use this   number against us because we've done so   unbelievably at the borders already   they're trying to use it against us but   you need that wall to stop the human   trafficking to stop the drugs to stop   the wrong people you need the wall but   listen to this we've already seen a 73%   decrease never happened before in   illegal immigration on the southern   border since my election 73 percent you   see what they're doing right so why do   you need a wall we need a wall we'll   build the wall don't even think about it   don't even think about it don't even   think about it that's an easy one we're   going to build the wall we need the wall   I said to general Kelly how important is   that he said very important it's that   final element we need the wall and it's   a wall in certain areas obviously we   have these massive physical structures   you don't need and we have certain big   rivers at all but we need a wall and   we're going to get that wall and the   world is getting the message they know   that our border is no longer open to   illegal immigration and that if they try   to break in you'll be caught and you'll   be returned to your home   you're not staying any longer   and if you keep coming back illegally   after deportation you will be arrested   prosecuted and you will be put behind   bars otherwise it'll never end   let's also remember that immigration   security is national security we've seen   the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San   Bernardino hundreds of individuals from   other countries have been charged with   terrorism related offenses in the United   States we spend billions and billions of   dollars on security all over the world   but then we allow radical Islamic   terrorists to enter right through our   front door that's not going to happen   anymore it's time to get tough it's time   we finally got smart and yes it's also   time to put America first   [Applause]   and perhaps I see all of those beautiful   red and white hats but we will never   forget our favorite slogan of them all   make America great again   all right keeping our community safe and   protecting our freedoms also requires   the cooperation of our state leaders we   have some incredible pro-second   amendment governor's here at the NRA   conference including governor scott of   florida where's Governor Scott where is   great guy doing a great job governor   Bryant of Mississippi what a wonderful   place governor Bryant is here Thank You   governor deal of Georgia and we're also   joined by two people that well one I   loved right from the beginning the other   one I really liked didn't like and now   like a lot again does that make sense   senator David Perdue he was from the   beginning and Senator Ted Cruz like   dislike like where are they good guys   good guys smart cookies each of these   leaders knows that public officials must   serve under the Constitution not above   it we all took an oath to preserve   protect and defend the Constitution of   the United States and that means   defending the Second Amendment   [Applause]   so let me make a simple promise to   everyone of the freedom-loving Americans   in the audience today as your president   I will never ever infringe on the right   of the people to keep and bear arms   never ever freedom is not a gift from   government freedom is a gift from God   [Applause]   it was this conviction that stirred the   heart of a great American patriot on   that day April 242 years ago it was the   day that Paul Revere spread his   Lexington alarm the famous warning that   the British are coming the British are   coming right you've all heard that right   the British are coming now we have other   people trying to come but believe me   they're not going to be successful that   I could think nothing changes right   folks nothing changes they are not going   to be successful   you'll be serious hurt on them not on us   next came the shot heard round the world   and then a ragtag army of god-fearing   farmers frontiersmen shopkeepers   merchants that stood up to the most   powerful army at that time on earth the   most powerful army on earth but we   sometimes forget what inspired those   everyday farmers and workers in that   great war for independence many years   after the war a young man asked captain   levy Preston aged 91 why he fought   alongside his neighbors at Concord was   it the Stamp Act was it the T tax   was it a work of philosophy no the old   veteran replied then why he was as young   man the captain said what we meant in   going for those red coats was this we   always had governed ourselves and we   always meant to govern ourselves captain   Preston's words are a reminder of what   this organization and my administration   are all about the right of a sovereign   people to govern their own affairs and   govern them properly we don't want any   longer to be ruled by the bureaucrats in   Washington or in any other country for   that matter in America we are ruled by   our citizens we are ruled by each and   every one of you but we can't be   complacent these are dangerous times   these are horrible times for certain   obvious reasons but we're going to make   them great times again every day we are   up against those who would take away our   freedoms restrict our liberties and even   those who want to abolish the Second   Amendment we must be vigilant and I know   you are all up to the task since the   first generation of Americans stood   strong at Concord each generation to   follow has answered the call to defend   freedom in their time that is why we are   here today to defend freedom for our   children to defend the liberty of all   Americans and to defend the right of a   free and sovereign people to keep and   bear arms I greatly appreciated your   support on November 8th in what will   hopefully be   one of the most important and positive   elections for the United States of all   time and to the NRA I can proudly say I   will never ever let you down   thank you god bless you god bless our   Constitution and god bless america   thank you very much   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]

hZNOck5ZBA8~Trump TV Network~20170525~President Donald Trump Speech at NATO Summit in Brussels 5/25/2017~9814.0~4.54594612122~164.0~21.0~   thank you very much Secretary General   Stoltenberg Chancellor Merkel thank you   very much   other heads of state and government I'm   honored to be here with members of an   alliance that has promoted safety and   peace across the world Prime Minister   may all of the nations here today grieve   with you and stand with you I would like   to ask that we now observe a moment of   silence for the victims and families of   the savage attack which took place in   Manchester   thank you   terrible thing this ceremony is a day   for both remembrance and resolved we   remember and mourn those nearly 3000   innocent people who were brutally   murdered by terrorists on September 11th   2001 our NATO allies responded swiftly   and decisively invoking for the first   time in its history the Article five   collective defence commitments the   recent attack on Manchester in the   United Kingdom demonstrates the depths   of the evil we face with terrorism   innocent little girls and so many others   were horribly murdered and badly injured   while attending a concert beautiful   lives with so much great potential torn   from their families forever and ever   it was a barbaric and vicious attack   upon our civilization all people who   cherish life must unite in finding   exposing and removing these killers and   extremists and yes losers they are   losers wherever they exist in our   societies we must drive them out and   never ever let them back in this goal   for driving out terrorism is a message I   took to a historic gathering of Arab and   Muslim leaders across the region hosted   by Saudi Arabia there I spent much time   with King Salman a wise man who wants to   see things get much better rapidly the   leaders of the Middle East too   greed at this unprecedented meeting to   stop funding the radical ideology that   leads to this horrible terrorism all   over the globe my travels and meetings   have given me renewed hope that nations   of many faiths can unite to defeat   terrorism a common threat to all of   humanity terrorism must be stopped in   its tracks or the Hara you saw in   Manchester and so many other places will   continue forever you have thousands and   thousands of people pouring into our   various countries and spreading   throughout and in many cases we have no   idea who they are   we must be tough we must be strong and   we must be vigilant the NATO of the   future must include a great focus on   terrorism and immigration as well as   threats from Russia and on NATO's   eastern and southern borders these grave   security concerns are the same reason   that I have been very very direct with   Secretary Stoltenberg and members of the   Alliance in saying that NATO members   must finally contribute their fair share   and meet their financial obligations but   23 of the 28 member nations are still   not paying what they should be paying   and what they are supposed to be paying   for their defence this is not fair to   the people and taxpayers of the United   States and many of these nations Oh   massive amounts of money from past years   and not paying in those past years over   the last eight years the United States   spend more on defense than all other   NATO countries combined   if all NATO members had spent just 2% of   their GDP on defense last year we would   have had another 119 billion dollars for   our collective defense and for the   financing of additional NATO reserves we   should recognize that with these chronic   underpayments and growing threats even   2% of GDP is insufficient to close the   gaps in modernizing readiness and the   size of forces we have to make up for   the many years lost 2% is the bare   minimum for confronting today's very   real and very vicious threats if NATO   countries made their full and complete   contributions the NATO would be even   stronger than it is today especially   from the threat of terrorism I want to   extend my appreciation to the 9/11   Memorial and Museum in New York for   contributing this remnant of the North   Tower as well as to Chancellor Merkel   and the German people for donating this   portion of the Berlin Wall it is truly   fitting that these two artifacts now   reside here so close together at the new   NATO headquarters and I never asked once   what the new NATO headquarters cost I   refuse to do that but it is beautiful   each one marks a pivotal event in the   history of this alliance and in the   eternal battle between good and evil on   one side a testament to the triumph of   our ideals over a totalitarian communist   ideology bent on the oppression   of millions and millions of people on   the other a painful reminder of the   barbaric evil that still exists in the   world and that we must confront and   defeat together as a group as a world   this twisted mass of metal reminds us   not only of what we have lost but also   what forever endures the courage of our   people the strength of our resolve and   the commitments that bind us together as   one we will never forget the lives that   were lost we will never forsake the   friends who stood by our side and we   will never waver in our determination to   defeat terrors and to achieve lasting   security prosperity and peace thank you   very much it's a great honor to be here   thank you   [Applause]   you

 that's right it was TV Katie BF   Fairbanks and the mighty night k frp   radio TV yo spot it's a great business   the women i do business driven to   decking so why they say i have a face   for radio   chairman   hello everybody   [Applause]   mr. vice president I want to thank each   of the house committee leaders for being   with us today the devotion and   leadership has been amazing I one just   upload you and the diligent work of your   committees to advance the Obamacare   repeal and replacement legislation that   we've been talking about for a long time   and that we've been running with and I   ran with it I can tell you and that's   what people want they want repeal and   replace the bill passed just now through   ways and means and it will I think the   committee have just voted recently right   of your other committee energy energy   and commerce then it was a very good   vote and the congratulations it was a   good job amazing we must act now to save   americans from the imploding Obamacare   disaster premiums have skyrocketed by   double digits and triple digits in some   cases and as an example Arizona which I   talk about all the time a hundred and   sixteen percent increases going up a lot   higher 17 would be a disaster for   Obamacare that's the year was meant to   explode because Obama won't be here that   was when it was supposed to be really   can even worse as bad as it is now it'll   get even worse choices are disappearing   as one insurer drops out after another   today one-third of all counties now have   only one insurer from the Obamacare   exchanges and the exchanges themselves   are a disaster the house repeal and   replace plan ends the Obamacare tax   hikes cutting taxes but disaster the   house repeal and replace plan ends the   Obamacare tax hikes cutting taxes by   hundreds of billions of dollars it   eliminates the Obamacare mandate that   forces Americans to buy   government-approved plans we all know   that one it provides states with   flexibility over how Medicaid dollars   are spent giving power from Washington   and back to local government which we   all want to see they're going to do a   much better job and the plan empowers   individual Americans to buy the health   insurance that is right for them not the   plan forced on them by government you   all remember you can keep your doctor   you can keep your plan I know a great   you've never heard that right but it was   said many many times and it turned out   to be not true this is the time we're   going to get it done while working   together we have some great results we   have tremendous spirit and I think it's   something that's just going to happen   very shortly so thank you all very much   we're going to get to work   rushmere are your battery looks over   here   to heart   [Music]   good morning I'm Greg Walden I chair the   Energy and Commerce Committee I'm joined   by the chairman of the Ways and Means   Committee miss Brady chairman the   education Workforce Committee and the   chairman of the Budget Committee we just   had a very productive meeting with the   President the Vice President we're   really excited about the unified boats   we had on our bills coming out of our   committees we had every Republican on   every vote and we are ready to move   forward to repeal and replace Obamacare   and restore power to the states and put   Medicaid on a budget while not giving   any room for people to fall through the   cracks get this insurance market up and   operating in a way that will work for   people so they can afford insurance   again and so we're we're very excited   about how this went the president   renewed his commitment to our process   and was very pleased with our work and   we look forward to moving forward with   that alternate over the germ of the Ways   and Means Committee Kevin Brady thank   you Greg make no mistake this was a   historic week in the United States after   seven long years of many Americans being   heard by Obamacare the process begins in   in real time to repeal this law and   begin replacing it with affordable   health care in the Ways and Means   Committee 18 hours of deliberation   Republicans unified in support of this   bill and for this reason and if you hear   nothing else I say today this is the   most important one there is so much more   that unites Republicans then divides   Republicans on this issue repealing   these awful taxes those subsidies those   mandates that have hurt our local   businesses we unite behind beginning to   restore state control beginning to give   people real power and choice over their   health care plan is what we all unite   behind will continue to listen will   continue to make improvements where we   can but there's no question this is the   bill that the end the day will come to   the press   his desk repeal Obamacare and to begin   to give Americans hope and relief again   and we are very much in favor of the   three-pronged approach that we're doing   we know we're limited in what we can do   in reconciliation which is step one but   step 2 and step three are coming very   quickly after that and in fact education   and Workforce Committee passed three   bills this week that augment that third   bucket that the speaker has been talking   about the president's talking about so   we're moving forward and we are unified   we want to repeal Obamacare and replace   it with patient-centered health care as   the chairman of the Budget Committee and   also as a nurse I do understand health   care and I'm very excited about getting   the bill that comes from Energy and   Commerce and also from ways and means   and being able to bring those two bills   together into one unified bill which   will be sent on to the Rules Committee   having been with my members of the   Budget Committee today we are unified in   what will be coming out of that bringing   together of those two bills and it's   very exciting for me as a nurse and   especially in a state where we see an   absolute implosion of what's happening   in Obamacare we actually have many many   counties in the eastern part of our   state that do not have a single provider   on the marketplace we are rescuing the   American people and for a nurse this is   something that excites me to see that   we're going to have patient-centered   health care once again for the people of   this country okay   senator cotton says you should hit the   pause button start over because this   bill he says has no chance of passing at   the Senate what do you say well what I'd   say is we move forward a very open and   deliberative process I look forward to   working with him and other senators to   move this thing forward I think it's the   reforms that the American people ask us   to do we are ready to go in the worst   thing we could do is hit the pause   button and continue Obamacare and it's   broken policies that are hurting our   people and so we look forward to working   I know tom toms ofrenda served with him   in the house I think we've got a very   good piece of legislation here that is   the right step forward to keep the   promise to the American people to repeal   and replace Obamacare and it's time we   move forward are you open to major   changes just go ahead can you explain   well you're going to see not only the   changes we made in this plan to ball   back to the states more authority to   take care of their the patients and   people they serve but also we put in   place funds that they will be able to   access directly to take care of people   who are afflicted with various issues   including a drug addiction or mental   health issues so we care very much about   that and so there there's through the   patient and state state stability fund   there's money there 100 billion dollars   over ten years states will be able to   make that decision and they'll have more   flexibility and how they how they manage   the people that they care for it today   they won't have to come to Washington to   get approval from somebody Packers a   nice cravat he's sort of notable up   earlier and one   the points well   it forces people to find plans that have   features that they don't   health insurance what sort of coverage   levels considered appropriate and yeah   it's a good question I'm just   catastrophic cover right and so we have   that safeguard in the bill we move   forward but we also allow some   flexibility because now people are being   forced to buy plans that don't work for   them they can't afford so they pay the   IRS the tax penalty instead they don't   get into the market and forty five   percent of those are under the age of 35   so younger people that we need in the   market we need to fix a plan that works   for that age group and we've done that   here good morning I spoke with them well   probably got eight times said they're   getting emails and letters this morning   from constituents saying why don't you   just give us the plan the Congress has   can you address that situation why can't   Congress just do that to any real thing   I appreciate that plan because I'm in   the end in the DC shop exchange under   Obamacare so when when we fix Obamacare   or we don't fix Obamacare were directly   affected I'm on a blue cross plan   through the obamacare exchange right   here in Washington by law that's where   we belong I supported that all along so   I'm seeing it too as our premiums go up   and our costs go up I live in it and so   we have that I you know I want to get   back to where we all have better choices   that's where we're headed in this what's   it wouldn't follow up the back Thank You   mr. chairman

areas under its   administrative control and to further   strengthening our very crucial alliance   the us-japan alliance is the cornerstone   of peace and stability in the Pacific   region it is important that both Japan   and the United States continue to invest   very heavily in the Alliance to build up   our defense and our defensive   capabilities which under a mutual   leadership will become stronger and   stronger and as time goes by ultimately   they will be impenetrable we faced   numerous challenges and bilateral   cooperation is essential our country is   committed to being an active and fully   engaged partner   we will work together to promote our   shared interests of which we have many   in the region including freedom from   navigation and of navigation and   defending against the North Korean   missile and nuclear threat both of which   I consider a very very high priority on   the economy we will seek a trading   relationship that is free fair and   reciprocal benefiting both of our   countries the vibrant exchange between   us is a true blessing Japan is a proud   nation with a rich history and culture   and the American people have profound   respect for

Prime Minister obey on behalf   of the United States of America I thank   you for being with us today we will soon   be traveling to the great state of   Florida where I know we will have a long   and very successful talk negotiations   and a very very productive weekend mr.   prime minister   this is the fourth time in 6 months for   me had to visit the United States the   last time was in pearl harbor hawaii at   the end of last year i am indeed   sincerely grateful for what the always   heartwarming welcome accorded to me by   the american people i would also like to   express my sincere gratitude to   President Trump Oh Donald you must have   been very busy in this very important   the period of a hundred days after your   inauguration in fact you very much for   inviting me over her to the White House   my name is Abbot a but in the United   States some people mistakenly pronounce   my name is ape but that is not bad   because even in Japan everybody knows   the name of that great president that   farmer carpenter's son can become a   precedent and that fact 150 years ago   surprised the Japanese who were still   under the Shogunate a rule the Japanese   opened their eyes to democracy United   States is the champion of democracy   Donald president you are excellent   businessman but you have never been in   the Congress or being a governor you   have not experienced being in the public   office but you have fought the uphill   struggle and fight for more than a year   in the election campaign to become a new   president and this is the dynamism of   democracy I would like to celebrate and   congratulate Donald been sworn in as the   president the United States is a country   having the largest number of chances   opportunities in the world that has   always been the case right now as well   as going forward this will never change   and that is the reason why automotive   industries and other Japanese the   businesses   build factories all over the United   States to engage in local production   here last year from Japan to the United   States there have been more than 150   billion dollars of new investment being   made into the United States and those   Japanese businesses have created large   number of jobs but the mutually   beneficial economic relations have been   built by Japan in the United States with   President Trumper are taking on the   leadership I'm sure they will be major   scale infrastructure investment will be   made including the fast speed train   those of you who have rode on the   Japanese Shinkansen I'm sure you would   appreciate the speed the comfort and   safety with the latest maglev technology   from the Washington DC at to New York   where Trump Tower exists only one hour   would it take if you ride the maglev   train from Washington DC head to New   York Japan with that are high level of   technical capability we will be able to   contribute to president Trump's growth   strategy there will be even more new   jobs been born in the United States but   to further deepen digit bilateral   economic relations between Deputy Prime   Minister a soul and vice president pants   there will be a cross-sectoral dialogue   to be held and we have agreed on this   and furthermore in asia-pacific where we   see dramatic growth to expand free trade   and investment this will be a big chance   for both Japan and United States but of   course it must be done in a fair manner   never should a state-owned company   backed by state capital should not make   any economic intervention free ride on   intellectual property property should   not be condoned in asia-pacific region   with Japan in u.s. taking on the   leadership to create free and fair   market based upon rules should be built   I and president Trump has confirmed on   our strong will to do so the cornerstone   of peace and prosperity in asia-pacific   that that is the strong japan-us   alliance and this is an unwavering ties   between our two countries I and   president Trump will work together to   further strengthen our alliance we have   shared this strong resolve as we see   increasingly difficult security   environment we have confirmed that the   us-japan security pact article 5 will be   applied a to think that the islands the   United States will strengthen its   presence in division and under the   banner of the proactive contribution to   peace Japan and will play a greater role   at the same time we will maintain the   deterrence and also her to proceed on   reducing the impact we had a will for   through on her that the realignment of   the US forces in Japan and hello goes   relocation to Henoko of the MCAS Futenma   is the only solution and Japan and us   will continue to her to work closely on   this on North Korea we heard the word   the strongly ally demand North Korea to   abandoned nuclear and ballistic missile   the program and not had to make any more   provocations and we have completely   agreed on the importance offered the   early solution for the abduction issue   in East China Sea South China Sea and   Indian Ocean everywhere we need her to   maintain her the freedom of navigation   and rule of law in such international   order the master had to be he maintained   japan in united states have confirmed   that we will strongly a protest any use   of force as well as radical ocean to   change the status full i ended the   president will address not only   bilateral but regional hood issues and   we have had a very frank exchange of   views on the peace and prosperity of the   world that we should contribute for any   form over terrorism should be strongly   condemned and we hear the word to   cooperate but in our fight against   terrorism japan had a will of course   exercise orca metric troll in this   regard and furthermore or the regional   conflict there are the refugees of   poverty and infectious diseases there   are many hit the challenges faced by the   world which will hook will be a serious   issue that to threaten the peace and   stability for japan as well as the   United States but Japan in the United   States and the international community   must work hand in hand in order solve   these questions of course there are   disagreements but we should not close   down but they had a dialogue just by   pointing to the differences and ignoring   the common interests and common goals we   need to have a dialogue because there   are disagreements what do we mostly   desire what is most desired by those who   are challenging the existing   international order is that you just   focus on differences we should not close   a deal dialogue Japan at the half for   four years and I have consistently   fought through her on   our foreign policy now whatever the   challenge and difficulty ahead of us I   and Trump a president Trump I will   continue our dialogue or to seek shared   solutions and after lunch shirt I'm   looking forward at for weekend in   Florida with Donald we will play golf   together my scores in golf will is not   up to the level of Donald at all but my   policy is never up never in always   aiming for worthy the cup never had to   to just the goal with the shortcuts and   short the chops that those are the words   never found in my dictionary but in a   relaxed atmosphere I hope to take time   to discuss with Donald on the future of   the world future of the region and   future of Japan in United States thank   you much we'll take a few questions   unless you don't want to ask any   questions if that's possible maybe we'll   start where is the Daniel helper New   York Post Daniel   I'm curious about yesterday's ruling in   the Ninth Circuit Court has it caused   you to rethink your use of executive   power and how will you respond and will   you sign new executive orders and   perhaps a new travel ban and mr. prime   minister I'm curious about your reaction   to America's withdrawal from the   trans-pacific partnership the TPP do you   think that that's weakened America's put   a position in Asia and how do you think   had you envisioned it any sort of trade   deal with the president working out well   your question was unrelated to what   we're here for today but I'll answer it   we are going to keep our country safe we   are going to do whatever is necessary to   keep our country safe we had a decision   which we think will be very successful   with it shouldn't have taken this much   time because safety is a primary reason   one of the reasons I'm standing here   today the security of our country the   voters felt that I would give it the   best security so we'll be doing   something very rapidly having to do with   additional security for our country   you'll be seeing that sometime next week   in addition we will continue to go   through the court process and ultimately   I have no doubt that will win that   particular case   [Music]   now in the world we are also facing her   we had issues of refugees and terrorism   we need to work closely together on   these global issues Japan they have   always played our own role but going   forward or we would continue to work   with the international community to   execute a responsibility in a   commensurate manner and each of our   country has immigration control a scheme   as well as policy on immigration as well   as refugees these are to do with   domestic affairs of that country so I   would refrain from making any comments   okay Blake Berman Fox Blake Berman   [Music]   Thank You mr. president I'd like to pick   up where where Daniel left off if you   don't mind you said earlier this week   and I'm quoting for you said I've   learned a lot in the last two weeks and   terrorism is a far greater threat than   the people of our country understand but   we're going to take care of it based off   of what you have learned and now knowing   that your executive order is at least   temporarily on hold do you still feel as   confident now as you have been at any   point that you and the administration   will be able to protect the homeland and   mr. prime minister thank you I would   just like to pick off again on what   Daniel had asked about TPP do you feel   it's a mistake that the United States   has at least signaled its intention to   withdraw from the deal thank you both I   feel totally confident that we will have   tremendous security for the people of   the United States we will be extreme   betting which is a term that I developed   early in my campaign because I saw what   was happening and while I've been   president which is just for a very short   period of time I've learned tremendous   things that you could only learn frankly   if you were in a certain position namely   president and there are tremendous   threats to our country we will not allow   that to happen I can tell you that right   now we will not allow that to happen so   we'll be going forward and we'll be   doing things to continue to make our   country safe it will happen rapidly and   we will not allow people into our   country who are looking to do harm to   our people we will allow lots of people   into our country that will love our   people and do good for our country it's   always going to be that way at least   during my administration I can tell you   that   inaho a TPP into tava on TPP of course   we are fully aware of president Trump's   a decision on economic issues we will be   discussing at the working lunch to   follow as for Japan in the United States   a trade and investment as well as   economic relations how can we develop   and grow our relationship as I have   already mentioned a deputy prime   minister also and vice president pens I   will create a new framework for dialogue   and I am quite optimistic that had the   good results will be seen from the   dialogue now a faux hawk would be free   and fair common set of rules to be   created for the free trade regime in the   head region and that was the purpose of   TPP and that the importance have not   changed I'm myself believe that who's   embassy in HK know her too much man   thank you my name is Hannah from NHK I   have a question to Prime Minister other   now for the automotive market in Japan   as well as foreign exchange of for Japan   in the prior remark so they're happy   discrepancy in your positions so at the   summit meeting what were the discussions   and were you able to narrow down the gap   and president that Trump had said that   he will make United States a great a   country what there is it's meant by the   great country and Prime Minister what do   you mean when you say United States is a   great ally for you now with the birth of   the trump administration the new genesis   will have to be built between Japan and   us in economics in order to put forward   such strong message I have proposed to   launch a new framework a for economic   dialogue and we were able to agree on   this as for   sectoral our discussions we will be   having a discussion at our working lunch   in any case between president Trump and   I myself on Japan and US economic   relations we will we have already agreed   that we will have vice president Pence   and deputy prime minister also or to   discuss fully on her the economic   relations between our two countries and   we are looking forward for the good   results so to ensue from the debate   between rather be at experts at 40   foreign exchange or we will have   Secretary of Treasury and Minister of   Finance I will continue at the close   communication for the United States to   become a great nation the various roles   played by her the United States and the   responsibility to go with it the hold   over is faced with increasing   uncertainty that United States will   become a great america and become a   great and strong ally would be good for   japan and for Japan and us alliance to   be further strengthened would be good   not only for two nations but also   contribute to the peace and prosperity   of asia-pacific and the United States to   become even greater we will welcome that   thank you i will say that and you've   seen it ever since I won the election   and became president elect I've been   telling companies car companies and   other companies many companies come back   into the United States and they've been   coming back in and big announcements are   going to be made over the next short   period of time some of you already know   what those announcements are we lost a   lot of our factories a lot of our plants   and those factories of those plants will   be coming back and jobs will be coming   back to Michigan and Ohio and   Pennsylvania and North Carolina and so   many other places where we've   lost so many jobs and those are the   people that were so good to me and now   I'm being good to them so we've had a   tremendous number of announcements we've   had Ford and General Motors and many   many others Intel yesterday made a major   announcement and they did that because   of what is happening with our tax   structure which is going along very well   and we'll be having some very big news   over the next short period of time but   we are a nation of tremendous potential   and the expression make America great   again i will tell you and i will add   very struggling with greater surety it   will be greater than ever before and i   just want to thank the prime minister   for a friendship you know we developed a   great friendship when we met in New York   City at Trump Tower we spoke for a long   long period of time and when I greeted   him today at the car i was saying i   shook hands but I grabbed him and hugged   him because that's the way we feel we   have a very very good bond very very   good chemistry I'll let you know if it   changes but I don't think it will so I   just want to I just want to thank the   Prime Minister for being here we're   going to be meeting your wife at a very   short period of time and I look very   much forward to that and I want to thank   everybody in the room we're going to   have a tremendous relationship long term   relationship of mutual benefit with   Japan thank you all very much thank you   thank you mr. prime minister yes   certainly   Jago house on here those i must thank   you very much from Sankey edison boom my   name is Takeda I have a question to   president Trump Obama administration   under the rebalance to Asia at the have   emphasized Asia but China is taking   hard-line stance in South China Sea as   well as China Sea and North Korea has   went on her on the missiles and nuclear   development so some countries in Asia   are concerned over commitment of United   States in Asia so against this backdrop   as was mentioned earlier for the Trump   administration for the situations in   Asia how would you respond to the   increasing difficulty here and the   president that you have repeatedly   stated about China are taking on the   other currency foreign exchange policies   which are not the good for the United   States do you think of that eventually   it will change in the future I had a   very very good conversation as most of   you know yesterday with the president of   China it was a very very warm   conversation I think we are on the   process of getting along very well and I   think that will also be very much of a   benefit to Japan so we had a very very   good talk last night and discussed a lot   of subject it was a long talk and we are   working on that as we speak we have   conversations with various   representatives of China I believe that   that will all work out very well for   everybody china japan the united states   and everybody in the region as far as   the currency devaluations I've been   complaining about that for a long time   and I believe that we will all   eventually and probably very much sooner   than a lot of people understand or think   we will be all at a level playing field   because that's the only way it's fair   that's the only way that you can fairly   compete in trade and other things and we   will be on that field and we will all be   working very hard to do great for our   country but it has to be fair and we   will make it fair I think the United   States is going to be an even bigger   player than it is right now by a lot   when it comes to trade a lot of that   will have to do with our tax policy   which you'll be seeing in the   not-too-distant future we'll have an   incentive based policy much more so that   we have right now right now we don't   even know nobody knows what policy we   have but we're going to have a very much   incentive based policy we're working   with Congress working with Paul Ryan   working with Mitch McConnell and I think   people are going to be very very   impressed we're also working very much   and this has a lot to do with business   on health care where we can get great   health care for our country at a much   reduced price both to the people   receiving the health care and to our   country because our country is paying so   much and Obamacare as you know is a   total and complete disaster so we're   going to end up with tremendous health   care at a lower price and I think people   are going to be extremely happy   difficult process but once we get going   and you know tom price was just approved   a few hours ago so we finally have our   secretary and now we get down to the   final strokes again I want to thank   everybody for being here I want to thank   mr. prime minister what an honor what a   great honor it is and let's go to   Florida   [Applause]   [Music]

unique   experience as chief executive of your   prospective States and speaking on   behalf of the President and Vice   President I'm certain we'll be able to   rely on your expertise over the coming   weeks and months as we continue to   follow through on our promises to the   American people this is a big week   President Trump tomorrow will give us   his first address to a joint session of   Congress the president is excited to   speak to members in both parties to   judiciary and the American people about   his vision for our nation that vision   has been demonstrated over the course of   the last five weeks that has seen   president Trump take decisive action on   jobs and our economy national security   health care and a whole host of other   issues you'll hear much more about those   topics and more tomorrow night but   suffice it to say that while president   Trump has many ideas about how he   intends to make America great again   he'll also be relying on all of you to   make that happen it's no secret that our   cabinet has many former governors   included that's a clear indication of   how important the President sees all of   your work in your States in fact it   shows a governor as his running mate   vice president Mike Pence served   Hoosiers in Indiana for four years   during that time   governor Pence has led that state and   saw unemployment cut in half and   significant reforms the health care that   had become a national model as governor   of Indiana vice president pants   increased school funding expanded school   choice and created the first

historic investments in infrastructure   taking off a list of his accomplishments   in just four years you can see why   President Trump asked him to run as his   running mate but in all seriousness I

just wanted a   president who would listen to me right a   president who would work with me who   would respect the important   constitutional responsibilities and roll   that not only the state played but that   I played as a governor this morning let   me assure you you have that in President   Donald Trump   the president recognizes that America's   governors have a unique responsibility   and a unique perspective that will be an   important part of the national debate   now and going forward the president's   viewpoint you are the CEOs of your state   and the CEO is who has become president   of the United States understands that   and he has directed our entire   administration to work with you in   crafting solutions that will improve the   lives the prosperity the security

citizens and you want you know   they want things done but they don't get   things done and it's not your fault   sometimes it's your fault but they   understand that but sometimes it's not   your fault we're going to speed it up   because that's not how a partnership is   supposed to work the government should   not stand in your way in delivering   needed reforms and services and it won't

spoken to some of   you last night about it have many   projects that aren't tired I mean just   literally tied up because of   environmental concerns and it's been in   for years and years and years the   project your state wants great for   employment everybody wants them and they   couldn't get them out of Environmental   Protection and we will get them out now   that doesn't mean they're going to be   approved but it will be rejected quickly   one way or the other there'll be either   rejected quickly are they going to get   approved I would say most will be   approved but you're going to know you're   not going to wait nine years or 11 years   some of the horror stories that I've   heard under my administration we're   going to have a true partnership of   collaboration and cooperation we will   get to the answers and we will get them   quickly and the flexibility you need to   implement the reforms that you are going   to have in order to make decision making   proper and decision making fast so we're   going to do both those things proper and   fast one of the most important   responsibilities for the federal   government is the budget of the United   States my first budget will be submitted   to the Congress next month this budget   will be a public safety and national   security budget very much based on those   two with plenty of other things but very   strong and it will include a historic   increase in defense spending to rebuild   the depleted military of the United   States of America at a time the most   [Applause]   and you'll be hearing about that   tomorrow night in great detail this is a   landmark event a message to the world in   these dangerous times of American   strength security and resolve we must   ensure that our courageous service men   and women have the tools they need to   deter war and when called upon to fight   in our name only do one thing wind we   have to win we have to start winning   wars again have to say when I was young   in high school and college everybody   used to say we never lost a war we never   lost a war you remember some of you are   right there with me and you remember we   never lost a war America never last and   now we never win a war we never win and   we don't fight to win we don't fight   doing so either gotta win or don't fight   it at all but where we are 17 years   almost 17 years of fighting in the   Middle East we're up I said chart the   other day as of about a month ago six   trillion dollars we've spent in the   Middle East six trillion dollars and I   want to tell you that's just   unacceptable and we're nowhere actually   if you think about it we're less than   know where the Middle East is far worse   than it was 16 17 years ago there's not   even a contest so we've spent six   trillion dollars we have a hornet's nest   it's a mess like you've never seen   before we're nowhere so we're going to   straighten it out this defense spending   increase will be offset and paid for by   finding greater savings and efficiencies   across the federal government we're   going to do more with less I got   involved in an airplane contract I got   involved in some other contracts and we   cut the hell out of the prices i mean we   saved a lot of money tremendous amount   of money beyond anything that the   generals that were involved they said   they've never seen anything like before   11   complain on a small order of one plane I   saved 725 million dollars and i would   say i devoted about if I edited up all   of calls probably about an hour so I   think that might be my highest and best   use because if we can do that our budget   will be nothing my harvest and there are   many other places it's all the same and   in one way that's a good thing because   we have an answer and David is going to   do a fantastic job at the VSA david is   sitting there shaking his head stand up   [Applause]   so we can't get our people through   cabinet but he went through was it 95 to   nothing how the hell did you do that boy   oh boy he must be good you were the one   100 20 well chose you hey we can do it   but we do we have still quite a few   cabinet members and they're just in   limbo waiting waiting it's like   obstruction it's obstruction and but   eventually we'll get them and they'll   put their people in and we'll get those   agencies etc to work we're going to do   more with less and make the government   lean and accountable to the people we   can do so much more with the money we   spend with the 20 trillion dollars in   debt can you imagine that the government   must learn to tighten its belt something   families all across the country have had   to learn to do unfortunately but they've   had to learn to do and they've done it   well my budget increases spending and   the increase in all spending for federal   law enforcement also and activities   having to do with law enforcement will   be substantially increased and we will   fight violent crime you look at what's   happening in our cities you look at   what's happening in Chicago what's going   on in Chicago we will fight violent   crime and we will win and we'll win that   one fairly quickly once we give the   local police local law enforcement the   right to go in and fight it and we back   them monetarily and also otherwise we're   going to win that one we're going to win   it fairly quickly I believe   my budget also puts America first by   keeping tax dollars in America to help   veterans and first responders so   important this budget follows through   and my promise to focus on keeping   Americans safe keeping out terrorists   keeping out criminals and putting   violent offenders behind bars or   removing them from our country   altogether and i must say that we've   been treated very well very very well on   the job the general kelly is done at the   border it's tough it's strong I was   talking last night to Terry McAuliffe   and he said you have to mention this   because he met with where is Terry there   around here someplace Terry and he met   with general kelly and i think i can say   you were impressed with general kelly   and he said you have to get the point   out that they're removing the bad ones   and that's where our focus is it's the   bad ones we're getting some very very   bad players out of this country drug   lords gang members heads of gangs   killers murderers we're getting them out   that's what we're focused on the presses   and covering that unfortunately but it's   something that is very important we're   getting the bad ones out and that's   always where I said I was going to start   I was going to start with these bad   players and they are bad they are rough   and tough and we're getting in the hell   out of our country and we're bringing   them to where they started out let their   country do what they have to do with   them so the budget which is going to be   a very big part of tomorrow night's   speech is going to be I think a budget   of great rationality but it's going to   have to do with military safety economic   development and things such as that   great detail tomorrow night we're also   going to do whatever we can to restore   the authority of the states when that is   the appropriate thing to do we're going   to give you back a lot of the powers   that have been taken away from States   and great people and great governors and   you can control it better than the   federal government because you're right   on top   you have something that's controllable   so I think that's going to be very   important you see that already taken   effect we have to let the state's   compete and to see who has the best   solutions they know the best how to   spend their dollars and how to take care   of the people within each state and   states are different and people are   different so the governor's are going to   have a lot more decision-making ability   than they have right now all states will   benefit from our economic agenda we will   reduce taxes very very substantially and   simplify the tax code we're also going   to make taxes between countries much   more fair we're one of the only   countries in the world that can people   can sell their product into US and have   no texts no nothing and they get rich   and yet if you want to do business with   them you'll have taxes I've seen as high   as a hundred percent so they sell in to   us no problem we sell into them because   we don't sell in because the tax is so   high that they don't want us to sell it   to them so I know that's always been a   point of contention but to me it's just   fair it's just fair its reciprocal it's   fair and so we're going to be doing a   lot of work on that and that's becoming   a very very important factor fairness   because I believe in free trade I want   so much trade you know somebody said oh   maybe he's a total nationalist which I   am in a true sense but I want trade I   want great trade between countries but   the word free is very deceiving because   it's good for them it's not good for us   I want fair trade and if we're going to   be taxed they should be taxed at the   same amount the other countries and one   of two things is going to happen we're   going to make a lot of money or the   other countries going to get rid of its   text and that's good too because now the   product like harley-davidson I was   talking to them the product will now   flow into other countries where right   now they can't do so we're going to make   it easier for states to invest in   infrastructure and I'm going to have a   big statement tomorrow night on   infrastructure we spend six trillion in   the Middle East   and we have potholes all over our   highways and our roads I have a friend   who's in the trucking business he said   my trucks are destroyed going from New   York to Los Angeles they destroyed he   said I'm not going to get the good   trucks anyway always prided himself on   buying the best equipment he said the   roads are so bad that by the time we   make the journey from new york to los   angeles or back he said the equipment is   just beat to hell i said when has it   been like that before he said it's never   been in the business for 40 years he   said it's never been like that 40 years   never been like that so we're going to   take care of that infrastructure we're   going to start spending on   infrastructure big and not like we have   a choice it's not like oh gee let's hold   it off our highways our bridges are   unsafe are tunnels I mean we have   tunnels in New York where the tiles are   on the ceiling and you see many tiles   missing and you wonder you know you're   driving 40 miles an hour 50 miles an   hour through a tunnel take a look at the   lincoln tunnel in the Queens Midtown   Tunnel and you're driving and you see   all this loose material that's heavy you   know it was made many years ago so it's   heavy today it's light used to be better   the problem is you got to hold it up and   I said to myself every time I Drive   through I say I wonder how many people   are hurt or injured when they're driving   at 40 50 miles an hour through a tunnel   and a tile falls off and there's so many   missing tiles and such loose concrete so   we have to fix our infrastructure it's   not like we have a choice we have no   choice and we're going to do it and it   also happens to mean jobs which is a   good thing we're going to repeal and   replace Obamacare and get States the   flexibility that they need to make the   end result really weird for them very   complicated issue we have Tom Price just   got confirmed sitting here   shit   [Applause]   and I spent a lot of time with Governor   Walker and Governor Rick Scott the other   day we're talking about it they're   really very expert on the subject and I   want to thank them they spent a lot of   time with me Governor Christie who's   here someplace where is Chris Governor   Christie thank you and so we have a lot   of we have a lot of talent at a lot of   expertise here I will tell you and we   have come up with a solution that's   really really I think very good now I   have to tell you it's an unbelievably   complex subject nobody knew that health   care could be so complicated and   statutorily and for budget purposes as   you know we have to do health care   before we do the tax cut the tax cut is   going to be major it's going to be   simple and the whole tax plan is   wonderful but I can't do it until we do   health care because we have to know what   the health care is going to cost and   statutorily that's the way it is so for   those people that say oh gee I wish we   could do you know the tax versus it just   doesn't work that way I would like to do   that for us it's actually tax-cutting   has never been that easy but it's a tiny   little ant compared to what we're   talking about with Obamacare and you   have to remember it I say this to   Democrats in the room of which we have   many Obamacare has failed if you go to   Minnesota where they had a sixty-six   percent increase and the governor of   Minnesota who's with us today said   Obamacare the Affordable Care Act is no   longer affordable something to that   effect I think that might be at exactly   but the Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable Obamacare has failed I say to   the Republicans if you really want to do   politically something good don't do   anything sit back for a period of two   years because 17 is going to be a   disaster a disaster for Obamacare if we   don't do something let it be a disaster   because we can blame that on the dems   that are in our room and we can blame   that on the Democrats and President   Obama let it implode and then let it   upload an 18 even worse don't do   anything and they will come   begging for us to do something but   that's not the fair thing to do for the   people not the fair thing politically I   think it would be a great solution   because as soon as we touch it if we do   the most money new thing just a tiny   little change what's going to happen   they're going to say it's the   Republicans problem that's the way it is   but we have to do what's right because   Obamacare is a failed disaster and it's   interesting it's sort of like when you   see it you see it with politicians you   see with President Obama when you know   he's getting out of office and the clock   is ticking and he's not going to be   there his approval rating goes way up   even though you know not that active in   the last period of time the approval   rating goes up that's not him that's   like almost everybody I see it happening   with Obamacare people hate it but now   they see that the end is coming and they   said oh maybe we love it there's nothing   to love it's a disaster folks okay so   you have to remember that and very   importantly we are going to work to   restore local control to our nation's   education system Betsy's here someplace   and she is going to be I think fantastic   I think she's going to be   [Applause]   lets you feel so strongly and she's had   such support from so many people you   know you don't see that too much because   you see the anti you never see the   positive but i can tell you I've had so   many calls while she was going through   that horrible process I was a tough   tough nasty process and she hung and she   was strong as you get but so many people   were calling Betsy's saying you will do   such a fantastic job once you get it   it's like sometimes I'd say it's much   tougher to get into Harvard than it is   to stay there does that make sense it's   tougher to get into the Wharton School   of Finance you can't get in but if you   get in it's fine you get through right I   think you're going to do a fantastic job   and we're very proud of you and you took   a lot of heat but you're going to do   great so she wants to bring   decision-making powers back to parents   back to the families and back to the   states where they can really control   education and just finally I'm looking   forward to working with you in these   projects and so much more we're going to   do these projects and so many more and I   thank you all again for being here it's   going to be a wood so much more we're   going to do these projects and so many   more and I thank you all again for being   here it's going to be a really   productive discussion so productive that   I'm going to ask the press to start   leaving because I wouldn't want them to   see any great productive session but   then again thank you   complexion   [Applause]   you

wonderful   introduction so true so true I said to   the agent I'm sorry the only thing wrong   I actually got on the phone fired of   myself because he said you don't want to   do it it'll never work

do this that's   what I really said but we had tremendous   success on the apprentice and when I ran   for president I had to leave the show   that's when I knew for sure I was doing   it and they hired a big big movie star   Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place   and we know how that turned out the   ratings went right down the tubes it's   been a total disaster and Mark will   never ever

I rate him a   12 okay so I want to thank you thank you   very much appreciate but most   importantly today I want to thank the   American people your faith and prayers   have sustained me and inspired me   through some very very tough times all   around America i have met amazing people   whose words of worship and encouragement   have been a constant source of strength   what I hear most often as I travel the   country or five words that never ever   fail to touch my heart that's I am   praying for you I hear it so often I am   praying for you mr. president   no one has inspired me more my travels   than the families of the United States   military men and women who have put   their lives on the line every day for   their country and their countrymen I   just came back yesterday from Dover Air   Force Base to join the family of Chief   William ryan owens as america's fallen   hero was returned home very very sad but   very very beautiful very very beautiful   his family was their incredible family   loved him so much so devastated he was   so devastated but the ceremony was   amazing he died in defense of our nation   he gave His life in defense of our   people our debt to him and our debt to   his family is eternal and everlasting   greater love hath no man than this that   a man lay down his life for his friends   we will never forget the men and women   who wear the uniform believe me   ok   from generation to generation their   vigilance has kept our Liberty alive our   freedom is one by their sacrifice and   our security has been earned with their   sweat and blood and tears God has   blessed this land to give us such   incredible heroes and Patriots they are   very very special and we are going to   take care of them   our soldiers understand that what   matters is not party or ideology or   creed but the bonds of loyalty that link   us all together as one America is a   nation of believers in towns all across   our land it's plain to see what we   easily forget so easily we forget this   that the quality of our lives is not   defined by our material success but by   our spiritual success I will tell you   that and I tell you that from somebody   that has had material success and knows   tremendous numbers of people with great   material success the most material   success many of those people are very   very miserable unhappy people and I know   a lot of people without that but they   have great families they have great   faith they don't have money at least not   nearly to the extent and they're happy   those to me are the successful people I   have to tell you   I was blessed to be raised in a church   home my mother and father taught me that   to whom much is given much is expected I   was sworn in on the very Bible from   which my mother would teach us as young   children and that faith lives on in my   heart every single day the people in   this room come from many many   backgrounds you represent so many   religions and so many views but we are   all united by our faith in our Creator   and our firm knowledge that we are all   equal in his eyes we are not just flesh   and bone and blood we are human beings   with Souls our republic was formed on   the basis that freedom is not a gift   from government but that freedom is a   gift from God   it was the great Thomas Jefferson who   said the God who gave us life gave us   Liberty Jefferson asked can the   liberties of a nation be secure when we   have removed a conviction that these   liberties are the gift of God among   those freedoms is the right to worship   according to our own beliefs that is why   I will get rid of and totally destroy   the Johnson Amendment and allow our   representatives of faith to speak freely   and without fear of retribution I will   do that remember   freedom of religion is a sacred right   but it also right under threat all   around us and the world is under serious   serious threat in so many different ways   and I've never seen it so much and so   openly as since I took the position of   president the world is in trouble but   we're going to straighten it out okay   that's what i do i fix things we're   going to straighten it out believe me   when you hear about the tough phone   calls i'm having don't worry about it   just don't worry about it they're tough   we have to be tough it's time we're   going to be a little tough folks would   take an advantage of by every nation in   the world virtually it's not going to   happen anymore it's not going to happen   anymore we have seen unimaginable   violence carried out in the name of   religion acts of wanton slaughter   against religious minorities horrors at   a scale that defy description terrorism   is a fundamental threat to religious   freedom it must be stopped and it will   be stopped may not be pretty for a   little while it will be stopped we have   seen   and by the way general as you know James   Mad Dog shouldn't said in this room   maddis now there's a reason they call   him mad dog madness never lost a battle   always wins him and always wins them   fast he's our new Secretary of Defense   will be working with Rex he's right now   in South Korea going to Japan go in some   other spots I'll tell you what I've   gotten to know him really well he's the   real deal we have somebody who's the   real deal working for us and that's what   we need so you watch you just watch   things will be different we have seen   peace-loving Muslims brutalized   victimized murdered and oppressed by   Isis killers we have seen threats of   extermination against the Jewish people   we have seen a campaign of Isis and   genocide against Christians where they   cut off heads not since the Middle Ages   have we seen that we haven't seen that   the cutting off of hats now they cut off   the heads they drown people in steel   cages haven't seen this I haven't seen   this nobody's seen this for many many   years all nations have a moral   obligation to speak out against such   violence all nations have a duty to work   together to confront it and to confront   it viciously if we have to so I want to   express clearly today to the American   people that my administration will do   everything in its power to defend and   protect religious liberty in our land   America must forever remain a tolerant   society we're all face or respected and   we're all of our citizens can feel safe   and secure we have to feel safe and   secure in recent days we have begun to   take necessary action to achieve that   goal our nation has   the most generous immigration system in   the world but these are those and there   are those that would exploit that   generosity to undermine the values that   we hold so dear we need security there   are those who would seek to enter our   country for the purpose of spreading   violence or pressing other people based   upon their faith or their lifestyle not   right we will not allow a beachhead of   intolerance to spread in our nation you   look all over the world and you see   what's happening so in the coming days   we will develop a system to help ensure   that those admitted into our country   fully embrace our values of religious   and personal liberty and that they   reject any form of oppression and   discrimination we want people to come   into our nation but we want people to   love us and to love our values not to   hate us and to hate our values we will   be a safe country we will be a free   country and we will be a country where   all citizens can practice their beliefs   without fear of hostility or fear of   violence America will flourish as long   as our Liberty and in particular our   religious liberty is allowed to flourish   America will succeed as long as our most   vulnerable citizens and we have some   that are so vulnerable have a path to   success and America will thrive as long   as we continue to have faith in each   other and faith in God that faith in God   has inspired men and women to sacrifice   for the needy to deploy tours overseas   and to lock arms at home to ensure equal   rights for every man woman and child in   our land it's that faith that sent the   pilgrims across the oceans the pioneers   across the plains and the young people   all across America to chase their dreams   they are chasing their dreams we are   going to bring those dreams back as long   as we have God we are never ever alone   whether it's the soldier on the Night   Watch with a single parent on the night   shift God will always give us solace and   strength and comfort we need to carry on   and to keep carrying on for us here in   Washington we must never ever stop   asking God for the wisdom to serve the   public according to his will that's why   thank you   that's why President Eisenhower and   senator Carlson had the wisdom to gather   together 64 years ago to begin this   truly great tradition but that's not all   they did together let me tell you the   rest of the story just one year later   senator Carlson was among the members of   Congress to send to the President's desk   a joint resolution that added under God   to our Pledge of Allegiance it's a great   thing because that's what we are and   that is what we will always be and that   is what our people want one beautiful   nation under God thank you god bless you   and God bless america thank you very   much thank you thank you   [Applause]   mr. president we are coming near the end   of his prayer breakfast the presence of   the Divine Spirit in this room with us   resting on each heart and radiating   outwards reinforces for me what   scripture insists is one of our most   basic obligations to love our neighbor   as ourself we are all children of God   each of us created in His image and   though we might have different images as   we look out at each other today it is in   that spirit of prayer and love for all   of us that we have gathered rabbi looks   teen thank you for sharing with us this   morning the words of Solomon from Torah   that we must continue to proclaim   Liberty for all of God's children and to   congressman Vargas and out and hold   thank you for your prayers for the poor   and for justice and your reminder that   we should pray for those in leadership   in our republic Thank You Bard maillard   and mercy me for sharing about your   father and sharing about how your life   has been transformed through prayer and   in song helping us to imagine what our   eyes will see when his face is before us   and when his glory surrounds us and   thank you for reminding us that God's   love can transform us Thank You chaplain   black for your service and for your   spirit and for reminding us that with   prayer all things are possible from   healing our nation's divisions and our   difficult racial history to making our   voices heard in heaven as long as we   pray with that earnest need you have not   just an appointed position chaplain but   an anointed position   and to my partner and friend senator   Bozeman thank you it's been a wonderful   journey together and mr. president thank   you for joining us this morning and for   keeping this tradition one that really   does matter in which every president has   joined this breakfast as we humble   ourselves and pray for our nation for   wisdom and for hope as I said in the   opening the weekly Senate prayer   breakfasts the house prayer breakfast   the parliamentary prayer breakfast   around the world are opportunities for   us to come together with those who are   our opponents those with whom we fight   and struggle in the daily work of   politics we gather we humble ourselves   and we see God's face I grew up in a   small Church in Delaware and there was a   men's prayer group in that church that   church did bold things it welcomed   refugees it fed the hungry and homeless   but one Sunday morning a visiting pastor   asked if anyone had ever tried to make   real the challenge of Isaiah 61 and   other challenges from our old testament   that said to visit the widow and the   orphan to visit those in prison to feed   the hungry and to welcome the stranger   and he said I'm going to the prison here   in Delaware in Smyrna to visit with   prisoners will anyone come with me this   was a suburban Republican Presbyterian   congregation we did everything decently   and in order and a few men surprised   themselves by finding their arms raised   and then went to this place to visit   with people quite different from   themselves and to feel the spirit moved   them to challenge them to be brothers   with people who had lived very different   lives one of those men became close   friends with a convicted murderer named   Paul one of those men welcomed that man   Paul into his home where he was raising   three young boys and took a great risk   because of the power of that prayer   group   that man is my father it is amazing what   prayer can challenge us to do and so mr.   president we shared a solemn and very   difficult moment yesterday as you came   to my home state of Delaware we traveled   together along with many leaders of our   military and members of Congress but as   we gathered with the family of a Navy   SEAL ryan owens to comfort his widow his   young children his parents and his   family and as we marched and assembled   and prayed at the very edge of his   flag-draped coffin i could see the   weight of your office upon your   shoulders and so with the same courage   my father had in his prayer group i   might ask if you'd just come stand with   me and john if you'd stand alongside him   and if you all please would bow your   heads as we pray for a moment as Solomon   did as David did Heavenly Father we ask   that you would give our president your   wisdom that you would open our hearts   and his heart that you would give us a   heart for all your children a heart of   humility and grace amen   and now for a closing moving song Bart   milord and mercy me   [Applause]   I think there's power when the body of   Christ lifts up the name of Jesus and to   see a room full of people like this just   to hear you sing gonna be amazing and so   if you don't know the words this song   you probably need to go to church more   some of you like please let me know the   words please look in other words Amazing   Grace house   [Music]   [Music]   I   I   [Music]   there's got to be more then going back   and forth doing a rat doing wrong we   would Tom that's   you   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   God   No   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   to offer our closing prayer a key member   of our Senate breakfast group because   she teaches us how to like each other   senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota thank   you so much thank you to Mercy me for   that beautiful music thank you to the   two senators up here with me did such a   wonderful job planning this breakfast   our representatives thank you to the   president I do have a message for you to   pass on to the first lady something very   big happened a few weeks ago she   officially displaced me as the most   famous Slovenian American in Washington   DC she was actually born an hour away   from my relatives and every time I look   at her it's like looking in the mirror   I do need to also thank the vice   president for being here all of these   distinguished guests and I'd want to   state the obvious here regardless of   political party all of us in Washington   in fact around the world were truly   stunned by what happened this fall yes   none of us would ever have imagined that   a Chicago cub would be wearing a World   Series ring Ben I just wish you would   have been playing for the Minnesota   Twins now over the years so many have   led us in prayer and reflection in this   breakfast rabbis any moms priests and   pastors mother Teresa Raj Shah and even   bono and here's what we've learned   across religions like across our nation   there really is more that unites us than   divides us in the words of the uniquely   American poet Walt Whitman i hear   america singing the varied carols I here   for Whitman these were the songs of   mechanics carpenters masons and   shoemakers for us gathered today we hear   the varied carols of our American   religious traditions a chorus of many   faiths as we conclude our time together   let us lift up our faith in God yes and   also our faith in one big country a   country filled with big hearts and big   dreams a country that is big enough for   all people to worship and live let us   pray   God thank you for gathering us here   today at the center of our American   experiment is American faith we pledge   to be one nation under God indivisible   we strive to be more perfect endowed by   you our Creator we possess certain   unalienable rights may our nation's   leaders be steadfast in their defense of   those rights searching not just for   common ground but higher ground may we   deepen our understanding of one another   and our faith in one another at the same   time may we recognize that conviction   without courage isn't enough that faith   without good works isn't enough and that   our work is to stand with those who need   us most it was you Lord who called on us   to feed the hungry clothe the naked   visit the imprisoned look after the sick   and welcome the stranger in our pursuit   of liberty and justice for all let us   stamp out intolerance for we know the   importance of being a part of something   bigger than ourselves in believing in   something bigger than ourselves and with   that faith we will always hear america   singing in your name we pray amen   [Applause]   get organized here   the time has come for the president to   leave us we want you to know how honored   we are for you being here and making it   such that with your enthusiastic   participation you've continued an   unbroken tradition dating back to   President Eisenhower we promised you   pray for you mr. president for God's   wisdom to light your path ladies and   gentlemen please remain in your seats as   the president the parts thank   [Applause]   [Applause]   you   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you   [Music]

just shortly here I just had the   privilege walking through this factory   with him we talked to a few of our   people watch the airplanes being built   now i'll say i think he was I think he   was impressed with what he saw I'll let   him provide his own his own   characterization of that when he comes   up but we have amazing work going on   here and a airplane rollout event is a   historic inspiring event this is the   first 787 dash ten built right here in   Charleston an incredible airplane that's   going to change the world for our   customers and when we roll out a new   airplane we remember all the investments   that have gone into this this area here   seven years ago with swampland today   today after two billion dollars of   investment and partnership here in the   community this is a modern aerospace   facility building the highest technology   airplanes in the world and we've added   thousands and thousands of jobs over   that time period   [Applause]   this is about manufacturing in the u.s.   going forward Boeing's going to be   spending another six billion dollars of   Rd and capital in the United States this   year investing in innovation the new   paint hanger here at Charleston is just   another example of that and going   forward mr. president our commitment to   you and to our country is that we're   going to continue to build dreams we're   going to continue to grow and sustain   jobs here in the US and we're going to   continue to bring innovation bring new   innovation to our customers that allows   them to connect protect explore and

thank you dennis and i have to say i   love South Carolina I love it   remember we came down altogether we came   down and this was going to be a place   that was tough to win and we won in a   landslide this was a good one so I want   to thank I want to thank the people of   South Carolina and your governor   tremendous guy he supported us right   from the beginning so I'd like to thank   Governor McMaster for the credible job   he's right here someplace thank you very   much you have been fantastic and i have   to say also that is one beautiful   airplane   [Applause]   congratulations to the men and women   here who have built it what an amazing   piece of art what an amazing piece of   work Thank You Dennis for the invitation   to be with you today you know the old   days when i made this speech i get paid   a lot of money now i have to do it for   nothing so   not a good deal but that's okay we love   it it's wonderful to be back in South   Carolina especially with your new   governor where is Henry he's around here   someplace where is he stand up Henry   proud of you he helped us so much and I   want to also thank your former Governor   nikki Haley who's doing an awfully good   job for us she's representing America   very well as our ambassador to the   United Nations she is doing a   spectacular job it's early but she has   just been really great we're here today   to celebrate American engineering and   American manufacturing we're also here   today to celebrate jobs jobs   this plane as you know was built right   here in the great state of South   Carolina our goal is a nation must be to   rely less on imports and mourn products   made here in the USA right here in the   USA it's amazing to think that a little   over one hundred and thirteen years ago   next door in North Carolina Orville   Wright was the first man to sail the   skies in a very little airplane the 1903   wright flyer was made of mostly wood and   cloth it was so small that Orville's   brother Wilbur could not join him on the   flight it was always very upset about   that the flight lasted all of 12 seconds   but it was incredible that flight was a   testament to the American spirit I see   that same spirit everywhere I travel in   the country I saw that spirit all   throughout the campaign we have the   greatest people anywhere in the world we   have the greatest spirit and you just   look at what's going on today in our   country you look at what's happening   with jobs you look at what's happening   with plants moving back into our country   all of a sudden they're coming back and   they're going to be very happy about it   believe me they're going to be very very   happy   as your president I'm going to do   everything I can to unleash the power of   the American spirit and to put our great   people back to work   [Applause]   this is our match by American and hire   American we want products made in   America made by American hands you   probably saw the Keystone pipeline I   approved recently and the Dakota and i'm   getting ready to sign the bill i said   where is the pipe made and they told me   not here I said that's good at a little   sentence that you have to buy American   steel and you know what that's the way   it is it's the way it's going to be   we're going to fight for every last   American job we've come a long way since   the Wright brothers and their first   flight more than a century ago your   plane is made of carbon fiber it seats   330 passengers it's 18 feet longer than   the previous version of the 787 and this   aeroplane can fly for half a day before   it touches the ground the name says it   all Dreamliner great name our country is   all about making dreams come true over   the last number of years that hasn't   been necessarily the case but we're   gonna make it the case again   [Applause]   that's what we do in America we dream of   things and then we build them we turn   vision into reality and we will be doing   a lot more of that believe me in the   months and years to come I also want to   say a word to all of the members of the   armed forces who are here with us today   in this record crowd South Carolina has   a long very very proud military   tradition and history we salute all   South Carolina military families and we   salute all the men and women who wear   the uniform   [Applause]   we are going to fully rebuild our   military by the way you care if we use   the f-18 Super Hornets what you only   care about what do you think well   thought that was the Super Hornet we are   looking seriously at a big order and   we'll see how that you know the problem   is that dennis is a very very tough   negotiator but I think we may get there   we're also working in the Air Force One   project which was a difficult project   for previous administrations but it   looks like we're getting closer and   closer and we're going to ensure   [Applause]   [Music]   that our great service members have the   tools equipment training and resources   they need to get the job done as George   Washington said being prepared for war   is the best way to prevent it and that's   really what it is best way to prevent   war being prepared peace through   strength we build a military might so   great and we are going to do that that   none will dare to challenge it none   we will ensure our men and women in   uniform have the latest the most   cutting-edge systems in their arsenal   right now it's not that way it will be   that way very very soon believe me you   will be an important player in this   effort boeing has built many important   aircraft including as i said the f-18   Super Hornet the f-15 strike eagle and   the Apache helicopter just to name a few   and I'm big very very serious the new   Air Force one that plane as beautiful as   it looks is 30 years old can you believe   it what can look so beautiful at 30 an   aeroplane   I don't know which one do we like better   folks tell me   [Applause]   on every front we are going to work for   the American people know we're in our   focus is and I mean this so strongly and   our focus has to be so strong but my   focus has been all about jobs and jobs   is one of the primary reasons I'm   standing here today as your president   and I will never ever disappoint you   believe me I will not disappoint you I   campaigned in the promise that I will do   everything in my power to bring those   jobs back into America we wanted to make   much easier has to be much easier to   manufacture in our country and much   harder to leave I don't want companies   leaving our country making their product   selling it back no tax no nothing firing   everybody in our country we're not   letting that happen anymore folks   believe me there will be a very   substantial penalty to be paid when they   fire their people and move to another   country make the product and think that   they're going to sell it back over what   will soon be a very very strong border   going to be a lot different it's going   to be a lot different   already American industry is roaring   back and believe me if we not me I'm a   messenger if we didn't have this victory   we wouldn't be even talking about it to   achieve that gold we're going to   massively reduce job crushing   regulations already started you've seen   that that send our jobs to those other   countries we are going to lower taxes on   American business so it's cheaper and   easier to produce product and beautiful   things like aeroplanes right here in   America we are going to enforce very   strongly enforce our trade rules and   stop fahren cheating tremendous cheating   tremendous cheating we want products   made by our workers in our factory   stamped with those four Magnificent   words made in the USA   [Applause]   [Music]   since November jobs have already begun   to search we're seeing companies open up   factories in America we're seeing them   keep jobs at home Ford General Motors   Fiat Chrysler just to name a very very   few so many more already they're keeping   and bringing thousands of jobs back in   our country because the business climate   they know has already changed in Arizona   intel announced it will open a new plant   that will create 10000 american jobs   they're spending billions of dollars we   will see more and more of that across   the country as we continue to work on   reducing regulations cutting taxes   including for the middle class including   for everyone and including for business   and creating a level playing field for   our workers when there is a level   playing field and I've been saying this   for a long time American workers will   always

kNlzWzq4OfI~Trump TV Network~20170315~WATCH: President Trump Leads Roundtable with CEOs and Union Workers (3/15/2017)~3123.0~4.51999998093~88.0~12.0~   thank you it's really wonderful to be   here today with the auto industry   workers and management leaders i'm also   pleased to be joined by two incredible   members of my cabinet Transportation   Secretary Elaine Chao an environmental   protection agency administrator Scott   Pruett they've been doing an amazing job   they've done a lot of work in a very   short period of time we're looking   forward to getting the rest of our   cabinet approved because believe it or   not we don't have it yet I also want to   thank senator senator we have two great   senators from a great state Tennessee   we're going to be heading out there very   soon right Bob thank you thank you very   much appreciate you being here you want   to take some of this business back with   you I think's right but they're doing   big expansions in Michigan that's what   I've been promising and I guess maybe   it's one of the reasons I won the state   of Michigan much to the surprise of a   lot of people because it's been many   many years but I also want to thank Mary   Barra on my right who really has been   steer leading it and doing a great job   with General Motors we're going to   create 900 brand new jobs I was just   announced and that's going to be peanuts   compared to the kind of numbers we're   going to be seeing in the near future I   believe Mary is going to get on board   and really build new plants in Michigan   and other states in the United States   and it's going to be thousands and   thousands of workers and I want to thank   you very much because you really have   been spearheading my first week in   office some of the executives came to   the White House became friendly with   mark where's mark where's mark city and   &amp; bill bill ford and it's been really   great mark and i appreciate everything   you're doing it's been just super sergio   flew in from Europe he told me it took   him 12 hours I said what kind of a plane   were you flying   we're surge of area but you've been   doing great and he make a great product   and I appreciate it especially when you   make them in the United States side so   thank you and so the Obama   administration eleventh-hour executive   actions were going back and they really   did go back in a promise and it would   have I think destroyed or further   destroyed the automobile industry the   prior administration promise to listen   to industry leaders like you about any   concern you had with the current fuel   efficiency standards during a so-called   midterm review in 2016 2018 then the   days went by and before my inauguration   they did away with a midterm review is   that a correct statement marry you don't   want to get too involved politically but   is that a correct statement they did   away with it can I ask you mark is that   a correct standard that never happened   were you miss represen ice w   misrepresented too okay imposing painful   new restrictions on the american   automobile production lines and   undermining our ability to compete with   other countries and other places   throughout the world which are very very   competitive believe me especially when   it comes to making cars today I'm here   to make right on what you were promised   we are reinstituting the midterm review   we're going to reinstitute that review   and we're giving you a voice in the   process we're going to do some wonderful   work with you but you have to come back   and you have to give us big numbers in   terms of jobs and I know the unions are   going to treat them very nicely because   Dennis we can't go crazy here you   understand it okay we're going to make   it nice and easy we love the workers we   have to take it nice and easy we got to   let them build remember that then I know   you so well   so I know your competitors and you'll   always be competitive but we're all on   the same side the most important issue   this is to me the most important issue   and that's keeping jobs in America and   creating new jobs in the United States   that's why I'm here today we're going to   create new jobs and many many new jobs   new plans not just an expansion of the   plants new plants modern plans like   you've been building in Mexico like   you've been building in other locations   we want to have new plants built in   Michigan and new plants built in Ohio   and new plants in Pennsylvania and North   Carolina and so many other places and   that's what we're looking for so we're   going to go all out we're lowering your   taxes we're going to remove one   job-killing regulation after another the   regulations have already made a big   impact on the auto business and on most   other businesses and we're far from   being finished we've signed many   executive orders reducing regulations we   are far from finished we think we can   get rid of about seventy-five percent of   the regulations in many cases and have   more security for the worker for the   environment and in safety because safety   is so important so we'll have better   security and that's why I'm very glad   that my head of the Environmental   Protection is here Scott wherever you   are Scott so hello Scott so this is   going to be a new era for American jobs   and job creation and a new era almost   like the beginning for the American   Automobile Manufacturers we're going to   make thousands and thousands and   thousands of additional cars we're going   to make them in the United States we're   going to work with you on regulations   we're going to work with you on taxes   but you've got to work with us on new   plants or new jobs and bringing back our   country to a level that it's never seen   before in terms of automobile production   and if you're going to do that you're   going to see some really wonderful   things happen for yourselves you're in   and for most importantly the people of   Michigan and Ohio and all of the states   that was so good to me and they were   good to me because they were treated   very very unfairly and so I'm just here   today to begin the process and with that   if anybody has any questions would love   to take him go ahead anybody Dennis you   want to ask something it's always tough   when I have the Union guy asked first   that's always dangerous mark but that's   okay go ahead did it well I just you   know I appreciate everything you said I   think that the focus on jobs in United   States so important to us as a country   and as working men and women that's been   created it's not just jobs but it's good   paying jobs and jobs that we can buy   homes and vehicles that we build and   everything else but I do get concerned   about environmental standards and I   agree with you that the 2018 discussion   that we then into and I think it was   2012 and again the scheduler but we have   have a midterm view because the way we   look at it is that we have to deal with   the environment we have to do it in a   responsible way where manufacturers are   not in a situation that they cannot   invest but at the same time BP   environmental interests of our nation   well that's offense one hundred percent   we agree with you we all agree with your   honor this but we want you to make great   colors and if it takes an extra thimble   full of fuel we don't want that to stop   make it and sometimes it's it's a tiny   amount of fuel it's a very small thing   we're talking about and we want you to   make a understand your business very   well I understand mechanics very well I   was always I would have been a very good   I would have been a very good chefs to   it but I would have been a good mechanic   and you know there comes a point at   which you are not making great product   anymore comes a point at which i would   even say people end up buying used cars   because they work better because   restrictions that are put on your new   product and we don't want to be at that   position and you were being forced into   a position where my opinion that was   going to happen so we're going to open   it up and we're going to make it to good   in terms of your workers which you know   years ago you had thousands and   thousands of more workers making   automobiles in this country than you do   today and this isn't just machinery and   robotics you know the basics and we're   going to change that and we want   robotics we want all of that to happen   going to make that too by the way but   what I looked at the numbers I saw   thousands tens of thousands and more   workers many years ago that you have   today and we're going to bring that all   back we're going to bring it back to the   worker Thank you Thank You Dennis mr.   president you know on any given day   we're all fierce competitors and I think   the reason you have 18 OEM as a car   makers sitting around here is because   under your leadership to be able to put   this midterm review back on back on   track which which was what we agreed to   back in 2011 well you want treated   fairly because I wants as many people   and I'm talking about people that are   down the middle they don't care about   anything they just want a certain   fairness and they were involved and you   were not treated you want misrepresent   and I think to your point I just want to   make clear that what we've asked for and   what you've responded to is to reinstate   the review it's not a rejection of what   we agreed to it's to process and so we   really appreciate your leadership and as   always we want to we're absolutely you   know committed to improving fuel economy   for our customers you know less   greenhouse gases at safe for the   environment what we need to make sure   that it's done sensibly to your point in   breaking into account jobs that's right   thank you thank you much good job too   okay yeah i would say echo the comments   i think i owe   up the midterm review we can look at all   the development and technologies that   have been developed in the last five   years and in the way the industry is   changing not only with ride sharing with   higher news so we can actually   accomplish and do the right thing for   the environment do it more effectively   that supports jobs and supports new   technology so I think it is very   beneficial that we have this discussion   and you know find the pathway to do the   right thing and I think we can and you   have to compete with other countries too   and we're going to make you so   competitive that the only ones you can   play we're going to be yourself you're   not going to blend government anymore   because you're not doing well against   certain countries you know I'm so   impressed with the people i'm looking at   toyota looking at TM looking at all   these great car companies that Volvo and   so impressed it's going to look at   rights I'm blessing I'm all you could   grow the car company he probably will   end up doing that in a long time but   maybe none I know he's done a great job   right but I thought we could go around   the table and we could start with our   great senator bob Corker and just   introduce yourself real quickly and   we'll know who's here Bob club say I'm   glad to be with you every time I know   that the Ottoman automobile industry   plays such a huge role as a nation and   I'm glad to see it flourish appears it   is in many places across the country and   honored to be with olives thank you   thank you for being here Thank You mr.   president I'm David genic opolis with   volkswagen group of america I'd like to   thank you and secretary child   administrative through it before   reopening the midterm review we think   there's a real opportunity for   harmonization of standards we do think   it's important to reduce greenhouse gas   emissions protect the environment but   this process is important by itself and   there are some opportunities there for   flexibilities that can help us to comply   and achieve the benefits I also just   want to say that we're proud to be in   Tennessee and to be represented by   senator coburn senator Alexander through   our Factory in Chattanooga we've got   7000 employees there in the country and   3500 there and we'd like to grow our   presence in the US and we look forward   to working with you thank you very much   it'll be a very fair review to thank you   yes sir

  automobile industry I'm going to destroy   my whole life I assume the ups and downs   I think the nation is what's better than   the cars are on one of the industry it's   driving my car the paint's today as good   without the lead content and are used to   high lead content yes and I have heard   the paint's today maybe are not as good   as they used to be because of what's   been done our

 automated technology connected   technology is critical for competitive   in the auto industry we know other   countries are following our lead when   you're going to need a lot of approval   for

great   regulation but it's going to be fair but   it won't be complex it'll be better for   the environment it'll be better for   safety but it will be comfortable and I   think as we look at future

l8eoYRtsP4k~Trump TV Network~20170227~WATCH: President Donald Trump Meets with Health Insurance Executives (2/27/2017)~11915.0~4.64615392685~237.0~23.0~   present   [Music]   we're forgetting Spurs   sit down please   [Music]   you are the big ones you are the biggest   of the big great it's very impressive   thank you feeding we just had a great   meeting with the governor's on the   horrible effects that Obamacare is head   and we're going to change it and   straighten it out and make we have a   plan that's going to be I think   fantastic it will be released very soon   we'll be talking about it tomorrow night   during the speech and I think it's going   to be something special and we'll talk   about it right you know I think we'll   get you on and I think you know like   what you hear again thank you for being   here i want to thank also Secretary Tom   Price was with us and is doing a   phenomenal job on a very complex subject   the subject of health care he's an   advocate for the patients Thomas all   about the patients that's what he wants   he wants to have a great healthcare   system Obamacare has been a disaster and   it's only getting worse last year alone   Obama care premiums increased by double   digits since it has got into effect   premiums are up by almost one hundred   percent in many areas and I think that   this year is going to be really the that   I've always been predicted 17 is going   to be a catastrophic year for Obamacare   for payments and you just take a look at   what's happening in various states like   Arizona i believe it was up a hundred   and sixteen percent it's going to be   worse this year Obamacare forced   providers to limit the plan options they   offered to patients and cause them to   drive prices way up now a third of   United States counties are down to one   insurer and the insurer is a fling you   people know that better than anybody   since Obamacare went into effect nearly   half of the insurer's a step and have   stepped from participating in the   Obamacare exchanges it has gotten so bad   that nearly 20 million Americans have   chosen to pay the penalty or received an   exemption rather than buy insurance   that's something that nobody has ever   heard of a thought could happen and   there   we doing that rather than being forced   to buy insurance we must work together   to save americans from obamacare people   know that and everyone knows that at   this point to create more competition   and to bring down the prices   substantially the chaos that obamacare   has created and for which congressional   democrats and you see that are alone and   responsible for requires swift action i   actually told the republican said if we   did nothing just do nothing for a   two-year period let Obamacare totally   implode which it's doing lay down anyway   that would be from a political   standpoint the best thing we can we   could do just let it implode and then   people will come begging the democrats   will come begging to do something to   help them out of the jam once we start   doing it we sort of inherit the problem   we take over the problem it becomes ours   but it's the right thing to do for the   american people i think allowing this to   go on this disaster to go on as a   mistake so I'm asking secretary price to   work with you to stabilize the insurance   markets and to ensure a smooth   transition to the new plan and the new   plan will be a great plan for the   patience for people and hopefully for   the company's going to be a very   competitive plan and costs will come   down and I think the health care will go   up river a substantial I think people   are going to like it a lot we've taken   the best of everything we can take it's   our hope that Democrats will stop the   obstruction and resistance and that's   what they have in fact I've assigned   resist resist I want to resist   everything including cabinet members   have many cabinet members that haven't   been approved yet people that are   extraordinary all of whom are going to   be approved but they just take forever   it's called obstruct and resist helping   and give them a new phrase because   they're real phrases resist I think I   just gave them another word   shouldn't have done that I'm rid of   branding able to see them now come out   obstruct and resist well at least I can   take credit for it and they work with us   and we are going to hopefully work with   the Democrats because ultimately we're   all people that love this country and we   want to do the right thing including   reforms like expanded health care   savings account state flexibility and   the ability to purchase across state   lines the state lines are so important   for competition everybody's wanted to do   it for years what's not to do so that's   going to be very important I want to   thank you all for being here I want to   know and I want you to know that it's an   honor to do business with you it's a   great honor to have you on the White   House and we look forward to providing   health care that is extraordinary better   than any other country anywhere in the   world

central fact he's been great   good morning everybody and welcome back   to the White House the first lady and I   were very very happy last night to host   you we saw some real talent military   talent musicians who were fantastic and   everybody enjoy I'm very proud to have   so many former governors in my cabinet   vice president pence as you know big   governor from a very great state state i   like very much indiana nikki Haley at   the UN is the key here someplace think   so yes we have Rick Perry is going   before we're trying to get people   approve we can't get them out but rick   is going to do a fantastic job sonny   perdue will be joining the cabinet very   soon terry Branstad will be our   ambassador to China an interesting story   on Terry every time I spoke in Iowa he'd   say please don't say anything bad about   China I said what do you mean what do   you mean he said I like China and we do   a lot of business with China and really   just don't and I said hmm so when it   came time to pick in an ambassador I   called him up I said you like China and   i can tell you china is very very happy   with that choice so we met everybody   right these governor's thank you and   thank you terry these governors have   been bold reformers and their success   shows why we need to make states the   laboratories of democracy once again   many of you have shared past   frustrations with waiting for permission   from federal government and agencies and   I understand that and I've had many   people tell me about it and it's been   catastrophic for so many estates you   know your citizens and you want you know   they want things done but they don't get   things done and it's not your fault   sometimes it's your fault but they   understand that but sometimes it's not   your fault we're going to speed it up   because that's not how a partnership is   supposed to work the government should   not stand in your way in delivering   needed reforms and services and it won't   we're going to move very very quickly   environmentally with Scott and so many   others that are involved in the process   of regulation we are going to be cutting   we're going to be doing the right thing   we're going to be protecting people   environmentally and safety wise but   we're going to be moving it quickly very   quickly   and and I can speaking of that I know   many of you and I've spoken to some of   you last night about it have many   projects that are entire I mean just   literally tied up because of   environmental concerns and it's been in   for years and years and years the   project your state wants great for   employment everybody wants them and they   couldn't get them out of Environmental   Protection and we will get them out now   that doesn't mean they're going to be   approved but it will be rejected quickly   one way or the other they'll be the   rejected quickly are they going to get   approved I would say most will be   approved but you're going to know you're   not going to wait nine years or 11 years   some of the horror stories that I've   heard under my administration we're   going to have a true partnership of   collaboration and cooperation we will   get to the answers and we will get them   quickly and the flexibility you need to   implement the reforms that you are going   to have in order to make decision making   proper and decision making fast so we're   going to do both those things proper and   fast one of the most important   responsibilities for the federal   government is the budget of the United   States my first budget will be submitted   to the Congress next month this budget   will be a public safety and national   security budget very much based on those   two with plenty of other things but very   strong and it will include a historic   increase in defense spending to rebuild   the depleted military of the United   States of America at a time you most   [Applause]   and you'll be hearing about that   tomorrow night in great detail this is a   landmark event a message to the world in   these dangerous times of American   strength security and resolve we must   ensure that our courageous service men   and women have the tools they need to   deter war and when called upon to fight   in our name only do one thing when we   have to win we have to start winning   wars again have to say when I was young   in high school and college everybody   used to say we never lost a war we never   lost a war you remember some of you are   right there with me and you remember we   never lost a war America never last and   now we never win a war we never win and   we don't fight to win we don't fight   doing so either gotta win or don't fight   it at all but where we are 17 years   almost 17 years of fighting in the   Middle East we're up I said chart the   other day as of about a month ago six   trillion dollars we've spent in the   Middle East six trillion dollars and I   want to tell you that's just   unacceptable and we're nowhere actually   if you think about it we're less than   know where the Middle East is far worse   than it was 16 17 years ago there's not   even a contest so we've spent six   trillion dollars we have a hornet's nest   it's a mess like you've never seen   before we're nowhere so we're going to   straighten it out this defense spending   increase will be offset and paid for by   finding greater savings and efficiencies   across the federal government we're   going to do more with less I got   involved in an airplane contract I got   involved in some other contracts and we   cut the hell out of the prices I've been   we saved a lot of money tremendous   amount of money beyond anything that the   generals that were involved they said   they've never seen anything like this   before on one plane on a small order of   one plane I saved 725 million   and i would say i devoted about if I   edited up all of calls probably about an   hour so I think that might be my highest   and best use because if we can do that   our budget will be nothing my eyes and   there are many other places it's all the   same and in one way that's a good thing   because we have an answer David is going   to do a fantastic job at the VSA david   is sitting there sacredness let's stand   up so we can't get our people through   cabinet but he went through was it 95 to   nothing how the hell did you do that boy   oh boy he must be good you were the one   100 20 well chose you hey we can do it   but we do we have still quite a few   cabinet members and they're just in   limbo waiting waiting it's like   obstruction it's obstruction and but   eventually we'll get them and they'll   put their people in and we'll get those   agencies etc to work we're going to do   more with less and make the government   lean and accountable to the people we   can do so much more with the money we   spend with the 20 trillion dollars in   debt can you imagine that the government   must learn to tighten its belt something   families all across the country have had   to learn to do unfortunately but they've   had to learn to do and they've done it   well my budget increases spending and   the increase in all spending for federal   law enforcement also and activities   having to do with law enforcement will   be substantially increased and we will   fight violent crime you look at what's   happening in our cities you look at   what's happening in Chicago what's going   on in Chicago we will fight violent   crime and we will win and we'll win that   one fairly quickly once we give the   local police local law enforcement the   right to go in and fight it and we back   them monetarily and also otherwise we're   going to win that one we're going to win   it fairly quickly I believe my budget   also puts America first   by keeping tax dollars in America to   help veterans and first responders so   important this budget follows through   and my promise to focus on keeping   Americans safe keeping out terrorists   keeping out criminals and putting   violent offenders behind bars or   removing them from our country   altogether and i must say that we've   been treated very well very very well on   the job the general kelly is done at the   border it's tough it's strong I was   talking last night to Terry McAuliffe   and he said you have to mention this   because he met with where is Terry's   around here someplace Terry and he met   with general kelly and i think i can say   you were impressed with general kelly   and he said you have to get the point   out that they're removing the bad ones   and that's where our focus is it's the   bad ones we're getting some very very   bad players out of this country drug   lords gang members heads of gangs   killers murderers we're getting them out   that's what we're focused on the presses   and covering that unfortunately but it's   something that is very important we're   getting the bad ones out and that's   always where I said I was going to start   I was going to start with these bad   players and they are bad they are rough   and tough and we're getting them a hell   out of our country and we're bringing   them to where they started out let their   country do what they have to do with   them so the budget which is going to be   a very big part of tomorrow night's   speech is going to be I think a budget   of great rationality what it's going to   have to do with military safety economic   development and things such as that   great detail tomorrow night we're also   going to do whatever we can to restore   the authority of the states when that is   the appropriate thing to do we're going   to give you back a lot of the powers   that have been taken away from States   and great people and great governors and   you can control it better than the   federal government because you're right   on top of   you have something that's controllable   so I think that's going to be very   important you see that already taken   effect we have to let the state's   compete and to see who has the best   solutions they know the best how to   spend their dollars and how to take care   of the people within each state and   states are different and people are   different so the governor's are going to   have a lot more decision-making ability   than they have right now all states will   benefit from our economic agenda we will   reduce taxes very very substantially and   simplify the tax code we're also going   to make taxes between countries much   more fair we're one of the only   countries in the world that can people   can sell their product into US and have   no tax no nothing and they get rich and   yet if you want to do business with them   you'll have taxes I've seen as high as a   hundred percent so they sell in to us no   problem we sell into them because we   don't sell in because the tax is so high   that they don't want us to sell it to   them so I know that's always been a   point of contention but to me it's just   fair it's just fair its reciprocal it's   fair and so we're going to be doing a   lot of work on that and that's becoming   a very very important factor fairness   because I believe in free trade I want   so much trade you know somebody said oh   maybe he's a total nationalist which I   am in a true sense but I want trade I   want great trade between countries but   the word free is very deceiving because   it's good for them it's not good for us   I want fair trade and if we're going to   be taxed they should be taxed at the   same amount the other countries and one   of two things is going to happen we're   going to make a lot of money or the   other country is going to get rid of its   text and that's good too because now the   product like harley-davidson I was   talking to them the product will now   flow into other countries where right   now they can't do so we're going to make   it easier for states to invest in   infrastructure and I'm going to have a   big statement tomorrow night on   infrastructure   we spent six trillion in the Middle East   and we have potholes all over our   highways and our roads I have a friend   who's in the trucking business he said   my trucks are destroyed going from New   York to Los Angeles they destroyed he   said I'm not going to get the good   trucks anyway he always prided himself   on buying the best equipment he said the   roads are so bad that by the time we   make the journey from new york to los   angeles or back he said the equipment is   just beat to hell i said when has it   been like that before he said it's never   spending the business for 40 years he   said it's never been like that 40 years   never been like that so we're going to   take care of that infrastructure we're   going to start spending on   infrastructure big and not like we have   a choice it's not like oh gee let's hold   it off our highways our bridges are   unsafe our tunnels I mean we have   tunnels in New York where the tiles or   on the ceiling and you see many tiles   missing and you wonder you know you're   driving 40 miles an hour 50 miles an   hour through a tunnel take a look at the   lincoln tunnel in the Queens Midtown   Tunnel and you're driving and you see   all this loose material that's heavy you   know it was made many years ago so it's   heavy today it's light used to be better   the problem is you got to hold it up and   I say to myself every time I Drive   through I say I wonder how many people   are hurt or injured when they're driving   at 40 50 miles an hour through a tunnel   and a tile falls off and there's so many   missing tiles and such loose concrete so   we have to fix our infrastructure it's   not like we have a choice we have no   choice and we're going to do it and it   also happens to mean jobs which is a   good thing we're going to repeal and   replace Obamacare and get States the   flexibility that they need to make the   end result really real for them very   complicated issue we have Tom Price just   got confirmed sitting here   [Applause]   and I spent a lot of time with Governor   Walker and Governor Rick Scott the other   day we're talking about it they're   really very expert on the subject and I   want to thank them they spent a lot of   time with me Governor Christie who's   here someplace where is Chris Governor   Christie thank you and so we have a lot   of we have a lot of talent that a lot of   expertise here I will tell you and we   have come up with a solution that's   really really I think very good now I   have to tell you it's an unbelievably   complex subject nobody knew that health   care could be so complicated and   statutorily and for budget purposes as   you know we have to do health care   before we do the tax cut the tax cut is   going to be major it's going to be   simple and the whole tax plan is   wonderful but I can't do it until we do   health care because we have to know what   the health care is going to cost and   statutorily that's the way it is so for   those people that say oh gee I wish we   could do you know the tax versus it just   doesn't work that way i would like to do   that for us it's actually tax-cutting   has never been that easy but it's a tiny   little ant compared to what we're   talking about with Obamacare and you   have to remember it I say this to   Democrats in the room of which we have   many Obamacare has failed if you go to   Minnesota where they had a sixty-six   percent increase and the governor of   Minnesota who's with us today said   Obamacare the Affordable Care Act is no   longer affordable something to that   effect I think that might be it exactly   but the Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable Obamacare has failed I say to   the Republicans if you really want to do   politically something good don't do   anything sit back for a period of two   years because 17 is going to be a   disaster a disaster for Obamacare if we   don't do something let it be a disaster   because we can blame that on the dems   that are in our room and we can blame   that on the Democrats and President   Obama let it implode and then let it   upload an 18 even worse don't do any   and they will come begging for us to do   something but that's not the fair thing   to do for the people not the fair thing   politically I think it would be a great   solution because as soon as we touch it   if we do the most money new thing just a   tiny little change what's going to   happen they're going to say it's the   Republicans problem that's the way it is   but we have to do what's right because   Obamacare is a failed disaster and it's   interesting it's sort of like when you   see it you see it with politicians you   see with President Obama when you know   he's getting out of office and the clock   is ticking and he's not going to be   there his approval rating goes way up   even though you know not that active in   the last period of time the approval   rating goes up that's not him that's   like almost everybody I see it happening   with Obamacare people hate it but now   they see that the end is coming and they   said oh maybe we love it there's nothing   to love it's a disaster folks okay so   you have to remember that and very   importantly we are going to work to   restore local control to our nation's   education system Betsy's here someplace   and she is going to be I think fantastic   I think she's going   [Applause]   Betsy feel so strongly and she's had   such support from so many people you   know you don't see that too much because   you see the anti you never see the   positive but i can tell you I've had so   many calls while she was going through   that horrible process I was a tough   tough nasty process and she hung and she   was strong as you get but so many people   were calling Betsy saying you will do   such a fantastic job once you get it   it's like sometimes I'd say it's much   tougher to get into Harvard than it is   to stay there does that make sense it's   tougher to get into the Wharton School   of Finance you can't get in but if you   get in it's fine you get through right I   think you're going to do a fantastic job   and we're very proud of you and you took   a lot of heat but you're going to do   great so she wants to bring   decision-making powers back to parents   back to the families and back to the   states where they can really control   education and just finally I'm looking   forward to working with you in these   projects and so much more we're going to   do these projects and so many more and I   thank you all again for being here it's   going to be a route so much more we're   going to do these projects and so many   more and I thank you all again for being   here it's going to be a really   productive discussion so productive that   I'm going to ask the press to start   leaving because I wouldn't want them to   see any great productive session but   there   about it again thank you very much   hopefully everyone else will do this   [Music]   complexion

45th   President of the United States Donald   Trump   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   that kind introduction and for your   tremendous work on behalf of our Second   Amendment thank you very much I want to   also thank Wayne LaPierre for his   unflinching leadership in the fight for   freedom Wayne thank you very much great   I'd also like to congratulate karen   handel   on her incredible fight in georgia six   [Applause]   the election takes place on june 20th   and by the way on primers let's that   have 11 Republicans running for the same   position again it's to nerve shattering   she's totally for the NRA and she's   totally for the second amendment so get   out and vote you know she's running   against someone who's going to raise   your taxes to the sky destroy your   health care and he's for open borders   lots of crime and he's not even able to   vote in the district that he's running   in other than that I think he's doing a   fantastic job right so get out and vote   for Karen also my friend he's become a   friend because there's nobody that does   it like Lee Greenwood Wow Lee's anthem   is the perfect description of the   renewed spirit sweeping across our   country and it really is indeed sweeping   across our country so Lee I know I speak   for everyone in this arena when I say we   are all very proud indeed to be an   American thank you very much Lee   [Applause]   no one was more proud to be American   then the beloved patriot and you know   who I'm talking about   we remember on gatherings like today   your former five-term president the late   Charlton Heston how good was Joel and I   remember to Alton he was out there   fighting when maybe a lot of people   didn't want to be fighting he was out   there for a long time he was a great guy   and it's truly wonderful to be back in   Atlanta and back with my friends at the   NRA you're my friends believe me perhaps   some of you remember the last time we   were all together remember that we had a   big crowd then too so we knew something   was happening but it was in the middle   of a historic political year and in the   middle of a truly historic election what   fun that was November 8th what that a   great evening you remember that even   remember that remember they were saying   we have breaking news Donald Trump has   won the state of Michigan they go   Michigan out of that Donald Trump has   won the state of Wisconsin whoa but   earlier in the evening remember Florida   North Carolina South Carolina   Pennsylvania all the way up we ran up   the East Coast and you know the   Republicans have a tremendous   disadvantage in the electoral college   you know that and tremendous   disadvantage and to run the whole East   Coast and then you go with Iowa and Ohio   and all of the different states it was a   great evening one that a lot of people   will never forget a lot of people   not gonna forget that evening and   remember they said there is no path to   274 months I was hearing that you know   they're trying to suppress the vote so   they keep saying it so people say you   know I really like Trump he loves a   second of them and he loves the NRA I   love him but let's go to the movie cuz   you can't win because they're trying to   suppress the vote but they say I mean a   hundreds of times I heard there is no   you know there's no route they say there   is no route to 270 and we ended up with   three or six so they were right not to   73 us that was some evening big sports   fans said that was the single most   exciting event they've ever seen that   includes Super Bowls and World Series   and boxing matches that was an exciting   evening for all of us and it meant a lot   only one candidate in the general   election came to speak to you and that   candidate is now the President of the   United States standing before you again   [Applause]   I have a feeling that in the next   election you could be swamped with   candidates but you're not going to be   wasting your time you'll have plenty of   those Democrats coming over and you're   going to say no sir no thank you no   ma'am perhaps ma'am   it may be Pocahontas remember that and   she is not big for the NRA that I can   tell you but you came through for me and   I am going to come through for you I was   proud to receive the NRA surliest   endorsement in the history of the   organization and today I am also proud   to be the first sitting president to   address the NRA Leadership Forum since   our wonderful Ronald Reagan in 1983 and   I want to thank each and every one of   you not only for your help   electing true Friends of the Second   Amendment but for everything you do to   defend our flag and our freedom with   your activism you help safeguard the   freedoms of our soldiers who have bled   and died for us on the battlefields and   I know we have many veterans in the   audience today and we want to give them   a big big beautiful round of applause   and like I promised we are doing a   really top job already 99 days but   already with the Veterans Administration   people are seeing a big difference we   are working really hard at the VA and   you're going to see it and you're   already seeing it and it's my honor I've   been telling you we're going to do it   and we're doing it thank you   the NRA protects in our capitols and   legislative houses the freedoms that our   service members have won for us on those   incredible battlefields and it's been a   tough fight against those who would go   so far as to ban private gun ownership   entirely but I am here to deliver you   good news and I can tell you that Wayne   and Chris have been fighting with me   long and hard to make sure that we were   with you today not somebody else with an   empty podium because believe me the   podium would have been empty   they fought long and hard and I think   you folks cannot thank them enough they   were with us all the way right from the   beginning but we have news that you've   been waiting for for a long time   the eight-year assault on your Second   Amendment freedoms has come to a   crashing end   [Applause]   you have a true friend and champion in   the White House no longer will federal   agencies be coming after law-abiding gun   owners no longer will the government be   trying to undermine your rights and your   freedoms as Americans instead we will   work with you by your side we will work   with the NRA to promote responsible gun   ownership to protect our wonderful   hunters and their access to the very   beautiful outdoors you met my son I can   tell you both sons they love the   outdoors frankly I think they love the   outdoors more than they love by a   longshot Fifth Avenue but that's okay   and we want to ensure you of the sacred   right of self-defense for all of our   citizens when I spoke to this forum last   year our nation was still mourning the   loss of a giant a great defender of the   Constitution Justice Antonin Scalia I   promised that if elected I would   nominate a justice who would be faithful   and loyal to the Constitution I even   went one step further and publicly   presented a list of twenty judges from   which I would make my selection and   that's exactly what we did and by the   way I want to thank really heritage and   I want to thank also all of the people   that work to us where's Leo is Leo   around here where is he he's got to be   here he where is he he has been so good   but from and also from heritage Jim   DeMint it's been   amazing I mean those those people have   been fantastic they've been real they've   been real friends the federalists people   where are they are they around here   someplace   they really helped us out I kept my   promise and now with your help our brand   new justice and he is really something   very special   Neel Gorsuch sits on the bench of the   United States Supreme Court for the   first time in the modern political era   we have confirmed a new justice in the   first 100 days the last time that   happened was 136 years ago in 1881 now   we won't get any credit for this but   don't worry about it the credit is in   the audience right the credit is of the   audience all of those people they won't   give us credit but it's been a long time   and we're very honored we've also taken   action to stand up for America's   sportsmen on their very last full day in   office the previous administration   issued an eleventh-hour rule to restrict   the use of lead ammunition on certain   federal lands have you heard about that   folks I'm shocked to hear that you've   all heard about that you've heard about   that on his first day as Secretary of   the Interior   Ryan Zinke eliminated the previous   administration's ammunition ban he's   going to be great   Ryan's going to be great we've also   moved very quickly to restore something   gun owners care about very very much   it's called the rule of law   we have made clear that our   administration will always stand with   the incredible men and women of law   enforcement   in fact countless members of law   enforcement are also members of the NRA   because our police know that responsible   gun ownership saves lives and that the   right of self-defense is essential to   public safety do we all agree with that   our police and Sheriff's also know that   when you ban guns only the criminals   will be armed for too long Washington   has gone after law-abiding gun owners   while making life easier for criminals   drug dealers traffickers and gang   members in mace 13 you know about ms-13   it's not pleasant for them anymore folks   it's not pleasant for them anymore   that's a bad group not pleasant for   ms-13 get them the hell out of here   right get them out we are protecting the   freedoms of law-abiding Americans and we   are going after the criminal gangs and   cartels that prey on our innocent   citizens and we are really going after   them as members of the NRA no well some   of the most important decisions a   president can make our appointments and   I've appointed people who believe in law   order and justice   [Music]   that is why I have selected as your   attorney general number one a really   fine person a really good man a man who   has spent his entire career fighting   crime supporting the police and   defending the Second Amendment for the   first time in a long time you have a pro   Second Amendment tough-on-crime attorney   general and his name is Jeff Sessions an   attorney general sessions is putting our   priorities into action he's going after   the drug dealers who are peddling their   poison all over our streets and   destroying our youth he's going after   the gang members who threaten our   children and he's fully enforcing our   immigration laws in all 50 states and   you know what it's about time heading up   the effort to secure America's borders   is a great military general a man of   action homeland security director John   Kelly secretary Kelly who used to be   general Kelly is following through on my   pledge to protect the borders remove   criminal aliens and stop the drugs from   pouring into our country we've already   seen listen to this no it's never it's   never happened before people can't even   believe it and by the way we will build   the wall no matter how low this number   gets or how hide the stuff don't even   think about it don't even think about it   you know they're trying to use this   number against us because we've done so   unbelievably at the borders already   they're trying to use it against us but   you need that wall to stop the human   trafficking to stop the drugs to stop   the wrong people you need the wall but   listen to this we've already seen a 73%   decrease never happened before in   illegal immigration on the southern   border since my election 73 percent you   see what they're doing right so why do   you need a wall we need a wall we'll   build the wall don't even think about it   don't even think about it don't even   think about it that's an easy one   we're going to build the wall we need   the wall I said to general Kelly how   important is that he said very important   it's that final element we need the wall   and it's a wall in certain areas   obviously we have these massive physical   structures you don't need and we have   certain big rivers at all but we need a   wall and we're going to get that wall   and the world is getting the message   they know that our border is no longer   open to illegal immigration and that if   they try to break in you'll be caught   and you'll be returned to your home   you're not staying any longer   and if you keep coming back illegally   after deportation you will be arrested   prosecuted and you will be put behind   bars otherwise it'll never end   let's also remember that immigration   security is national security we've seen   the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San   Bernardino hundreds of individuals from   other countries have been charged with   terrorism related offenses in the United   States we spend billions and billions of   dollars on security all over the world   but then we allow radical Islamic   terrorists to enter right through our   front door that's not going to happen   anymore it's time to get tough it's time   we finally got smart and yes it's also   time to put America first   [Applause]   and perhaps I see all of those beautiful   red and white hats but we will never   forget our favorite slogan of them all   make America great again right keeping   our communities safe and protecting our   freedoms also requires the cooperation   of our state leaders we have some   incredible pro-second amendment   governor's here at the NRA conference   including governor scott of florida   where's governor scott where is great   guy doing a great job governor bryant of   mississippi what a wonderful place   governor Bryant is here Thank You   governor deal of Georgia and we're also   joined by two people that well one I   loved right from the beginning the other   one I really liked didn't like and now   like a lot again does that make sense   Senator David Perdue he was from the   beginning and Senator Ted Cruz like   dislike like where are they good guys   good guys smart cookies each of these   leaders knows that public officials must   serve under the Constitution not above   it we all took an oath to preserve   protect and defend the Constitution of   the United States and that means   defending the Second Amendment   [Applause]   so let me make a simple promise to   everyone of the freedom-loving Americans   in the audience today as your president   I will never ever infringe on the right   of the people to keep and bear arms   never ever freedom is not a gift from   government freedom is a gift from God it   was this conviction that stirred the   heart of a great American patriot on   that day April 242 years ago it was the   day that Paul Revere spread his   Lexington alarm the famous warning that   the British are coming the British are   coming right you've all heard that right   the British are coming now we have other   people trying to come but believe me   they're not going to be successful that   I could think nothing changes right   folks nothing changes they are not going   to be successful   you'll be serious hurt on them not on us   next came the shot heard round the world   and then a ragtag army of god-fearing   farmers frontiersmen shopkeepers   merchants that stood up to the most   powerful army at that time on earth the   most powerful army on earth but we   sometimes forget what inspired those   everyday farmers and workers in that   great war for independence many years   after the war a young man asked captain   levy Preston aged 91 why he fought   alongside his neighbors at Concord was   it the Stamp Act was it the T tax was it   a   work of philosophy know the old veteran   replied then why he was as young man the   captain said what we meant in going for   those redcoats was this we always had   governed ourselves and we always meant   to govern ourselves captain Preston's   words are a reminder of what this   organization and my administration are   all about the right of a sovereign   people to govern their own affairs and   govern them properly we don't want any   longer to be ruled by the bureaucrats in   Washington or in any other country for   that matter in America we are ruled by   our citizens we are ruled by each and   every one of you but we can't be   complacent these are dangerous times   these are horrible times for certain   obvious reasons but we're going to make   them great times again every day we are   up against those who would take away our   freedoms restrict our liberties and even   those who want to abolish the Second   Amendment we must be vigilant and I know   you are all up to the task since the   first generation of Americans stood   strong at Concord each generation to   follow has answered the call to defend   freedom in their time that is why we are   here today to defend freedom for our   children to defend the liberty of all   Americans and to defend the right of a   free and sovereign people to keep and   bear arms I greatly appreciated your   support on November 8th in what will   hopefully be   one of the most important and positive   elections for the United States of all   time and to the NRA I can proudly say I   will never ever let you down thank you   god bless you god bless our Constitution   and god bless america   thank you very much   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]
MIwNXRQONLs~Trump TV Network~20170518~President Donald Trump full Q&A on Russia collusion and Comey firing - Press Conference 5/18/2017~20851.0~4.44827604294~275.0~44.0~   ladies and gentlemen the President of   the United States and the President of   the Republic of Colombia   thank you very much it is a great   pleasure to welcome president Santos to   the White House Colombia is one of our   closest allies in the hemisphere and   today we reaffirm partnership between   our two great nations President Santos   and I had a very productive meeting and   we will continue to work very closely   together to bring peace safety and   prosperity to the hemisphere   perhaps no area is really more important   in terms of cooperation than our joint   effort to end the terrible drug crimes   that plagued both of our countries   recently we have seen an alarmed and I   mean really a very highly alarmed an   alarming trend last year Colombia cocoa   cultivation and cocaine production   reached a record high which hopefully   will be remedied very quickly by the   president we must confront this   dangerous threat to our societies   together today I affirm the United   States willingness to assist Colombia's   strategy to target and eliminate drug   trafficking networks illicit financings   cocoa cultivation and cocaine production   of which there is far too much the drug   epidemic is poisoning too many American   lives and we're going to stop it many   different ways one of them will be the   wall my administration is committed to   keeping drugs and gangs from pouring   into our country already border   crossings are down more than 73 percent   secretary kelly is with us he's done a   fantastic job thank you very much mr.   secretary and in short we have a   tremendous group of people working with   us in terms of ice the ice patrol and   the Border Patrol agents they've done a   fantastic job and I'd like you to give   them my highest compliments mr.   secretary   and ms-13 likewise a horrible horrible   large group of gangs that have been let   into our country over a fairly short   period of time are being decimated by   the Border Patrol by ice and by our   incredible local police forces and they   are getting out of our country or in   some cases going directly into prisons   throughout our country but they've   literally taken over towns and cities of   the United States they will be gone very   quickly I look forward to working with   President Santos as we target drug   trafficking both the United States and   Colombia have strong law enforcement and   security relationship we've had it and   especially over the last fairly short   period of time together we will continue   to fight the criminal networks   responsible for the deadly drug trade   that our people have a really strong   commitment to getting rid of because   they want a much brighter future   president Santos and I also discussed   the deteriorating situation in Venezuela   and it is really in a very bad state as   you see as we all see through the media   to stable and peaceful Venezuela is in   the best interest of the entire   hemisphere and America stands with all   of the people in our great hemisphere   yearning to be free we will be working   with Colombia and other countries on the   Venezuela problem it is a very very   horrible problem and from a humanitarian   standpoint it is like nothing we've seen   in quite a long time the United States   and Colombia are also strong economic   partners and we will continue to pursue   trade policies that benefit both of our   peoples the nation's common goals   of protecting our citizens expanding   opportunity and confronting the drug   crisis will improve the lives of our   people and many throughout the region so   many people are being so horribly   affected by what's going on in terms of   violence and in terms of drugs who are   going to take care of the situation and   we both agreed to take care of it   strongly and quickly   president Santos it was an honor to meet   with you and your entire group of   representatives very talented people   indeed who have been working with us and   my representatives and I look forward to   many more productive meetings such as   the one we just had I'd like to thank   you very much for being at the White   House being our guest and I'd like to   congratulate you on winning the Nobel   Peace Prize it's a very great   achievement thank you very much mr.   president I want to thank you personally   for this warm and productive visit and   for the strong support Colombia has   received from your administration from   Congress and from the American people   does anybody have any questions I'm   shocked John go ahead thank you   mr. president let's get your reaction to   Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen   Stein's decision to appoint a special   counsel to investigate the Russia   Russian interference in the campaign was   this the right move or is this part of a   witch-hunt well I respect the move but   the entire thing has been a witch-hunt   and there is no collusion between   certainly myself and my campaign but I   can always speak for myself and the   Russians zero I think it divides the   country I think we have a very divided   country because of that and many other   things so I can tell you that we want to   bring this great country of ours   together John and I will also say very   strongly we've had tremendous success   you look at our job numbers you look at   what's going on at the border as we   discussed before you look at what will   be happening you're going to see some   incredible numbers with respect to the   success of general mattis and others   with the ISIS situation the numbers are   staggering how successful they've been   the military has been tomorrow as you   know I'm going to Saudi Arabia going to   Israel going to Rome and we have the g7   we have a lot of great things going on   so I hate to see anything that divides   I'm fine with whatever people want to do   but we have to get back to running this   country really really well we've made   tremendous progress in the last 100 and   some odd days tremendous progress and   you see job numbers you see all of the   production that's starting plants   starting to open again haven't been   opened in years I'm very proud of it   that's what I want to be focused on   because believe me there's no collusion   Russia is fine but whether it's Russia   or anybody else   my total priority believe me is the   United States of America so thank you   very much look at all the Presidents on   president Santos can we say that today   we are setting   new roadmap in the relationship between   Colombia and the United States which are   the concrete commitments you were   talking about the post-conflict time   many funds are needed for that you know   the issue of Venezuela president Trump   many deaths human rights violations   there's plenty to be done as well as a   very very serious problem we haven't   really seen a problem like that I would   say mr. president in decades terms of   the kind of violence that were   witnessing the president was telling me   and I knew that Venezuela was a very   very wealthy country just about the   wealthiest in your neck of the woods and   had tremendous strengths in so many   different ways and now it's it's   poverty-stricken people don't have   enough to eat people have no food   there's great violence and we will do   whatever is necessary and we'll work   together to do whatever is necessary to   help with fixing that and I'm really   talking on a humanitarian level when you   look at the oil reserves that they have   when you look at the potential wealth   that Venezuela has you you sort of have   to wonder why is that happening how is   that possible   but it's been unbelievably poorly run   for a long period of time and hopefully   that will change and they can use those   assets for the good and to take care of   their people because right now what's   happening is really a disgrace to   humanity   and John I think you also had a question   for the president if you'd like to does   he have another one yeah this question   about the commitment Emelia el el   compromiso the commitment on cycling   front side and his administration was   shown through the approval of the budget   but for Columbia means an increase in   the support to fund the post-conflict   era last night we received from a very   important organization the Atlantic   Council a report which includes both   parties presided by a Republican senator   and a Democrat Senator with the roadmap   recommending the governments of the   United States and Colombia to follow   this morning we establish this   entrepreneurial Council United States   Colombia so that the private sector can   also have a voice in that roadmap this   means we are working together on every   front that can be convenient for both   countries we will continue to work   together we have ratified that   commitment today during our conversation   and as I said before we have the best of   relations with the United States we are   strategic allies in the region and we   will continue to be so Thank You mr.   president   president Santos to you you heard   President Trump say that critical to   stopping the flow of drugs into the   United States will be the wall that he   wants to build on the Mexican border do   you agree with him would that wall be a   step of a positive step and step towards   reducing the flow of drugs across the   border I believe that the best way to   fight the drug trafficking is by   collaborating this is not a problem of   Colombia only or a problem of the United   States only it's a world problem and we   have to all work together we declared   the war on drugs 40 years ago the world   declared the war on drugs and it's a war   that has not been won so we must be more   effective and more efficient now we are   doing a very big effort because of the   peace process to have a new strategy   carrot   stick stick by force eradication   we have already eradicated this year   only 15000 hectares which is the whole   volume that we eradicated last year and   we're starting to eradicate to   substitute voluntarily through a program   where the peasants and we have 80000   families already in the program that   they are going to substitute for legal   crops and this is the first time that   this could be done because of the peace   before the conflict did not allow us to   build roads and to give these presents   an alternative now we have so we have to   take advantage of this opportunity and   continue reducing the production of coca   in the meantime we will work together   the US and Colombia with other countries   Central America to fight the other   lengths of the chain the intermediaries   we have destroyed 22000 laboratories in   the Colombian jungle seizing the cocaine   in the transit we have seized record   amount of tons last year and this you   were doing even better than last year so   by working together we can be much more   effective and that is that is the   commitment we just made or ratified this   afternoon and that was a long and very   diplomatic answer to your question I   will say it a little bit shorter walls   work just ask Israel they work believe   me they work and we have no choice Peter   Baker yes Thank You mr. president   in the light of a very busy news week a   lot of people would like to get to the   bottom of a couple of things give you a   chance to go on record here did you at   any time   urge former FBI director James Comey in   any way shape or form to close or to   back down the investigation into Michael   Flynn and also as you know no next   question next question   as you look back over the past six   months or year have you had any   recollection where you've wondered if   anything you have done has been   something that might be worthy of   criminal charges in these investigations   or impeachment as some on the left or   implying I think it's totally ridiculous   everybody thinks so and again we have to   get back to work in our country properly   so that we can take care of the problems   that we have we have plenty of problems   we've done a fantastic job we have a   tremendous group of people millions and   millions of people out there that are   looking at what you had just said and   said what are they doing director Comey   was very unpopular with most people   I actually thought when I made that   decision and I also got a very very   strong recommendation as you know from   the Deputy Attorney General Rod   Rosenstein but when I made that decision   I actually thought that it would be a   bipartisan decision because you look at   all of the people on the Democratic side   not only the Republican side that was   saying such terrible things about   director Comey then he had the very poor   performance on Wednesday that was a poor   poor performance so poor in fact that I   believe and you'd have to ask him   because I don't like to speak for other   people but I believe that's why the   Deputy Attorney General went out and   wrote his very very strong letter and   then on top of that after the Wednesday   performance by director Comey   you had a person come and have to   readjust the record which many people   have never seen before because they were   miss statements made and I thought that   was something that was terrible we need   a great director of the FBI I cherish   the FBI it's special all over the world   no matter where you go the FBI is   special   the FBI has not had that special   reputation with what happened in the   campaign what happened with respect to   the Clinton campaign and even you could   say directly or indirectly with respect   to the much more successful Trump   campaign we're going to have a director   who   is going to be outstanding I'll be   announcing that director very soon and I   look forward to doing it I think the   people in the FBI will be very very very   very thrilled and just in concluding we   look forward to getting this whole   situation behind us so that when we go   for the jobs we'll go for the strong   military when we go for all of the   things that we've been pushing so hard   and so successfully including healthcare   because Obamacare is collapsing it's   dead it's gone there's nothing to   compare anything to because we don't   have health care in this country you   just look at what's happening Aetna just   pulled out other insurance companies are   pulling out we don't have health care   Obamacare is a fallacy it's gone we need   health care we need to cut taxes we're   going to cut taxes forget what I want it   will be the biggest tax cut in the   history of our nation and that's what I   want it's going to bring back companies   it's going to bring back jobs we lost so   many jobs and so many companies to   countries that are not so far from you   mr. president they're very close to you   actually and to many other places   throughout the world we're going to   change that we're going to have   expansion we already do you look at   what's happening with Ford and with   General Motors in Michigan and Ohio you   look at the tremendous number of jobs   that are being announced in so many   different fields and that's what I'm   proud of and that's what we want to   focus our energy on the other is   something I can only tell you there was   no collusion and everybody even my   enemies have said there is no collusion   so we want to get back and keep on the   track that we're on because the track   that we're on is record-setting   and that's what we want to do is we want   to break very positive records thank you   you could ask a question we've got to go   sorry you have a question for you yes   sir mr. president my question is in   someone who led a nation that's really   done a lot of rebuilding and had to   rebound from an epidemic of crime and   drugs over quite a many years what do   you make of mr. Trump's America first   policy and further   you've had a tough time with   conservative radio sometimes been called   a punching bag and you said you have to   persevere I'm curious if you've given   any advice to President Trump on how to   do so I I don't think I'm in a position   to give any advice to President Trump he   can take care of himself and what I what   I what we did in Colombia you quite   rightly mentioned it is persevere we   when you know you're part of the station   and we know you know and you know that   you're doing the correct thing you   simply have to persevere and that's what   we've done in Colombia and that's why we   were on the verge of being a failed   state from years ago and now we're one   of the stars of the region and that's   through hard work perseverance and   clarity of your objectives and that's   what we have done and we have to   continue because the trip is not over   Ricardo I want our list mr. president   I'd like to ask you about trade you are   about to start the renegotiation of   NAFTA and Colombia and like other   countries in the hemisphere has a large   comprised deficit with a United States   are you worried about the fact that that   could contribute to increasing that   trade and education on the peace process   in Colombia well it's been a long   process and it's been a great thing to   watch in the sense that the president   did a fantastic job that's not easy   after so many years of war so I'm very   very proud to get to know you and I   really congratulate you this nothing   tougher than Peaks   and we want to make peace all over the   world and you are really a great example   of somebody that started I mean FARC is   that was a long tough situation as you   know very well coming from the country   but I think the president has done a   magnificent job not easy but he's done a   magnificent job mascara no cotton got   your chromosome clear impossible on the   trade issue our deficit with the United   States is not so large it is a moderate   deficit which of course both countries   will try to increase the volume of trade   in both directions and investments also   in both directions Colombia is becoming   an important investor here in the United   States and it is something not many   people know but we have considerable   investments in the United States we have   attempted to give dynamism to these   flows of trade of investment getting   together those main players who are the   investors in the private sector I   believe the foundations have been laid   we have the Free Trade Agreement which   is working well the number of Colombian   businesses that are exporting to the   United States has grown and we both   believe that we can take greater   advantage of those agreements in order   to increase flows in both directions for   the benefit growth of the Colombian and   American people thank you very much   everybody thank you thank you   you   you

stationary she   and the Prime Minister of the Republic   of Italy thank you very much   [Music]   Prime Minister gentle Oni welcome great   honor thank you it's wonderful to have   you in our wonderful people's house   known as the White House and so many   great Italian friends are with us today   and we renew always the deep ties of   history and a friendship that linked   together the American and the Italian   peoples that history traces its roots to   the timeless contributions of Italy to   civilization and human progress so true   stretching all the way back to ancient   Rome through the ages your country has   been a beacon of artistic and scientific   achievement heck continues today from   Venice to florence from verde to   pavarotti friend of mine great friend of   mine these bonds of history and culture   have only grown stronger as our two   nations have become close partners dear   friends and very vital allies mr. prime   minister I'm thrilled that you are here   today to discuss how we can make this   great relationship even more productive   in the years to come when the economy   Italy is one of America's largest   trading partners a lot of people don't   know that we both seek a trading   relationship that is balanced reciprocal   I love the word reciprocal because we   don't have too many reciprocal trading   partnerships I will tell you that but we   will very soon and fair benefiting both   of our countries and we can work   together to achieve that outcome and   that will happen Italy is also a key   partner in the fight against terrorism   Italy is now the second largest   contributor of troops to the conflicts   in Iraq and Afghanistan I would also   like to thank you   Prime Minister for your leadership on   seeking stabilization in Libya and for   your crucial efforts to deny Isis a   foothold in the Mediterranean you fought   hard we're grateful for your role in the   anti-isis campaign all nations must   condemn this barbaric enemy and support   the effort to achieve its total and   complete destruction also as you know   mr. prime minister we have more than   30000 American service members families   and personnel who are stationed across   your country as we reaffirm our support   for historic institutions we must also   reaffirm the requirement that everyone   must pay their full and fair share for   the cost of defense together we can   address many pressing challenges   including to the greatly affect both of   our countries those of large-scale   migration and international smuggling   maintaining strong borders is a vital   component of any security policy and a   responsible approach to refugees is one   that seeks the eventual return of   refugees to their home countries so that   they can help to rebuild their own   nations finally I want to say how much i   look forward to visiting sicily for the   g7 as we seek to foster cooperation not   only in matters of security but also   science commerce health and technology   our two countries have shared interests   and shared values and we can each make   great contributions to the other mr.   prime minister I again want to thank you   for being with us and being our true   friend Italy is a spectacular place I   know it well I love the people of Italy   we have   18 million Italians living in the United   States people originally from Italy and   it's a great honor to have many of them   as my friends thank you for being here   thank you thank you for hosting us here   and honored to be here at the White   House today and I'll now switch to   Italian and BMO we had a very fruitful   meeting which reflects an ancient   friendship as the president reminded us   with his words this friendship is also   sign of the 18 million Italian Americans   who have such an important role in our   country in this country and this   friendship is witnessed also by the fact   that Italy is the second choice for   American students who study abroad and   we're very proud of this and this   confirms the importance that the United   States gives to the cultural dimension   of our country as the president himself   just said this friendship is based on a   common commitment against terrorism this   commitment see is a commitment in which   we are both very active our country is   very active in iraq and afghanistan and   i think that the stabilization work will   be decisive the stabilization work of   iraq after the military defeat that we   are expected for dodge we know that this   action against terrorism must take place   within our individual countries in   europe with the social and cultural   commitment against radicalization by   cooperating with islamic communities   italy contributes to peace and   disability in the Mediterranean in Syria   where I believe the u.s. choice to react   to the use of chemical weapons by Bashar   Assad and where a negotiated solution is   more necessary than ever in Libya and we   discussed this in our meeting where we   need to work against the division of the   country in order to stabilize it this is   a very decisive task if we want to   manage the migratory flows without   giving up on our values and our   humanitarian principles and we need to   contrast the horrible traffic of people   and clandestine refugees Italy is   convinced of its strategic commitment in   favor of the transatlantic relationship   we have also spoken about common   commitments in NATO and the goals that   were identified in 2014 and the   commitments on military expenses and the   contribution that each country must make   towards collective security we are proud   of our contribution and finally Italy is   a country of dialogue we are proud   because we succeeded and keep an open   the doors and difficult crises dialogue   can be useful even these are the Russia   without obviously giving up our unity   and our principles and without giving up   our strength and our values   I also told President Pro Trump that we   have confidence even though this is a   difficult moment and we all know it's   difficult right now we have confidence   in the future of the European Union and   certainly in the importance of the   relationship between the u.s. and Italy   these are the two pillars that the   transatlantic relationship is based on   and great part of peace and freedom in   the world we are going through a   difficult time but I have confidence   that the European Union will continue to   be a positive response to this and   finally we are expecting and I look   forward to the president's visit to the   summit in Taormina and I trust that this   will be the opportunity to show him the   unity of our leaders and the the   principal free economies of a planet   because right now we really do need this   to unity once again Thank You mr.   president thank you very much thank you   appreciate it take a few questions John   Roberts of Fox please I hope you'll   forgive me for asking you or three part   questions it's been a while in just the   last few minutes and i believe it was   was while you're a meeting with the   Prime Minister there was a shooting in   downtown Paris is being described as the   potential terrorist attack I wonder if   you have something on that and further   to that to the big trouble spots that   you're dealing with right now North   Korea and Iran do you believe that the   leader of North Korea Kim jong-un is   mentally unstable is that one of the   reasons why you're so concerned about   these latest developments is he a man   who can be reasoned with and on Iran do   you have reason to suspect that they are   cheating on the jcpoa and to mr. prime   minister you talked just a moment ago   but you can it your commitment to NATO   president Trump would like to see all   NATO members contribute two percent of   their gdp to NATO your contribution is   slightly less than one percent will you   commit to   two percent of your GDP to the Alliance   going forward thank you well first of   all I love the question you asked the   Prime Minister I look forward to his   answer because I'm going to be asking   them that same question versa well first   of all our condolences from our country   to the people of France again it's   happening it seems I just saw it as i   was walking in so that's a terrible   thing and it's a very very terrible   thing that's going on in the world today   but it looks like another terrorist   attack and what can you say just never   ends we have to be strong and we have to   be vigilant that I've been saying it for   a long time as far as North Korea is   concerned we are in very good shape   we're building our military rapidly a   lot of things have happened over the   last short period of time I've been here   for approximately 91 days we're doing a   lot of work we're in very good position   we're going to see what happens I can't   ask your answer your question on   stability I hope the answer is a   positive one not a negative one but   hopefully that will be something that   gets taken care of I have great respect   for the president of China as you know   we had a great summit in Florida and   Palm Beach and got to know each other   and I think like each other I can say   from my standpoint I liked him very much   I respect him very much and I think he's   working very hard i can say that all of   the pundits out there saying they never   have seen China work like they're   working right now many coal ships have   said back many other things have   happened some very unusual moves have   been made over the last two or three   hours and I really have confidence that   the president will try very hard we   don't know whether or not they're able   to do that but I have absolute   confidence that he will be trying very   very hard and one of the reasons that   we're talking about trade deals and   we're talking about all of the different   things but we're slowing up a little bit   I actually told them I said you'll make   a much better deal on trade   if you get rid of this menace or do   something about the Menace of North   Korea because that's what it is it's a   menace right now so we'll see what   happens as far as Iran is concerned I   think they are doing a tremendous   disservice to an agreement that was   signed it was a terrible agreement it   shouldn't have been signed it shouldn't   have been negotiated the way it was   negotiated I'm all for agreements but   that was a bad one as bad as I've ever   seen negotiated they are not living up   to the spirit of the agreement I can   tell you that and we're analyzing it   very very carefully and we'll have   something to say about it in the   not-too-distant future but Iran has not   lived up to the spirit of the agreement   and they have to do that they have to do   that so we will see what happens thank   you very much Thank You mr. president   hey pretty much first of all allow me to   join president Trump's words for what   happened in Paris these are words of   condolences and closest to the French   people and this is a very delicate   delicate period for them there's just   three days before the election as far as   the question is concerned the commitment   has been made it was made during the   NATO summit and we are used to   respecting our commitments we know that   this will be a gradual process it has   already begun and we know that Italy has   certain limitations when it comes to its   budget it despite these limitations our   commitment for common defense is very   clear and as I said earlier i'm very   proud not only of the progress made by   in our financial commitment but also   proud of the contribution that we give   to the security of the Alliance   in so many areas of the world but we   talked about Iraq and Afghanistan but we   could also talk about the baltic sea or   the balkans and in all of these areas   you will see the presence of italian   forces within the Alliance and we are   proud of that jovanna part are you okay   skyitalia prima bella first for you   president gentle only I wanted to ask   you we saw from the zoo administration   and new type of policy on ancient the   international scene very different from   what we had in the past and one of the   last important operations which was   carried out by President Trump was in   Syria with a bombing of following the   use of chemical weapons by the Assad   regime I wanted to ask you this Italy   think or conceive a possibility to take   action and more acting and more action   in Syria and since my colleague from Fox   News did it so high I'm gonna take us a   while a possibility to ask you to   question first of all about European   Union you're setting a pass the brexit   was a great thing and that you think   that all the country will follow so you   know that Italy is an important player   and supporter of European integration do   you believe that actually a strong   Europe is important from for the United   States also looking forward at a French   election and then the second question is   that you said that you're looking   forward to come to Italy for the g7 and   I wanted to know if you're also looking   forward if it's going to be possible to   meet Pope Francis during your Italian   trick thank you syria syria   we immediately assess the operation that   was ordered by President Trump and   decided that this is a motivated   response to the use of chemical weapons   we added that it's up to everyone to   consider negotiation as the road through   which we hopefully can put an end to   this infinite dramatic war and come to   peace Italy is not directly involved in   the operations and military operations   in Syria other than marginal aspects but   it's not our plan to change this   attitude yes as strong Europe is very   very important to me as president of the   United States and it's also in my   opinion in my very strong opinion   important for the United States we want   to see it we will help it be strong and   it's very much to everybody's advantage   and I look very much forward to meeting   the Pope   [Music]   Fabian of the hill Fabian yes Thank You   mr. president some people on Capitol   Hill believe you can get one of two   things next week a vote on healthcare or   a vote on a government funding bill so   my question is which one is more   important to you to have a vote on   healthcare or a vote on a bill to keep   the government open and mr. Prime   Minister I want to get your thoughts on   a referendum in Turkey that occurred   last week you spoke about democratic   values in the European continent so are   you concerned with the result of the   Turkish referendum is that something   that you discussed with President Trump   okay i want to get both are you shocked   to hear that and we're doing very well   in health care we'll see what happens   but this is a great bill there's a great   plan and this will be great health care   it's evolving you know there was never a   give up the press sort of reported there   was like a give up there's no give up we   started remember it took Obamacare 17   months I've really been negotiating this   for two months maybe even less than that   because we had a 30 day period where we   did lots of other things the first 30   days but this has really been two months   and this is a continuation and the plan   gets better and better and better and   it's gotten really really good and a lot   of people are liking it a lot we have a   good chance of getting it soon I'd like   to say next week but it will be I   believe we will get it and whether it's   next week or shortly thereafter as far   as keeping the government open I think   we want to keep the government open   don't you agree so yeah I think we'll   get both thank you hey yeah the Turkish   referendum   is the fact that we must take note of   leaving aside and the debates that can   take place about how the vote took place   but I believe that the European   leadership have taken note of the vote   the consequences will depend a great   deal on how the Turkish government and   president aired one especially will take   into account almost half of the   populations expression of a different   opinion there will there be an inclusive   approach or will there be confrontation   in this part of Turkey this will be very   important for us in the European Union   the other thing that's going to be very   important is to is the respect of the   certain fundamental principles we are   members of the Atlantic Alliance Italy   in Turkey and Italy contributes to   Turkey's defense with its own military   assets we believe that among our   countries there should be a cooperation   yeah and hopefully and we trust that   this cooperation will have among its   consequences the solution of the case   concerning the journalists bloggers   who's detained who's been detained over   the last few days in Turkey   John Ruffolo Italian Rick mataji   president until you know you have   focused a lot on the the leadership   Italian leadership and American   leadership in order to stabilize Libya   what do you expect exactly from   Washington and especially I'm asking you   what is necessary in this process in   this relationship of cooperation with   Russia zentrum do you see a role for   your administration in helping   stabilizing Libya and do you agree that   the stabilizing Libya means combating   terrorism and the ISIS you like to go my   America has played a very key role first   of all to prevent the consolidation of   an important basis for terrorism while   dash was undergoing defeats in Iraq and   Syria there were operations that were   sustained by the US against daesh in the   city of CA which were successful now the   commitment must be political and   therefore in the cooperation between us   and Italy and other key partners in the   region the goal is to broaden the conf   ases of the consensus for the Tripoli   government which is recognized by the   international community but which must   be able to count on I broader consensus   I believe that one clear goal goal   should be this we need the region and we   need countries like Egypt in Tunisia   that are close to Libya we need a stable   and unified Libya a divided country and   in conflict would be would make a   stability worse   the us's job is the u.s. role sorry and   this is very critical do not see a role   in Libya I think the United States has   right now enough roles we're in a roll   everywhere so I do not say that i do see   a role in getting rid of Isis we're   being very effective in that regard we   are doing a job with respect to Isis   that it has not been done anywhere near   the numbers that we're producing right   now I would say it's a very effective   force we have we have no choice it's a   horrible thing to say but we have no   choice and we are effectively ridding   the world of Isis I see that as a   primary role and that's what we're going   to do whether it's in Iraq or in Libya   or anywhere else and that role will come   to an end at a certain point and we'll   be able to go back home and rebuild our   country which is what I want to do thank   you all very much I appreciate it thank   you   Oh
N61tUeqQVY0~Trump TV Network~20170203~Donald Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer Press Conference (2/3/2017 ) Sean Spicer Live~31721.0~3.72413802147~79.0~37.0~   what happened thank you I worked on the   tie Charlie Sheen had some issues with   it yesterday good afternoon everyone   happy Friday it's another busy day here   at the White House and across the Trump   administration the first jobs report   under the president's administration was   released this morning it's national wear   red day highlighting the importance of   preventing heart disease its national   schools national catholic schools week   and the president is going to be signing   some executive orders delivering some   much-needed regulatory relief to lenders   and borrowers in the next few minutes   we're finishing up the second week here   really strong yesterday was another   great deal was reached with Lockheed   Martin for the purchase of a new lot of   f-35s through the president's   intervention a total of ninety planes   for a lot of 90 planes 55 were purchased   for US military that added up to a total   of four hundred and fifty five million   dollar savings for us taxpayers from the   previous lot with an average cost   reduction of 75 percent another big win   that the president has delivered on for   us taxpayers speaking of good numbers   let's turn to the jobs report the   economy added more than two hundred   twenty-seven thousand new jobs   significantly more than 175000 that had   been expected today's report reflects   the consumer cotton the consumer   confidence that the trouble has inspired   according to a recent gallup poll   economic confidence is that a new high   and adp sewed strong private sector   hiring president Trump campaigned on how   to make America work again even before   the he took office the markets knew he   would deliver on that promise the   president's already taken significant   steps to turn our economy around and   he's looking forward to ensuring that   every American who wants a job has the   opportunity to find one while the   president's definitely pleased that the   job growth has far surpassed   expectations and that the labor force   participation is rising he also   recognizes that there's a lot more work   to be done the president has a big and   bold agenda to grow the US economy in to   create   in just his first two weeks in office   he's met with more than 50 business   leaders across a vast range of   industries this morning the president   participated in a strategic and Policy   Forum with business leaders from some of   our country's most successful companies   the president understands the importance   of an open dialogue with fellow business   leaders on how to make the economy econo   the nation's economy stronger his   firsthand experiences the successful   businessman helps to guide his decisions   as president and he will continue to   seek opinions of other job creators   while crafting an economic agenda all of   these meetings are focused on one   primary goal providing new and improved   employment opportunities for all   Americans we're looking at a full range   of policy measures to achieve that goal   regulatory relief tax and trade reform   empowering women in the workplace   rebuilding America's crumbling   infrastructure and improving our   education system also today in pursuit   of that goal the president will be   signing to executive actions as part of   his plan to overhaul our financial   regulatory system I expect that to   happen closer to one o'clock hour the   first is an executive order proposing   guideline principles that sets the table   for a regulatory system that mitigates   risk encourages growth and more   importantly protects consumers the   dodd-frank act is a disastrous policy   that's hindering our markets reducing   the availability of credit and crippling   our economy's ability to grow and create   jobs it imposed hundreds of new   regulations and financial institute on   financial institutions while   establishing unaccountable and   unconstitutional a new agency that does   not adequately protect consumers perhaps   worst of all despite all that's   overreaching dodd-frank did not address   the causes of the financial crisis   something we all know must be done it   did not solve the too big to fail and we   must determine conclusively that the   failure of a large bank will never again   leave taxpayers on the hook the   presidential memorandum addresses the   burdensome government regulations in the   Department of Labor's fiduciary rule the   rule is a solution in search of a   problem there are better ways to protect   investors in the trump administration is   taking action to do so we're directing   the Department of Labor to review this   rule the rules intent   maybe to have provided retirees and   others with better financial advice but   in reality its effect has been able to   it is to limit the financial services   that are available to them the president   Trump does not intend to put unnecessary   limits on Economic Opportunity the   Department of Labor exceeded its   authority with this rule and this is   exactly the kind of government   regulatory overreach the president was   put in office to stop we desperately   need to overhaul how we approach   financial regulation the president is   taking action to protect American   taxpayers and get people back to work   moving on we announced earlier this week   that we would be taking steps to address   Iran's recent actions today the US   sanctions 25 individuals and entities   that provide support to Iran's ballistic   missile program and the Islamic   Revolutionary cooed force these   designations are in response to Iran's   on going ballistic missile program   including its ballistic missile tests on   January 29 2017 as well as Iran's   continued support for terrorism we've   taken these actions today after careful   consideration and will continue to   respond with appropriate action these   designations mark yet another stop and   our continued effort to aggressively   target Iran's ballistic missile program   and terrorism related activities over at   the Department of Defense Secretary   madison's on a final day of a two-day   trip through Asia he visited Korea   yesterday in

address to personnel general Dunford and   general Flynn will also be present for   the meetings and the president returned   to Washington that evening with that I'm   going to go to my first Skype question   seat Jackie nesper all from NBC 6 in   South Florida Jackie good afternoon on   behalf of the viewers of South Florida   thanks so much for this opportunity you   know a lot of focus on Foreign Affairs   this week and new sanctions announced   today against Iran and of course Miami   as you know is home to the largest   cuban-american community in the country   and during the campaign president Trump   talked about his discontent with the   warming of us-cuban relations   implemented by President Obama and in   the last days of his administration he   ended the web for dry food policy   leaving thousands of Cubans in limbo so   my question is twofold a has there been   any contact between your administration   in the Cuban government and B are there   any plans to change the current policy   right now thanks Jackie we are in the   midst of a full review of all US   policies towards Cuba the president is   committed to an agenda of ensuring human   rights for all citizens throughout the   world and as we review those policies in   Cuba that will be forefront in them in   their policy discussions but there's   nothing that we have on that front at   this point Francesca chambers   united states with new sanctions on iran   previously this morning the president   has said that they were playing with   fire you said that appropriate actions   we continue to be taken is this the full   extent of the punishing actions that   we're seeing right now and our military   options still on the table and   responsive administration saying that   all options are on the table thanks for   the question I think one of the things   that the president has said throughout   the campaign during the transition and   since becoming president is it he   doesn't like to Telegraph his options   that's how he believes you can have a   much greater successful option so I'm   not going to go into the full extent I   think today's sanctions really represent   a very very strong stand against the   actions that Iran has been taking and   make it very clear that the deal that   the struck private previously was not in   the best interest of this country and   that President Trump is going to do   everything he can to make sure that Iran   a stayed in check so that there are more   actions coming though I just I would   never rule anything off the table I   think the president's made it clear   throughout the table throughout his time   that that's what's gonna happen Jeff   yeah thanks a lot fun I wanted to ask   about one of the members that has been   announced as being part of president   Trump's team in said Gina Haslam sector   Senator Ron Wyden has written to the   president saying that her background   makes her unsuitable to be the CIA   deputy director and what he was   specifically referencing was her role in   the enhanced interrogation program that   the CIA had during the course of the   Bush administration do you believe that   this background is a disqualify her for   that   I think she's had an unbelievably   distinguished career as a covert   operative she basically gave up that to   come out and serve in this role at the   request of director pompeo and I think   she has been a very very distinguished   servant to the American people and is   highly qualified for that position next   I'm going to go to Jack McElveen over at   from nwm you are in New Hampshire Jay   Sean Sean thanks for taking the question   and everyone for the Patriots coming   down in a couple of months a lot of   people up here hoping that happens as   well get into business though for more   than two years the number one public   health and safety threat facing the   state is the heroin and opioid crisis   during the campaign the president   promised to be swift and aggressive when   it came to this problem stopping the   flow of drugs coming across the border   increasingly though the problem lies in   synthetic fentanyl is being cooked up in   labs in the Northeast what is the   administration doing on that front as   well as the treatment aspect of   addiction and secondly if I may with the   understanding it is a state-issued New   Hampshire's poised to become a right to   work state but the voting expected to be   close given the administration's   favorable view of right to work is it   actively engaged in that effort and if   not what is the general message from the   White House thanks Josh first on on the   opioid crisis that is a major problem   for not just New Hampshire but for so   many states across the country I think   one of the things beyond that the health   issue is is to make sure that we're   looking at border issues in the flow of   heroin through our southern border is   something that the president obviously   takes that's part of his whole strong   immigration stance on border security   having that wall built having additional   assets on the southern border will go a   long way to stem the flow of illegal   drugs into the country from our southern   border up through the states it was   obviously as you mentioned a big issue   that he made in New Hampshire throughout   the primary I continued so on the   campaign and it's going to something   that as soon as Tom Price and others are   confirmed throughout the department this   has got a health component to it has got   a border issue to it so there is a multi   government approach that needs to be   taken to the opioid crisis with respect   to right to work I think you accurately   portrayed it the president believed   in right-to-work he wants to give   workers and companies the flexibility to   do what's in the best interest for job   creators obviously the vice president   has been a champion of this as well it's   something that is a big deal in Indiana   and something that he has championed as   well like when I asked you about   dodd-frank yeah beyond the executive   order that's going to be signed here   momentarily is the administration   planning on or working with Congress to   overturn certain portions of the law   itself done with an executive order if   so what might that be what might that   timeline being a clean say take a full   repeal of dodd-frank is actively being   considered or not well I think there's   two aspects of this there's the   administrative piece which he's starting   to address through executive action and   then there's a legislative pieces I   think we're going to work with Congress   on but I mean I think I'd go back to   what I said earlier that dodd-frank has   been as not has been both a disaster in   terms of the impact that it's had but   also it hasn't achieved the goal and I   think that there's no question that the   president talked about this extensively   the impact that it's had and in it's not   it's not an either/or it's it's frankly   just not doing what it's set out to do   and so I think we're going to continue   not just to act through administration   administrative action but through   through working with Congress and figure   out a legislative fix a major Garrett no   Sean meeting with the Australian   ambassador here yesterday was to set   free business Steve banning can you   describe what that meeting was about and   did the administration make a commitment   which curfew State Department yesterday   that in fact all of those subject to the   Obama administration agreement are still   possible refugee resettlement or some   sort of process what was communicated   and on the Iran sanctions Adam szubin is   the acting Treasury secretary he was of   course in charge of sanctions at the   Treasury Department before oftentimes   these are a long time and development   were these sanctions something that   we're kind of on his desk or had been   identified and that's what made them so   not easy available to enact so rapidly   yeah I think those are I think you   correctly pointed out I mean he served   last administration these kind of   sanctions don't happen quickly but I   think the timing of them was clearly in   reaction to what we've seen over the   last couple days we knew we had these   options available to us because they had   been worked through the process but we   acted swiftly and decisively today   because the timing was right so you know   they were in the pipeline they'd been   staffed and approved and the president   made the decision that now was the time   to do it based on recent action and I'm   sorry and on that chair a chief of staff   previous and chief strategist Bannon did   meet with the Prime Minister yesterday I   think they had a very productive the   ambassador thank you appreciate the   correction they did have a very   productive and candid conversation we   have a tremendous amount of respect for   the people of Australia for Prime   Minister Trumbull and it was a follow-up   on the call but we're going to tin you   to work through this we're going to   honor the commitments that we've made in   some way meaning that we are going to   vet these people in accordance with the   agreement that happened and will   continue to have further updates as we   do John Roberts sorry receiver last   night on settlements is really has   differed a shift in US policy while you   said that you didn't think that they   were helpful to achieving peace I'd also   didn't think that they were an   impediment to peace which would   represent a departure for both obama and   bush   there was no reaffirmation of a   two-state solution in that statement so   where are you on that the president is   committed to peace that's his goal and I   think when the president and Prime   Minister Netanyahu meet here on the   fifteenth that will obviously be the   topic on that at the end of the day the   goal is peace and i think that's that's   what you have to keep mine i think that   is going to be a subject that they   discuss when they meet on the fifteenth   and and that's as far as I want to go on   it right start back to seven yeah what   is your position on settlements in terms   of whether or not they I mean you said   that they were not an impediment to   peace but you also don't want the   building new one right website I mean I   think the statement is very clear about   that we don't believe that the existence   of current settlements is an impediment   to peace but i think the construction or   expansion of existing settlements beyond   the current borders is not going to be   helpful moving forward that's what   they're tryin ta mess of Congress   requested the president Trump not   interfere with the current way   unemployment is calculated by the   Department of Labor does the president   intend to comply with their request and   a related question how many of the two   hundred and twenty-seven thousand jobs   added to the u.s. in January does the   president attribute to his   administration versus the Obama   administration I think look when you   look at the confident the confidence   indexes I'm not going to get in the one   fortune we don't have that kind of a   breakdown I think that you've seen the   actions that he's taken whether it scary   or some of the other companies sprint   and Softbank clearly there is a desire   for companies to want to come be part of   this Trump agenda and build and   manufacture create jobs bring jobs back   but I'm not I'm not have liberty to   start parsing the BLS and other reports   as far as where that comes down but look   his team led by Gary Cohen was really   pleased the numbers to this morning   obviously we're pleased that were you   know 227000 jobs is a great is a great   kickoff we hope they get better we know   that there's a lot more work to do and   that's why the president continues to   meet with business leaders union leaders   to help figure out how we can grow the   economy yeah Ashley pick up   revealed in an alexandria court case   today that over a hundred thousand visas   and have been revoked in part of the   president's travel ban does that include   visa holders who are already in the   United States and will the government   begins finding them and trying to deport   the happy I'll have to get back to you   on that I don't have all the details on   that right now six hours ago the   president tweeted that professional   anarchist thumbs and paved protesters   are proving the point of millions of you   voted to make America great again   because the administration have any   intention of investigating the groups   who have been riding it conservative or   pro Trump events I think we know who   they are I don't know that we need to do   an investigation yeah this is the   president's team the letter sent from   Senator McCain yesterday and if so is he   looking into arming the prince I don't   know I have to get back to you on that   yeah Charlie Charlie ambassador nikki   Haley came out for strong state yes   Russia and yesterday does the   administration have plans to keep the   sanctions against Russia in place or do   they have any intention of adding more   sanctions so there's there's two things   1i think I commented the other day on on   the sanctions that Treasury put out   those are in fact routine or the   clarification there a routine   clarification that occurs with respect   to the the sanctions I think ambassador   Haley made it very clear of our concern   with Russia's occupation of Crimea we   are not and and so there's I think she   spoke very forcefully and clearly on   that if I can I'd like to go to the   third skype question Christopher sign   from abc15 in Arizona Sean thank you for   doing this hello from a sunny and   beautiful Phoenix with the likely   confirmation on the horizon with a new   veteran affairs secretary there has been   discussion regarding privatizing the VA   there's also still concerns regarding   wait times even overall care and some   reports regarding the suicide rate what   is the reform that the administration is   seeking here also whoa the   administration protect whistleblowers   second part of the question we've seen   Oh tests here in Phoenix as in the   nationwide as well when you talk about   unity what is the administration doing   to bring more unity to the nation and   even more transparency as here in   Phoenix we saw that secret meeting on   the tarmac but we talked about how   is the administration repairing office   thanks Chris first I mean I think the   president I mostly through deed   continues to show that he wants to bring   people together in this country figure   out how to move the country forward both   economically job-wise i think that is   something that continues to show a   desire for talked about it as an   inaugural address and the prayer   breakfast so I think he's going to   continue to throw through both word and   deed his desire to move the country   forward trying to think and you can go   back to the first part that's all right   big a confirmation hypocaust podium dr.   dr. shogun yeah look I think first and   foremost on VA reform you know the   number one thing is to get dr. Scholl   can confirmed and so many of these as I   brought up in the past couple days it's   hard to talk about how we're going to   enact in a an agenda of reform when   Senate Democrats continue to slow walk   some of these folks and I think that's a   big problem dr. shokan is the right   individual to reform the VA to   understand whether it's lending or   medical care the problems and the   challenges that we face the VA these are   people who have served our nation and   deserve the best care they can get   whether that's the mortgage lending   health care or the variety of other   stuff that the VA serves or provides to   our veterans and I think that what the   president has done is talk to people   like dr. Toby Cosgrove at Cleveland   Clinic and other business leaders about   providing a better approach to serving   the needs of our veterans right now   you're right there are still wait times   that are unacceptable there's care   that's unacceptable we've got to address   that and and he's going to continue to   do it david jackson sean during the   campaign the candidate Trump Abby Lee   said he was gonna void the Iranian   nuclear right bottom line is he gonna do   that was gonna let us today I think   today's action speaks for itself in   terms of the sanctions he's made it very   very clear David that the deal that was   struck was a bad deal that we gave a ran   too much and we got too little for it   and I think that he is going to continue   to be tough on Iran in a way that wasn't   done in the last eight years I think   today's actions and the way that we   expedited those sanctions are another   example of how he's going to stay tough   on them let me let me go to the fourth   skype see dale jackson from w VN n talk   radio in huntsville alabama Sean thank   you very much for taking questions from   outside the elite media bubble there   MDC my question is about immigration   Donald Trump made this the forefront of   his campaign the foundation of it yet   the daca and DAPA program still exist   and I learned from a member of Congress   yesterday that the Trump administration   is still issuing the work permits at the   suffocate individuals question one is   when there are these programs going to   be ended in question 2 when will they   stop issuing work permits to these   individuals well thanks Dale I think as   you know the secretary Kelly just   assumed office we are reviewing these   programs we've made it very clear that   will have further updates on immigration   both both with report to daca and DAPA   the president has made significant   progress on addressing the pledge that   he made the American people regarding   immigration problems that we face and I   think we're going to see more action on   that in the next few weeks yes sir   Donald I yesterday the president   described NAFTA as a catastrophe we've   heard about his concerns with Mexico but   i'm wondering if he can outline some of   the irritants that he finds along the   Canadian border and if there's any talk   of a meeting with Prime Minister true I   think he has spoken to Prime Minister   Trudeau I know that they're looking at   setting up a time to come down we've   been in constant contact with Canadian   officials and I think that will be a   meeting that is set up very shortly   Sarah thanks John russia's Foreign   Minister across the administration for   further details on the president's plans   to establish safe zones in Syria the   president is said to have discussed this   yesterday with King Abdullah when can we   expect further details on that plan   that's a good question I think that we   are as you noted in the readouts from   last weekend that has been a subject   that has come up with with all of the   Middle East leaders that he's talked   about it's an area that he feels   strongly about and I think as he   continues to have follow-up   conversations we can expect further   details it's something that secretary   tillerson obviously just got sworn into   office that there will be further   follow-up on that yeah   I'm president will meet with japanese /   mr. other our next friday yes sao paulo   main topic for the meeting with the   president tells us to find investors in   the lobby right japan should pay more   and pick up all the expense so main the   u.s. me to repeat in japan right i think   there's going to be a lot of both trade   in national security i think as we get   closer that meeting all of further   information on but right now as you can   imagine but there's an economic aspect   to this and then there's a national   security aspect to this intrinsic line   sure you've referenced poles a couple of   times from the podium but the poll came   out today CBS says the president's a   forty percent approval rating we've seen   the approval ratings drop during the   transition period he talks about pulls a   great deal during the campaign hey what   do you think that says about the way the   American people are looking at these   actions is taking Andy what do you think   it says about his pledge to unite the   country on the ease of his election I   think there's also a rasmussen poll that   showed he had 51 percent approval rating   you had an ipsos writers pull the other   day that showed and again I don't have   it handy but a majority of people per   you know a protocol I know I understand   that and I think that as the president's   policies continue to get enacted you   know for all the hysteria regarding his   efforts to protect the country on those   seven countries where we had didn't have   the proper vetting in place to secure to   ensure that the American people were   safe what we did have was a very high   response to the American people in   support of that his policies continue to   do it the president understands this is   a marathon not a sprint as he continues   to get people back to work protect this   country I think the poll numbers were   locked in a court Jeff on   administration and Hubert record raise   the head of that agency that I don't   have a staff announcement on the CB fpv   right now but we'll see what we gonna   criticize the bureau broadly but yeah I   want to see its day out III think we'll   have further updates on that that's an   area that we need to work with Congress   on April Shawn two things I'm one you   said something about President Trump   talking on the Facebook live wherever   guys doin um the address that he was   going to talk about black history month   and issues pertaining to the African   their community couple well when you   first came a couple days into the   administration I asked you about the   agenda the black agenda that he had   possibly formulated was formulating as   he came out maybe the day before with   the issue of Chicago or the day after   something around that time Chicago and   sending the feds in if it doesn't change   has he now formulated a plan to deal   with the black community not just with   issues of law and order what is that I   mean he had a meeting with   african-american leaders the other day   in the Roosevelt Room I think part of   this is to your point isn't just law and   order it's jobs it's education its   healthcare small business lending   there's a lot that goes along with that   agenda and I think part of these   business meetings they have are about   hiring and small business and job   creation all of those issues I think are   at the forefront of small business that   community so it's not just a single   thing I think there's a lot whether it's   it's crime in law and order and   education healthcare small business job   creation that impacts that entire   segment of the population that that   whether they're living in in rural part   of the country or an inner city and I   think that's what he's really focused on   right now so he's not formulated peace   he's manipulating the agenda absolutely   okay so the second question CBD what's   on the table for that we're not getting   I have nothing to announce on that okay   right now but I don't have nothing to   announce the people aren't I you're   scaring people I understand we've heard   a lot of rumors about what may or may   know when we have something to announce   on that we will we'll do it but I don't   think it should be any surprise that the   president when it comes to rooting out   radical as   terrorism which is what that initially   was supposed to be focused on he is   going to make sure that he's that that   is a major focus of his keeping this   country safe and so I don't have   anything further for you on that I'm   just hide in your reports April I   reports I don't have anything for you so   I just made it I just said I don't have   anything for you but I would be very   clear that this President's commitment   to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism   it's something that is at the forefront   of his agenda and I know that there's   been a lot of reports about where that   program or that effort is going to lie I   have nothing else to thank you april   cecilia presents a tough talk tough   language on iran's playing with fire   should Americans be ready for the   possibility of military action with Iran   is that on the table look I've said this   before the president's been very clear   he doesn't take options off the table   but he understands the impact of   something like that the sanctions today   I think are going to be very very strong   and impactful and I hope that I Ron   realizes that after the provocative   measures that they've taken that they   understand that this president this   administration is not going to sit back   take it lightly John Gizzi Thank You   Sean and monday several public reports   saying that it will be a tie in the   Senate on the confirmation of Betsy   DeVos count Secretary of Education and   Mike Pence will have to cast an historic   tie-breaking vote as vice president   should be weaved watching for any   surprises has the congressional affairs   office perhaps cotton one more vote from   the no camp into the yes or do you   expect the vice president to be on hand   to confer luck well I would say this   Betsy DeVos as I mentioned before is an   unbelievable champion of education for   children for teachers for parents I hope   that that vote you know gets it gets 60   70 votes she is an unbelievable   remarkable woman who has fought very   hard to improve our nation's education   system and to make sure that schools are   serving children and I think that we're   going to make sure we do everything we   can and we feel one hundred percent   confident that she will be confirmed   Monday night and be the next Secretary   of Education thank you guys have a great   weekend the president's about to sign   executive orders I hope you all have a   great weekend to those of you who can't   travel down to Florida   we'll be gaggling on the plane on Monday   thank you have a great weekend

their full   and proper financial contributions to   the NATO alliance which many of them   have not been doing many of them have   not been even close and they have to do   that Central Command and spent central   operations command are at the very   center of our fight against radical   Islamic terrorism America stands in awe   of your courage though serving at   CENTCOM have bravely fought

up against an enemy that celebrates   death and totally worships destruction   you've seen that Isis is on a campaign   of genocide committing atrocities across   the world radical Islamic terrorists are   determined to strike our homeland as   they did a 911 as they did from Boston   to Orlando to San Bernardino and all   across Europe you've seen what happened   in Paris and nice all over Europe it's   happening it's gotten to a point where   it's not even being reported and in many   cases the very very dishonest press   doesn't want to report it they have   their reasons and you understand that so   today we deliver a message in one very   unified voice to these forces of death   and destruction America and its allies   will defeat you we will defeat them we   will defeat radical Islamic terrorism   and we will not allow it to take root in   our country we're not going to allow it   you've been seeing what's been going on   over the last few days we need strong   programs so that people that love us and   want to love our country and will end up   loving our country are allowed in not   people that want to destroy us and   destroy our country   [Applause]   freedom security and justice will   prevail in his first State of the Union   message President George Washington   wrote that to be prepared for war is one   of the most effectual means of   preserving peace almost 200 years later   as the general general was also speaking   about Ronald Reagan he said that wisdom   comes in three very very strong words   peace through strength I've said it many   times during the campaign speaking in   front of tens of thousands of people at   one sitting and I'd always mention   America first a phrase that you probably   never heard make America great again   anybody ever and peace through strength   the men and women of the United States   military provide the strength to bring   peace to our troubled troubled times we   stand behind you we support your

you Brian your partnership with snap-on   is a great example of why vocational   education is the way of the future when   I was growing up in Queens we had   vocational schools that were great we   don't have schools like that so much   anymore but we're bringing them back   vocational schools these are very   talented people that love that type of   work and it's great work it really is   great

wonderful words made in the USA   [Applause]   the old days we used to is that we don't   use it so much anymore we're going to   start using it again made in the USA for   too long we've watched as our factories   have been closed and our jobs have been   sent to other faraway lands we've lost   seventy thousand factories since China   joined the world trade organization and   you've seen that you've heard about it   seventy thousand the World Trade   Organization another one of our   disasters but this election the American   people voted to end the theft of   American prosperity they voted to bring   back their jobs and to bring back their   dreams into our country that's why I'm   here today in just a few moments I will   be signing a buy American and hire   American executive order you haven't   heard about that a long time in this   country with this action we are sending   a powerful signal to the world we're   going to defend our workers protect our   jobs and finally put America first   [Applause]   I see all the make America great again   hat so it's it's a good crowd those are   good ads through the years snap-on tools   have been at the center of our   industrial life your tools have fixed   the cars our families depend on they've   sailed with the fleet's that patrol the   oceans they fixed the planes that cross   our skies and snap on tools have reached   the heights of space used by astronauts   in orbit to carry out their very very   important work and I don't know if you   noticed recently I signed a very big   order we're going to spend again on NASA   space program and that's something we   need and we also need it psychologically   but it's going to be very excited for   decades this company has served the   needs of American workers it's time we   had a federal government that does the   same the x and hire American order I'm   about to sign will help protect workers   and students like those of you in the   audience today this historic action   declares that the policy of our   government is to aggressively promote   and use american-made goods and to   ensure that American labor is hired to   do the job it's America first you've got   to believe it it's time it's time right   it's time   first we will fully monitor uphold and   enforce our by American laws which we   haven't done by American long as we cry   require that when the federal government   buys bills or funds a project domestic   goods and products should be used but   over the years these by American   standards have been gutted by excessive   waivers and reckless exemptions the   result has been countless jobs and   countless contracts that have been lost   to cheap subsidized and low quality   foreign goods with this order I'm   directing every single agency and our   government to strictly uphold our by   American laws to minimize the use of   waivers and to maximize made in America   content in all federal projects it's   time   and for the first time ever we are going   to crack down on foreign bidders that   used dumped steel and other subsidized   goods to take contracts from workers   like you they take them away and they've   been doing it for a long time not going   to happen anymore we are finally   standing up for our workers and for our   companies in short this order declares   that American projects should be made   with American goods no longer are we   going to allow foreign countries to   cheat our producers and our workers out   of federal contracts everyone in my   administration will be expected to   enforce every last by American provision   of behalf of the American worker and we   are going to investigate every single   trade deal that undermines these   provisions secondly we are going to   enforce the higher American rules that   are designed to protect jobs and wages   of workers in the United States we   believe jobs must be offered to American   workers first does that make sense   [Applause]   right now widespread abuse in our   immigration system is allowing American   workers of all backgrounds to be   replaced by workers brought in from   other countries to fill the same job for   sometimes less pay this will stop   American workers have long call for   reforms to end these visa abuses and   today their calls are being answered for   the first time that includes taking the   first steps to set in motion a long   overdue reform of h-1b visas right now   h-1b visas are awarded in a totally   random lottery and that's wrong instead   they should be given to the most skilled   and highest-paid applicants and they   should never ever be used to replace   Americans no one can compete with   American workers when they are given a   fair and level playing field which has   not happened for decades we're using   every tool at our disposal to restore   the American dream in fact when it comes   to wasteful destructive job-killing   regulations we are going to use a tool   you all know very well it's called the   sledgehammer so what we're going to use   we're also going to stand up for our   dairy farmers in Wisconsin   [Applause]   and I've been reading about it I've been   talking about it for a long time and   that demands really immediately fair   trade with all of our trading partners   and that includes canada because in   canada some very unfair things have   happened to our dairy farmers and others   and we're going to start working on that   with Ron and with Scott and with Paul   with all of your representatives what's   happened to you is very very unfair it's   another typical one-sided deal against   the United States and it's not going to   be happening for long so Scott you and   Ron and myself and Paul and everybody   else we're going to get together and   we're going to call canada and we're   going to say what happened and they   might give us an answer but we're going   to get the solution not just the answer   okay because we know what the solution   is all right and if you guys can't do it   will bring maybe rights Right see you   ready rights we'd better bring rights   back now we'll get that done we're going   to work on that very hard we're going to   work on it immediately in fact starting   today it's a terrible thing that   happened to the farmers of Wisconsin the   fact is NAFTA has been a disaster for   the United States a complete and total   disaster and we're going to do some   things and we have all sorts of rules   and regulations that are horrendous like   we want it started to negotiate with   Mexico immediately and we have these   provisions where you have to wait long   periods of time you have to notify   Congress and after you notify Congress   you have to get certified and then you   can't speak to them for a hundred days   the whole thing is ridiculous NAFTA has   been very very bad for our country it's   been very very bad for our companies and   for our workers and we're going to make   some very big   changes or we are going to get rid of   NAFTA for once and for all cannot   continue like this believe me big things   will be happening on tray with other   countries over the coming months and I   mean very big we're also working with   Congress on tax reform and   simplification and we're on time if we   get that health care approval so press   every one of your Congressman press   everybody because we want to get that   approval and it just makes the tax   reform easier and it makes it better and   it's going to make it steeper it's going   to be bigger and that's what we want to   do so we're in very good shape or tax   reform we have the concept of the plan   we're going to be announcing it very   soon but health care we have to get the   health care taken care of and as soon as   health care takes care of week we are   going to march very quickly you're going   to watch we're going to surprise you   right Steve minuchin right Secretary of   Treasury I see Shawn and stand up Shawn   let's stand up you know I had I had no   idea I was told a year ago he's been so   great to me I was told a year ago he's   like a world champion climber climb as   the trees and after that I look every   time I look at him I look at him no   differently i'm very impressed with that   young and he's also very good on   television a very helpful thank you   thank you man thank you will be making   big investments in rebuilding our   military and repairing our badly   depleted infrastructure and that will   happen soon also infrastructure big   infrastructure bill probably use it with   something else that's a little bit   harder to get approved in order to get   that approved but infrastructure is   coming and it's coming fast new ships   bridges tunnels and airplanes will be   constructed with American hands American   steel and yes American tools   [Applause]   as we work to restore the American Dream   at home we're also working to restore   America's standing abroad that means   strengthening our partnerships and   ensuring that our friends and allies pay   their fair share and that very much   includes as I've already said in my   little statement to Paul it also   includes the NATO country companies and   countries they are really sort of   letting us down in that one respect and   we don't want people taking advantage of   the United States and that's not going   to happen for very much longer I'm going   over there very soon and we're going to   have it and everybody's going to be   paying and we're going to be a much   happier country we're going to be a much   happier world no matter the   circumstances everyone will know we act   from this core conviction that America's   strength must be unmatched and its first   priority unquestioned the safety and   security of our citizens this is the   surest path to a more peaceful and   prosperous world for us all together we   can build a better future in the spirit   of this company's earliest days great   company great history I recently learned   that decades ago in the 1920s when your   sales entered a dusty repair shop

green felt   bad he would carefully place a gleaming   set of new snap-on tools the founders of   this company wanted their customers to   know that the tools of the mechanic were   just as important as the tools of the   doctor the dentist the politician or the   business leader and that his craft was a   noble noble craft   as Noble as any this is a wonderful   story about your company and its   Wisconsin heritage and Wisconsin has a   truly great heritage and it's led by   incredible people but it's also a story   that tells us a lot about the American   spirit in America we honor work we

disappeared innocence locked in   prisons and believe is persecuted for   preaching the Word of God you watched   the women in white bruised bloodied and   captured on their way from mass you have   heard the chilling cries of loved ones   or the cracks of firing squads piercing   through the ocean breeze not a good   sound   among the courageous Cuban dissidents   with us on stage here today are

have witnessed   communism destroy a nation just as   communism has destroyed every single   nation where it has ever been tried but   we will not be silent in the face of   communist oppression any longer you have   seen the truth you have spoken the truth   and the truth has now called us this   group called us to action thank you last   year I promise to be a voice against   repression in our region remember   tremendous repression and a voice for   the freedom of the Cuban people you   heard that pledge you exercised the   right you have to vote you went out and   you voted and Here I am like I promised   like I   I promise you I keep my promises   [Applause]   sometimes in politics they take a little   bit longer but we get there we get there   don't we get there you better believe it   Mike we get there thank you thank you   now we keep our promise and now that I   am your president America will expose   the crimes of the Castro regime and   stand with the Cuban people in their   struggle for freedom because we know it   is best for America to have freedom in   our hemisphere whether in Cuba or   Venezuela and to have a future where the   people of each country can live out   their own dreams   for nearly six decades the Cuban people   have suffered under communist domination   to this day Cuba is ruled by the same   people who killed tens of thousands of   their own citizens who sought to spread   their repressive and failed ideology   throughout our hemisphere and who once   tried to host enemy nuclear weapons 90   miles from our shores the Castro regime   has shipped arms to North Korea and   fuelled chaos in Venezuela while   imprisoning innocence it has harbored   cop killers hijackers and terrorists it   is supported human trafficking forced   labor and exploitation all around the   globe   this is the simple truth of the Castro   regime my administration will not hide   from it   excuse it or glamorize it and we will   never ever be blind to it we know what's   going on and we remember what happened   on my recent trip overseas I said the   United States is adopting a principal   grill ISM rooted in our values shared   interests and common sense I also said   countries should take greater   responsibility for creating stability in   their own regions it's hard to think of   a policy that makes less sense then the   prior administration's terrible and   misguided deal with a Castro regime well   you have to say the Iran deal was pretty   bad also at all let's not forget that   beauty they made a deal with the   government that spreads violence and   instability in the region and nothing   they got thank you it nothing they got   they fought for everything and we just   didn't fight hard enough but now those   days are over   now we hold the cards we now hold the   cards the previous administration's   easing of restrictions on travel and   trade does not help the Cuban people   they only enrich the Cuban regime   the profits from investment and tourism   flowed directly to the military the   regime takes the money and owns the   industry the outcome of last   administration's executive action has   been only more repression and they moved   to crush the peaceful democratic   movement therefore effective immediately   I am cancelling the last   administration's completely one-sided   deal with Cuba   [Music]   I am announcing today a new policy just   as I promised during the campaign and I   will be signing that contract right at   that table in just a moment our policy   will seek a much better deal for the   Cuban people and for the United States   of America we do not want US dollars to   prop up a military monopoly that   exploits and abuses the citizens of Cuba   [Music]   our new policy begins with strictly   enforcing US law we will not lift   sanctions on the Cuban regime until all   political prisoners are freed freedoms   of assembly and expression are respected   all political parties are legalized and   free and internationally supervised   elections are scheduled elections   we will very strongly restrict American   dollars flowing to the military security   and intelligence services that are the   core of the Castro regime they will be   restricted we will enforce the ban on   tourism we will enforce the embargo we   will take concrete steps to ensure that   investments flow directly to the people   so they can open private businesses and   begin to build their country's great   great future a country of great   potential   my action today bypasses the military   and the government to help the Cuban   people themselves for businesses and   pursue much better lives we will keep in   place two safeguards to prevent Cubans   from risking their lives to unlawful   travel to the United States they are in   such danger the way they have to come to   this country and we are going to be   safeguarding those people we have to   have no choice we have to and we will   work for the day when a new generation   of leaders brings this long reign of   suffering to an end and I do believe   that end is in the very near future we   challenge Cuba to come to the table with   a new agreement that is in the best   interests of both their people and our   people and also of Cuban Americans to   the Cuban government I say put an end to   the abuse of dissidents release the   political prisoners stop jailing   innocent people open yourselves to   political and economic freedoms return   the fugitives from American justice   including the return of the cop killer   Joanne Chesimard   you   and finally hand over the Cuban military   criminals who shot down and killed four   brave members of brothers to the rescue   who were in unarmed small slow civilian   plane those victims included Mario   Filipino jr. and Carlos Costa we are   honored to be joined today by Mario's   parents Miriam and Mario and Carlos's   sister Mirta where are you   [Applause]   those are great those are great great   parents who love their children so much   what they've done is just an incredible   incredible thing what they represent   they did not die in vain what they   represent to everybody and especially to   the Cuban people so your children did   not die in vain believe   so to the Castro regime I repeat the   harboring of criminals and fugitives   will end you have no choice it will end   any changes for the relationship between   the United States and Cuba will depend   on real progress toward these and the   other goals many of which I've described   when Cuba is ready to take concrete   steps to these ends we will be ready   willing and able to come to the table to   negotiate that much better deal for   Cubans for Americans much better deal   and a deal that's fair a deal that's   fair and a deal that makes sense our   embassy remains open in the hope that   our countries can forge a much stronger   and better path America believes that   free independent and sovereign nations   are the best vehicle for human happiness   for health for education for safety for   everything we all accept that all   nations have the right to chart their   own paths and I'm certainly a very big   believer in that so we will respect   Cuban sovereignty but we will never turn   our backs on the Cuban people that will   not happen   over the years a special sympathy has   grown between this land of the free and   the beautiful people of that island so   close to our shores and so deeply woven   into the history of our region   America has rejected the Cuban people's   oppressors they are rejected officially   today they are rejected and to those   people America has become a source of   strength and our flag a symbol of hope I   know that is exactly what America is to   you and what it represents to you it   represents the same to me it represents   the same to all of us and that is what   it was to a little boy Luis Zaza you   ever hear of Luis became very famous   great talent just eight years old when   Fidel Castro seized power at the time   Louis's father was the police chief in   Santiago de Cuba   you know Santiago yeah oh they know that   there you just days after Fidel took   control his father was one of 71 Cubans   executed by firing squad near San Juan   Hill at the hands of the Castro regime   Luis buried his grief in his great love   of music he began playing the violin so   brilliantly and so beautifully   soon the regime saw his incredible gift   and wanted to use him for propaganda   purposes when he was 12 they organized a   national television special and demanded   he play a solo for Raul Castro who by   the way is leaving now I wonder why   they sent an official to fetch Lewis   from his home but Lewis refused to go   and a few days later Castro soldiers   barged into his orchestra practice area   guns blazing they told him to play for   them terrified Lewis began to play and   the entire room was stunned by what they   heard ringing out from the trembling   boys violin was a tune they all   recognized this young Cuban boy was   playing the star-spangled banner   Louise played the American national   anthem all the way through and when he   finished the room was dead silent when   we say that America stands as a symbol   to the world a symbol of freedom and a   symbol of hope that is what Louise meant   and that is what Louise displayed that   day was a big day it was a great day and   that is what we will all remain that was   a very important moment just like this   is now for Cuba a very important moment   America will always stand for liberty   and America will always pray and cheer   for the freedom of the Cuban people now   that little boy whose story I just told   you the one who played that violin so   beautifully so many years ago is here   with us today   in our very very packed and extremely   warm auditorium   of course he is no longer a little boy   but a world renowned violinist and   conductor one of the Great's and today   he will once again play his violin and   fill the hearts of all who love and   cherish Cuba the United States and   freedom I would like now to invite Luis   to the stage Luis   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   [Laughter]   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   Thank You Louise I just said so where   were you more nervous today or then he   said honestly I think today that's   pretty Thank You Louise that was   beautiful so I want to thank Miami   I want to thank little have on ah Havana   we love do we love it would you move   anywhere else you wouldn't move to Palm   Beach would you no no one little Havana   and I want to thank all of our great   friends here today you've

God bless the United   States of America and God bless you all   thank you now I'm going to sign thank   you   [Applause]   [Music]   so this says Klaus   strengthening the policy of the United   States toward Cuba and I can add   strengthening a lot so this is very   important and you watch what's going to   happen it's going to be a great day for   Cuba thank you thank you very where is

House our two nations share much   in common including our desire for   security prosperity and peace we just   concluded a productive meeting with the   German and American companies to discuss   workforce development and vocational   training very important words Germany   has done an incredible job training the   employees and future employees and   employing its manufacturing and   industrial workforce it's crucial that   we provide our American workers with a   really great employment outlook and that   includes making sure that we harness the   full potential of women in our economy   my administration is in the process of   rebuilding the American industrial base   a stronger America is in the interest   believe me of the world as a whole I   reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my   strong support for NATO as well as the   need for our NATO allies to pay their   fair share for the cost of the   yes many nations Oh vast sums of money   from past years and it is very unfair to   the United States these nations must pay   what they owe during our meeting I   thanked Chancellor Merkel for the German   government's commitment to increase   defense spending and work toward   contributing at least 2% of GDP I want   to thank the Chancellor for her   leadership in supporting NATO and its   efforts in Afghanistan this has come at   significant cost including the lives of   over 50 German soldiers who sacrifice we   greatly honor I also appreciate   Chancellor Merkel's leadership along   with the French President to resolve the   conflict in Ukraine where we ideally   seek a peaceful solution most   importantly our two countries must   continue to work together to protect our   people from radical Islamic terrorism   and to defeat Isis I applaud Chancellor   Merkel for Germany's contributions both   civilian and military as a Counter isis   coalition member we also recognize that   immigration security is national   security we must protect our citizens   from those who seek to spread terrorism   extremism and violence inside our   borders immigration is a privilege not a   right   and the safety of our citizens must   always come first   without question over lunch the   Chancellor and I will talk about our   economic partnership we must work   together towards fair and reciprocal   trade policies that benefit both of our   peoples millions of hardworking US   citizens   have been left behind by international   commerce and together we can shape a   future where all of our citizens have a   path to financial security the United   States will respect historic   institutions and we will also recognize   the right of free people to manage their   own destiny the close friendship between   America and Germany is built on our   shared values we cherish individual   rights we uphold the rule of law and we   seek peace among nations our alliance is   a symbol of strength and cooperation to   the world it is the foundation of a very   very hopeful future thank you to get up   mr. president ladies and gentlemen it is   a great pleasure and privilege to be   here today in the White House together   with President Donald Trump and have a   first personal one-on-one meeting and in   exchange of views in the period leading   up to this visit I've always said it's   much much better to talk to one another   and not about one another and I think   our conversation proved this we talked   about the international situation we   talked about also apprenticeship   programs when we met with CEOs and   apprentices around a round table as   regards the shared interests that we   have I let me look back into the past we   the Germans owe a lot to the United   States of America particularly as   regards the economic rise of Germany   this was primarily due to the help   through the Marshall Plan we were also   able to regain German unity after   decades of the United States standing up   for this together with other allies   and standing by our side during the   period of the Cold War and we are very   gratified to know that today we can live   in peace and freedom as a unified   country due to that so I was gratified   to know that the president underlined   how important he things NATO is NATO is   of prime importance for us and it was   not without very good reason that we   said during our summit meeting in Wales   that also Germany needs to increase   expense expenditure we committed to this   2% goal until 2024 we last year we   increase our defense spending by 8% and   we're going to work together again and   again on this and we said that obviously   defence and security has a lot of   different effort assets and facets to it   on the one hand it's supporting missions   at the in Africa for example it's also   promoting development assistance but   it's also helping missions in Africa for   example in trying to stand up for their   own safety and security we continue to   be in conversation what was important   for us today was that we were able to   talk about Afghanistan and talk about   what as a president quite rightly said   the continuing mission in of Germany in   Afghanistan I am very glad that the   United States are intending to continue   to commit to the Afghan mission as well   together we fight against Islamist   terrorism Germany is going to step up   its work and is going to continue its   work in Afghanistan and also in Syria   we're going to monitor the situation   there very closely we're going to work   on political situation and the solutions   in Syria but also in Libya what we   talked about   I am very gratified to know that the   American administration and also the   president personally commit themselves   to the Minsk process we need to come to   a solution of this problem there has to   be a safe and secure solution for a   Ukraine but the relationship with Russia   has to be improved as well once the   situation there on the ground is   clarified Minsk is a good basis but   unfortunate we haven't made yet they had   way that we want to but we are going to   work together   with our experts in the next few months   to come on this issue I am also here in   my capacity as g20 president you know   that we will be hosting the g20 visit   then the g20 summits are in this year   and I'm very pleased that the president   has committed to addressing to us   attending this summit we're going to   talk at some length over lunch about the   issues and we say this has trade has to   be rendered fairer there has to be a   win-win situation we can talk about the   details of that we've already seen today   when we had an exchange with our CEOs   and also with apprentices what sort of   potential we can tap what's when   potential our two economies have it's   very moving to see particularly meeting   with these young people what sort of   work towards the future is being done by   our companies there so particularly in   this period where we are transiting from   traditional manufacturing to an industry   for dello capacity building skills are   so important incidentally not only for   young people but also for those who   maybe have lost their jobs and need to   be rescaled in order to find a job again   and that is an issue I know it's very   important for you here in the United   States but it's also important for us in   Germany so I can say there are a number   of issues where we will continue to   cooperate very closely on the level of   our experts but also in our level we had   a very good first exchange of views so   I'm very much looking forward to the   talks we will have over lunch thinking   thank you very much we'll do a couple of   questions mark halpern   a lot of Americans now have a value like   here we go here it's what to do about   health care so I wanted to tell people   for your bottom lines or what's not   attached to that thing no one's not   helping 40 the gentleman needs to use a   microphone those bottom line in the   detail man that's you president trucks   got different style than to look recent   past met for everything   wondering what you think of that time   did you think it's good for the world   or if you value it thank you mark we   just have a really wonderful group of   people meeting later we met with twelve   pretty much knows in Congress you saw   that little while ago and they went from   all nose to all yeses and we have a lot   of yeses coming and it's all coming   together we're going to have great   healthcare it's going to be passed I   believe I think substantially pretty   quickly it's coming together beautifully   you have the conservative groups you   have other groups everybody wants   certain things in the end we're going to   have a great health care plan now I have   to tell you that Obamacare is a disaster   it's failing I was in Tennessee we had a   tremendous crowd the other night and   they have half of the state is uncovered   the insurance companies have left and   the other half has one insurance company   that will probably be bailing out pretty   soon also they have nobody   you have many states where they have one   and you have a lot of places now where   they'll have none Obamacare will fail it   will fold it will close up very very   soon if something isn't done I've often   said politically the best thing I can do   is absolutely nothing wait one year and   then even the Democrats will come say   please please you got to help us but   it's not the right thing to do for the   people we have a great plan we have a   plan that's getting more and more   popular with the Republican base with   the conservative base and with people   generally the press has covered it very   inaccurately people are truly covered   well and I think it's going to be   something that's going to be a model to   be looked upon   I'll tell you after we're finished   yeah tanker soon thank you very much um   well I'm here as Chancellor of the Fed   Republic of Germany I represent German   interests I speak with the President of   the United States who well stands up for   as is Right American interests of his   our task respectively and I must say   that I was very gratified to know the   very warm and gracious hospitality with   which I been received here we held a   conversation while we were trying to   address also those areas where we   disagree but to try to bring people   together try to show what is our vantage   point what is the American vantage point   and then try to find a compromise which   is good for both sides because we need   to be fair with each other each and   everyone is expecting for his or her   leader that something good comes out of   it for of their own people for Germany I   can say what people are different people   have different abilities have different   characteristic their traits of character   have different origins have found their   way into politics along different   pathways and which well that is   diversity which is good sometimes it's   it's difficult to find compromises but   that's what we've been elected for if   everything just went like that with that   problem we you didn't need politicians   to do these jobs for once miss Downes   please kosuna dunes from the German   press agency madam Chancellor given the   experience of the GDR you are always   saying that you are so confident that   walls can fall also for how dangerous do   you think this isolationist policy of   the US president is what was the import   terrorists that his plans and also with   the fact that he doesn't think the EU   doesn't deal with the do you and in a   very respectful way and a mr. president   America first don't you think that this   is going to weaken also the European   Union and why are you so scared of   diversity in the news and in the media   that you speak so often of a fake news   and that things after all in the out in   the end cannot be proven for example the   fact that you have Ben Wyatt up by mr.   Obama   nice friendly reporter first of all I   don't believe in an isolationist policy   but I also believe a policy of trade   should be a fair policy and the United   States has been treated very very   unfairly by many countries over the   years and that's going to stop but I'm   not an isolationist I'm a free trader   but I'm also a fair trader and our free   trade has led to a lot of bad things   happening you look at the deficits that   we have and you look at all of the   accumulation of debt we're a very   powerful company country we're a very   strong very strong country will soon be   at a level that we perhaps have never   been before   our military is going to be strengthened   it's been depleted but I am a trader I   am a fair trader I am a trader that   wants to see good for everybody   worldwide but I am NOT an isolationist   by any stretch of the imagination so I   don't know what newspaper you're reading   but I guess that would be another   example of as you say fake news okay I   victus inform eyes'll well allow me if I   may to put it in the following terms we   haven't yet had time to talk at a great   length about economic issues but I would   so say that the success of Germany in   the economic area but also on security   and peace and that the success of   Germans have always been one where the   German success is one side of the coin   and the other side of the coin has been   European unity and unity and European   integration that's something of which   I'm deeply convinced and I'm not only   saying this back home I'm saying this   here I'm saying it in the United States   and also here in Washington in my talks   with the president secondly I believe   that globalization or to be shaped in an   open-minded way but also in a very fair   way freedom of movement within the   European Union for example is a very   important element of our economic   progress of peace   been for many many decades the European   countries for many many centuries wage   wars against each other we have to   protect our external borders because and   there we have to work in on the basis of   mutual interest with our neighbors   migration immigration integration has to   be worked on obviously traffickers have   to be stopped but this has to be done   while looking at the refugees as well   giving them opportunities to shape their   own lives where they are help countries   who right now are not in an ability to   do so sometimes because they have civil   war I think that's the right way of   going about it and this is obviously   what we have an exchange of views about   but my position is the one that I've   just set out for you I might add that we   have many plants and factories coming   back into the United States many jobs   are coming back to Michigan to Ohio to   Pennsylvania to a lot of places where   they were losing jobs and we will have a   different policy but it's going to be a   great policy for not only the United   States but a great policy worldwide and   I look very much forward to it Kevin   surelly yes   [Music]   [Music]   what you do   well Kevin I think we have a very   unified Republican Party after all we   have the presidency we have the house we   have the Senate and we're getting along   very well I will tell you and if you   would have were at the meeting that I   just attended where we took 12 nose or   semi nose know yeses and within a short   period of time everybody was very much   on board and a commitment to vote yes I   think we have a very unified party take   actually more unified than even the   election you see when they they talk   about me I seem to be very popular at   least this week within the party because   we have our highest numbers the highest   numbers that I've ever had in the party   so I think there's a great unification   health care is a very very difficult   subject it's a very complex subject and   it's a subject that you know goes both   ways you do something for one side and   the other side doesn't like it but it's   really something that's come together   very well and I think it's going to be   very very popular extremely popular on   trade with Germany I think we're going   to do fantastically well right now I   would say that the negotiators for   Germany have done a far better job than   the negotiators for the United States   but hopefully we can even it out we   don't want victory we want fairness all   I want is fairness Germany has done very   well in its trade deals with the United   States and I give them credit for it but   and I can speak to many other countries   when you look at China you look at   virtually any country that we do   business with it's not exactly what you   call good for our workers when you look   at the horrible NAFTA transaction NAFTA   has been a disaster for the United   States it's been a disaster for   companies and in particular it's been a   disaster for the workers a lot of the   companies just moved but the workers are   screwing probably the reason I'm   standing here may be number one that and   maybe the military building up our   military which we will do and we will be   stronger than ever before and hopefully   not have to use it   but we will be stronger and perhaps far   stronger than ever before but it's   probably the reason I'm here is when you   talk about trade so I think that we are   going to be a very different country I   think we're going to be I'm going to   have great values but in terms of our   military it's going to be much stronger   and our trade deals are going to be good   solid deals not deals that lead to   closing plants and tremendous   unemployment okay thank you ma'am   then vo hundreds up when we speak about   trade agreements then the European Union   is negotiating those agreements for all   of the member states of the European   Union but obviously there's also input   by the member states they bring to the   table what's important to them   we have underlined as and German   industry gem business community and have   made the experience that any kind of   agreement that we have concluded for   example at the very latest and with   South Korea brought us more jobs   actually people were very much concerned   about losing jobs for example yote   emotive industry but in the end turned   up particularly as regards South Korea   in the end it turned out that both sides   benefited and I think it's only fair   that's the purpose of concluding   agreements that both sides win and that   is the sort of spirit I think in which   we ought to be guided in negotiating any   agreement between the United States of   America and the URI hope that we can   resume and the agreement that we started   we have just now concluded our agreement   with Canada and I hope that we will come   back to the table and talk about the   agreement between you and the US again   mr. Graf please Thank You Oscar Graf   from de Velde   Madame Chancellor a question addressed   to you today we're talking about a trade   the president in the past always said   that mum he doesn't like multilateral   trade agreements but prefers bilateral   trade agreements do you think from the   EU point of view TTIP is a bilateral   agreement with   washing on one side the you on the other   side now is the problem a that America   the President of the United States and   the Europeans have a basically different   understanding of what the EU is all   about that's my question address to you   and mr. president my question addressed   to you from a rejected White House   claims is that the elite wiretapping on   on you on the Trump Tower on Trump   organization or on members of your   campaign was that British intelligence   was either responsible for it or   involved in it and after these claims   are rejected what is your take on that   are there other suspects or do you think   it was it was a mistake to blame British   intelligence for this end by the way my   second question are there from time to   time that tweets that you regret in   inside very seldom very seldom as you   would have so you never would ever you   know not to have probably wouldn't be   here right now but so very seldom we   have a tremendous group of people that   listen and I can get around the media   when the media doesn't tell the truth so   I like that as far as a wiretapping I   guess by you know this past   administration at least we have   something in common perhaps   and just to finish your question we said   nothing all we did was quote a certain   very talented legal mind who was the one   responsible for saying that on   television I didn't make an opinion on   it that was a statement made by a very   talented lawyer on Fox and so you   shouldn't be talking to me you should be   talking to Fox okay thank you yeah   global does their president well I   believe that the president has clearly   set out his philosophy as to what traded   winds have to bring about for the   American side as well I personally don't   think that Germany needs to negotiate   and not the European Union we've   devolved our competences to the European   Union's of the European Union or rather   the Commission negotiates on behalf of   the Member States so that's not going to   prevent us from concluding agreements   for me indeed this would be then qualify   as a bilateral agreement between the EU   and the United says if we had it but the   question is will it be of benefit to   both countries or not and let me be very   honest very candid a free trade   agreement with the United States of   America has not always been all that   popular in Germany either there have   been less demonstrations against this   vie trade agreement in the United States   than in Europe and also in Germany so I   am very glad to note that apparently the   sort of perspective on that has changed   a little bit at least in Germany too   thank you very much great honor thank   you thank you   [Music]   you   you
POf6MKGU6fI~Trump TV Network~20170609~President Donald Trump Speech at the Department of Transportation 6/9/17~3922.0~4.82822084427~156.0~7.0~   [Music]   Thank You secretary Chao thank you   everybody   this is very nice by the way beautiful I   want to really thank you you have been   so amazing as the leader of this   department and the progress is being   made so quickly but leaders and   officials gathered here from across the   country have all praised the work that   the secretary is doing to create a safe   modern and reliable transportation   system for the United States and for its   great great great people I also want to   thank secretary Zinke for the fantastic   job he's doing at the Department of the   Interior to clear the way for new   infrastructure and economic development   both secretary Chao NZ joined us at the   White House yesterday for a meeting with   state and local leaders to develop plans   to replace America's decaying   infrastructure and construct new roads   rails pipelines tunnels and bridges all   across our nation we are here today to   focus on solving one of the biggest   obstacles to creating this new and   desperately needed infrastructure and   that is the painfully slow costly and   time-consuming process of getting   permits and approvals to build and I   also knew that from the private sector   it is a long slow unnecessarily   burdensome process my administration is   committed to ending these terrible   delays once and for all   the excruciating wait time for   permitting has inflicted enormous   financial pain to cities and states all   throughout our nation and has blocked   many important projects from ever   getting off the ground many many   projects are long gone because they   couldn't get permits and there was no   reason for it we've already taken   historic steps to speed up the approvals   including the approval of the Keystone   XL pipeline which was very quickly   approved they were sitting there for a   long time saying well that project is   dead then I came into office and all of   a sudden a miracle and I guarantee you   the consultants went over to the heads   of the company and told them what a   great job they did they asked for a lot   of money most likely but we got it   approved and we got it approve fast I'm   also very proud to say that the Dakota   access pipeline is now officially open   for business it was dead 120 days ago   and now it officially just opened for   business very proud of that   i bill   we're also excited to be joined by   representatives from our labor unions   including the North American Building   Trades Union which I know well and the   laborers International Union of North   America   you will play go ahead fellas take a   little credit come on fellas you will   play a central role in rebuilding   America very important we're also joined   as well by many distinguished members of   Congress who share our total passion and   desire to repair and restore America's   highways railways and waterways in the   audience is Herman bill hughster of the   House Transportation and Infrastructure   Committee stand up thank you Bill great   job   who is working very closely with us   including on our proposal to   dramatically reduce airport delays by   reforming air traffic control we have an   obsolete system and I have to say before   Lane got here they said spent close to   seven billion dollars on the system mum   I'll waste all wasted but we're going to   have a great system great new system the   top of the line it'll be the best in the   world   right now we're at the lowest part of   the pact will be the best in the world   for a lot less money than they've been   wasting for years for too long America   has poured trillions and trillions of   dollars into rebuilding foreign   countries while allowing our own country   the country that we love and its   infrastructure to fall into a state of   total disrepair   we have structurally deficient bridges   clogged roads crumbling dams and locks   our rivers are in trouble our railways   are aging and chronic traffic that slows   commerce and diminishes our citizens   quality of life other than that we're   doing very well instead of rebuilding   our country Washington has spent decades   building a dense thicket of rules   regulations and red tape it took only   four years to build the Golden Gate   Bridge in five years to build the Hoover   Dam and less than one year to build the   Empire State Building people don't   believe that took less than one year but   today it can take 10 years and far more   than that just to get the approvals and   permits needed to build a major   infrastructure project these charts   beside me are actually a simplified   version of our highway permitting   process it includes 16 different   approvals involving 10 different federal   agencies being governed by 26 different   statutes as one example and this   happened just 30 minutes ago I was   sitting with a great group of people   responsible for their state's economic   development and roadways all of you are   in the room now and one gentleman from   Maryland was talking about a 18 Mile   Road and he brought with him some of the   approvals that they've gotten it paid   for they spent 29 million dollars for an   environmental report weighing 70 pounds   and costing $24000 per page and I said   do me a favor I'm going to make a speech   in a little while do you mind if I take   that and show it so I'm going to show it   okay   [Applause]   I better make sure I move it I don't   want to trip on the way out that would   be a big story especially the trip over   that so they spent millions and millions   of dollars when I said how long is this   short roadway been talked about the   gentleman said well if you say 20 years   you're safe I said you don't say anymore   because I have to be you know I have to   be exactly accurate with these people   thank you I was off by like two months   it's a major front page story but these   binders on the stage could be replaced   by just a few simple pages and it'd be   just as good it would actually be much   better because these binders also make   you do unnecessary things that costs   billions and billions of dollars and   they actually make it worse as another   example the 23 if you look at it in Ohio   the Ohio River Bridge two point three   billion dollars a project amassed a 150   thousand page administrative record   150000 pages is a five-story tall   building think of it if you put the   paper together   it's a five-story building how can a   country prosper under this kind of   nonsense   and I know it I know it's a well being   in the private sector but you know in a   private sector you move and your wheel   and you deal and you hope and you pray   and maybe it goes a little faster but   it's a horrible thing in the private   sector also and we're talking about   reducing that for the private sector   likewise   why should we continue to accept what is   so clearly unacceptable oftentimes for   consultants that are making a fortune   because you can't do anything without   hiring them paying them a tremendous   amount of money having them write up   this nonsense you can't get approvals   and there in the case of New York Albany   they go to Albany the state capital or   here they go to Washington for federal   and they want to make it really tough   because that way you have to hire them   it's a terrible thing it's a group of   people probably nobody's ever heard   anybody talk about it because I know   because I'm a business guy I understand   it they work really hard to make it   difficult and some are believers but   most aren't most want to make a lot of   money so they make a very very simple   roadway or whatever you want to be   building a very complicated subject and   they make it very much more expensive   and they make it worse it's not as good   as it would have been I was not elected   to continue a failed system I was   elected to change it all of us in   government service were elected to solve   the problems that have plagued our   nation we are here to think big to act   boldly and to rise above the petty   partisan squabbling of Washington DC we   are here to take action it's time to   start building our country with American   workers and with American iron and   aluminum and steel it's time to put up   soaring new infrastructure that inspires   pride in our people and our town   when I approved the Keystone pipeline I   said where was the pipe made   unfortunately they had purchased a lot   of it but I put a little clause at the   bottom you want to build a pipeline in   this country by American steel and let   it be fabricated here   very simple little clause written in   hand but it does the trick it is time at   last to put America first Americans   deserve the best infrastructure anywhere   in the world they deserve roads and   bridges that are safe to travel and   pipes that deliver clean water into   their homes not like what happened in   Flint Michigan they deserve lanes of   Commerce that get people and products   where they need to go on time most of   all Americans deserve a system of   infrastructure that is looked upon not   with pity the world in many cases is so   far advanced that they look at our   infrastructure as being sad we want them   to look at us with envy a system worthy   of our magnificent country no longer can   we allow these rules and regulations to   tie down our economy chained up our   prosperity and SAP our great American   spirit that is why we will lift these   restrictions and unleash the full   potential of the United States of   America to all of our state and local   leaders I appreciate your being here   today thank you thank you thank you Bill   I want you to know that help is finally   after many many decades on its way we   are giving control back to the cities in   the States   you know best how to plan your   communities analyze your projects and   protect your local environment we will   get rid of the redundancy and   duplication that wastes your time and   your money our goal is to give you one   point of contact to deliver one decision   yes or no for the entire federal   government and to deliver that decision   quickly whether   it's a road whether it's a highway a   bridge a dam to do this we are setting   up a new council to help project   managers navigate the bureaucratic maze   this council will also improve   transparency by creating a new online   dashboard allowing everyone to easily   track major projects through every stage   of the approval process this council   will make sure that every federal agency   that is consistently delaying projects   by missing deadlines will face tough new   penalties I know it won't happen with   these two we have to worry about them we   will hold the bureaucracy accountable   we're also creating a new office in the   Council of Environmental Quality to root   out inefficiency clarify lines of   authority and streamline federal and   state local procedures so that   communities can modernize their aging   infrastructure without fear of outdated   federal rules getting in their way this   massive permit reform and that's what it   is it's a permit reform doesn't sound   glamorous they won't write stories about   it they won't even talk about it but   it's so important but it's only the   first step in renewing America's roads   rails runways and rivers as I discussed   in Ohio recently my new vision for   American infrastructure will generate 1   trillion dollars in infrastructure   investment which we desperately need   we've spent as of a few months ago six   trillion dollars in the Middle East   think of it six trillion dollars in the   Middle East and it's worse than it was   15 years ago by a factor of 10 and yet   if you want to build a little road in   one of your communities in Pennsylvania   or   Ohio or in Iowa or North Carolina or in   Florida you can't get the money state   and local leaders will have more power   to decide which projects get built when   they start and how they are funded and   investors will have a much more   predictable environment that encourages   them to invest billions of dollars in   capital that is currently stuck on the   sidelines together we will build   projects to inspire our youth employ our   workers and create true prosperity for   our people we will pour new concrete lay   new brick and watch new sparks light our   factories as we Forge metal from the   furnaces of our Rust Belt and our   beloved Heartland which has been   forgotten it's not forgotten anymore   we will put new American steel into the   spine of our country American workers   will construct Leeming new lanes of   Commerce across our landscape they will   build these monuments from coast to   coast and from city to city and with   these new roads bridges airports and   seaports we will embark on a wonderful   new journey into a bright and glorious   future we will build again we will grow   again we will thrive again and we will   make America great again thank you god   bless you I appreciate it thank you very   much thank you   thank you   you

for his unwavering   commitment of the American people it is   now my high honor and distinct privilege   to introduce to all of you the President   of the United States of America   president Donald Trump   [Applause]   thank you very much thank you I would   like to begin by addressing the   terrorist attack in Manila we're closely   monitoring the situation and I will   continue to give updates anything   happens during this period of time but   it is really very sad as to what's going   on throughout the world with terror our   thoughts and our prayers are with all of   those affected before we discuss the   Paris Accord I'd like to begin with an   update on our tremendous absolutely   tremendous economic progress since   election day on November 8th the economy   is starting to come back and very very   rapidly we've added three point three   trillion dollars in stock market value   to our economy and more than a million   private-sector jobs I've just returned   from a trip overseas where we concluded   nearly 350 billion dollars of military   and economic development for the United   States creating hundreds of thousands of   jobs it was a very very successful trip   believe me thank you   thank you in my meetings at the g7   we have taken historic steps to demand   fair and reciprocal trade that gives   Americans a level playing field   against other nations we're also working   very hard for peace in the Middle East   and perhaps even peace between the   Israelis and the Palestinians our   attacks on terrorism are greatly   stepped-up and you see that you see it   all over from the previous   administration including getting many   other countries to make major   contributions to the fight against   terror big big contributions are being   made by countries that weren't doing so   much in the form of contribution one by   one we are keeping the promises I made   to American people during my campaign   for president whether it's cutting   job-killing regulations appointing and   confirming a tremendous Supreme Court   justice putting in place tough new   ethics rules achieving a record   reduction in illegal immigration on our   southern border we're bringing jobs   plants and factories back into the   United States at numbers which no one   until this point thought even possible   and believe me we've just begun the   fruits of our labor will be seen very   shortly even more so when these issues   and so many more we're following through   on our commitments and I don't want   anything to get in our way I am fighting   every day for the great people of this   country therefore in order to fulfill my   solemn duty to protect America and its   citizens the United States will withdraw   from the Paris climate Accord thank you   [Applause]   thank you but begin negotiations to   re-enter either the Paris Accord or in   really entirely new transaction when   terms that are fair to the United States   its businesses its workers its people   its taxpayers so we're getting out but   we will start to negotiate and we will   see if we can make a deal that's fair   and if we can that's great and if we   can't that's fine as president I can put   no other consideration before the   well-being of American citizens the   Paris climate Accord is simply the   latest example of Washington entering   into an agreement that disadvantages the   United States to the exclusive benefit   of other countries leaving American   workers who I love and taxpayers to   absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs   lower wages shuttered factories and   vastly diminished economic production   thus as of today the United States will   cease all implementation of the   non-binding Paris Accord and the   draconian financial and economic burdens   the agreement imposes on our country   this includes ending the implementation   of the nationally determined   contributions and very importantly the   Green Climate Fund which is costing the   United States a vast fortune   compliance with the terms of the Paris   Accord and the owners energy   restrictions that is placed on the   United States could cost America as much   as 27 million lost jobs by 2025   according to the National Economic   Research Associates this includes four   hundred and forty thousand fewer   manufacturing jobs not what we need   believe me this is not what we need   including automobile jobs and the   further decimation of vital American   industries on which countless   communities rely they rely for so much   and we would be giving them so little   according to the same study by 2040   compliance with the commitments put into   place by the previous administration   would cut production for the following   sectors paper down 12% cement down 23%   iron and steel down 38% coal and I   happen to love the coal miners down 86   percent natural gas down 31% the cost of   the economy at this time would be close   to three trillion dollars in lost GDP   and six and a half million industrial   jobs while households would have $7000   less income and in many cases much worse   than that not only does this deal   subject our citizens to harsh economic   restrictions it fails to live up to our   environmental ideals   as someone who cares deeply about the   environment which I do I cannot in good   conscience support a deal that punishes   the United States which is what it does   the world's leader in environmental   protection while imposing no meaningful   obligations on the world's leading   polluters for example under the   agreement China will be able to increase   these emissions by a staggering number   of years 13 they can do whatever they   want for 13 years not us   India makes its participation contingent   on receiving billions and billions and   billions of dollars in foreign aid from   developed countries there are many other   examples but the bottom line is that the   Paris Accord is very unfair at the   highest level to the United States   further while the current agreement   effectively blocks the development of   clean coal in America which it does and   the mines are starting to open up having   a big opening in two weeks Pennsylvania   Ohio West Virginia in so many places a   big opening of a brand-new mine it's   unheard of for many many years that   hasn't happened they asked me if I'd go   I'm going to try China will be allowed   to build hundreds of additional coal   plants so we can't build the plants but   they can according to this agreement   India will be allowed to double its coal   production by 2020 think of it India can   double their coal production we're   supposed to get rid of ours even Europe   is allowed to continue construction of   coal plants in short the agreement   doesn't eliminate coal jobs it just   transfers those   out of America and the United States and   ships them to foreign countries this   agreement is less about the climate and   more about other countries gaining a   financial advantage over the United   States the rest of the world applauded   when we signed the Paris agreement they   went wild they were so happy for the   simple reason that it put our country   the United States of America which we   all love at a very very big economic   disadvantage a cynic would say the   obvious reason for economic competitors   and they wish to see us remain in the   agreement is so that we continue to   suffer this self-inflicted major   economic wound we would find it very   hard to compete with other countries   from other parts of the world we have   among the most abundant energy reserves   on the planet sufficient to lift   millions of America's poorest workers   out of poverty yet under this agreement   we are effectively putting these   reserves under lock and key taking away   the great wealth of our nation it's   great wealth   it's phenomenal well not so long ago we   had no idea we had such wealth and   leaving millions and millions of   families trapped in poverty and   joblessness the agreement is a massive   redistribution of United States wealth   to other countries at 1% growth   renewable sources of energy can meet   some of our domestic demand but at 3 or   4 percent growth which I expect   we need all forms of available American   energy or our country will be a grave   risk of brownouts and blackouts our   businesses will come to a halt in many   cases and the American family will   suffer the consequences in the form of   lost jobs and a very diminished quality   of life even if the Paris agreement were   implemented in full with total   compliance from all nations it is   estimated it would only produce a   two-tenths of one degree think of that   this much Celsius reduction in global   temperature by the year 2100   tiny tiny amount in fact 14 days of   carbon emissions from China alone   would wipe out the gains from America   and this is incredible statistic would   totally wipe out the gains from   America's expected reductions in the   year 2030 after we have had to spend   billions and billions of dollars lost   jobs closed factories and suffered much   higher energy costs for our businesses   and for our homes as The Wall Street   Journal wrote this morning the reality   is that withdrawing is in America's   economic interest and won't matter much   to the climate the United States under   the Trump administration will continue   to be the cleanest and most   environmentally friendly country on   earth will be the cleanest than have the   cleanest air   we're going to have the cleanest water   we will be environmentally friendly but   we're not going to put our businesses   out of work we're not going to lose our   jobs we're going to grow I'm going to   grow rapidly and I think you just read   it just came out minutes ago the small   business report small businesses as if   just now are booming hiring people one   of the best reports they've seen in many   years I'm willing to immediately work   with Democratic leaders to either   negotiate our way back into Paris under   the terms that are fair to the United   States and its workers or to negotiate a   new deal that protects our country and   it's taxpayers so if the obstructionists   want to get together with me let's make   them non obstructionists we will all sit   down and we will get back into the deal   and we'll make it good and we won't be   closing up our factories and we won't be   losing our jobs and we'll sit down with   the Democrats and all of the people that   represent either the Paris Accord or   something that we can do that's much   better than the Paris Accord and I think   the people of our country will be   thrilled and I think then the people of   the world will be thrilled but until we   do that we're out of the agreement I   will work to ensure that America remains   the world's leader on environmental   issues but under a firm work that is   fair and where the burdens and   responsibilities are equally shared   among the many nations all around the   world   no responsible leader can put the   workers and the people of their country   at this debilitating   and tremendous disadvantage the fact   that the parasteel hamstrings the United   States while empowering some of the   world's top polluting countries should   dispel any doubt as to the real reason   why fahren lobbyists wish to keep our   magnificent country tied up and bound   down by this agreement it's to give   their country an economic edge over the   United States that's not going to happen   while I'm president I'm sorry my job as   president is to do everything within my   power to give America a level playing   field and to create the economic   regulatory and tax structures that make   America the most prosperous and   productive country on Earth and with the   highest standard of living and the   highest standard of environmental   protection our tax bill is moving along   in Congress and I believe it's doing   very well I think a lot of people will   be very pleasantly surprised the   Republicans are working very very hard   we'd love to have support from the   Democrats but we may have to go it alone   but it's going very well   the Paris agreement handicaps the United   States economy in order to win praise   from the very foreign capitals and   global activists that have long sought   to gain wealth at our country's expense   they don't put America first I do and I   always will   [Applause]   the same Nations asking us to stay in   the agreement are the countries that   have collectively cost America trillions   of dollars through tough trade practices   and in many cases lacks contributions to   our critical military alliance you see   what's happening it's pretty obvious to   those that want to keep an open mind at   what point does America get demeaned at   what point do they start laughing at us   as a country we want fair treatment for   its citizens and we want fair treatment   for our taxpayers we don't want other   leaders and other countries laughing at   us anymore and they won't be they won't   be I was elected to represent the   citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris   I promised I would exit or renegotiate   any deal which fails to serve America's   interests many trade deals will soon be   under renegotiation very rarely do we   have a deal that works for this country   but they'll soon be under renegotiation   the process has begun from day one but   now we're down to business   beyond the severe energy restrictions   inflicted by the Paris Accord it   includes yet another scheme to   redistribute wealth out of the United   States through the so called Green   Climate Fund nice name which calls for   developed countries to send 100 billion   dollars to developing countries all on   top of America's existing and massive   foreign aid payments so we're going to   be paying billions and billions and   billions of dollars and we're already   way ahead of anybody else many of the   other countries haven't spent anything   and many of them will never pay one dime   the green fund would likely obligate the   United States to commit potentially tens   of billions of dollars of which the   United States has already handed over 1   billion dollars nobody else is even   close most of them haven't even paid   anything including funds raided out of   America's budget for the war against   terrorism that's where they came believe   me they didn't come from me they came   just before I came into office not good   and not good the way they took the money   in 2015 the United Nations departing top   climate officials reportedly described   the 100 billion dollars per year as   peanuts and stated that the 100 billion   dollars is the tail that wags the dog in   2015 the Green Climate Fund executive   director reportedly stated that   estimated funding needed would increase   to four hundred and fifty billion   dollars per year   after 2020 and nobody even knows where   the money is going - nobody's been able   to say where is it going - of course the   world's top polluters have no   affirmative obligations under the green   fund which we terminate America is 20   trillion dollars in debt cash-strapped   cities cannot hire enough police   officers or fix vital infrastructure   millions of our citizens are out of work   and yet under the Paris Accord billions   of dollars that ought to be invested   right here in America will be sent to   the very countries that have taken our   factories and our jobs away from us so   think of that there are serious legal   and constitutional issues as well   foreign leaders in Europe Asian and   across the world   should not have more to say with respect   to the US economy than our own citizens   and their elected representatives thus   our withdrawal from the agreement   represents a reassertion of America's   sovereignty   [Applause]   our Constitution is unique among all   nations of the world and it is my   highest obligation and greatest honor to   protect it and I will   staying in the agreement could also pose   serious obstacles for the United States   as we begin the process of unlocking the   restrictions on America's abundant   energy reserves which we have started   very strongly it would once have been   unthinkable that an international   agreement could prevent the United   States from conducting its own domestic   economic affairs but this is the new   reality we face if we do not leave the   agreement or if we do not negotiate a   far better deal the risks grow as   historically these agreements only tend   to become more and more ambitious over   time in other words the Paris framework   is just a starting point as bad as it is   not an endpoint and exiting the   agreement protects the United States   from future intrusions on the United   States sovereignty and massive future   legal liability believe me we have   massive legal liability if we stay in as   president I have one obligation and that   obligation is to the American people the   Paris Accord would undermine our economy   hamstring our workers weaken our   sovereignty impose unacceptable legal   risk and put us at a permanent   disadvantage to the other countries   of the world it is time to exit the   Paris Accord and time to pursue a new   deal that protects the environment our   companies our citizens and our country   it is time to put Youngstown Ohio   Detroit Michigan and Pittsburgh   Pennsylvania along with many many other   locations within our great country   before Paris France it is time to make   America great again thank you thank you   thank you thank you very much thank you   very much very important I'd like to ask   Scott Pruett who most of you know and   respect as I do just to say a few words   Scott please   [Applause]   Thank You mr. president your decision   today to exit the Paris Accord reflects   your unflinching commitment to put   America first and by exiting your   fulfilling yet one more campaign promise   to the American people please know that   I'm thankful for your fortitude your   courage and your steadfastness as you   serve and lead our country America   finally has a leader who answers only to   the people not to the special interest   who have had their way for way too long   and everything you do mr. president   you're fighting for the Forgotten men   and women across this country   you're a chant you are a champion for   the hard-working citizens all across   this land who just want a government   that listens to them and represents   their interests you have promised to put   America first and all that you do and   you've done that in any number of ways   from trade to national security to   protecting our border to right-sizing   Washington DC and today you put America   first with regard to international   agreements in the environment this is an   historic restoration of American   economic independence one that will   benefit the working class the working   poor in working people of all stripes   with this action you have declared that   the people or rulers of this country   once again it should be noted that we as   a nation do it better than anyone in the   world in striking the balance between   growing our economy growing jobs while   also being a good steward of our   environment we owe no apologies to other   nations for our environmental   stewardship after all before the Paris   Accord was ever signed America had   reduced its co2 footprint to levels from   the early 1990s in fact between the   years 2000 and 2014 the United States   reduces carbon emissions by 18 plus   percent and this was accomplished not   through government mandate but   accomplished through innovation and   technology of American private sector   for that reason mr. president you have   corrected a view that was paramount in   Paris that somehow the United States   should penalize its own economy be   apologetic leave with our chin while the   rest of the world does little other   nations talkig again we lead with action   not words   our efforts mr. president do you know   should be on exporting our technology   our innovation to nations who seek to   reduce their co2 footprint to learn from   us that should be our focus versus   agreeing to unachievable targets that   harm our economy and the American people   mr. president it takes courage it takes   commitment to say no to the plaudits of   men while doing what's right by the   American people you have that courage   and the American people can take comfort   because you have their backs Thank You   mr. president   [Applause]   [Music]   you   [Applause]

professional confirmation   senator Grassley where is Senator   Griffin thank you thank you thank you   senator   finally a profound thank you - Louise   Gorsuch and to all of the Gorsuch family   thank you and Louise I've heard it   firsthand I know what a total   inspiration you are to your husband and   to your entire family so thank you very   much fantastic thank you very much we   are here to celebrate history they're   taking of the judicial oath by the   newest member of the United States   Supreme Court   Neil Gorsuch justice Gorsuch I just want   to congratulate you and your entire   family it's something so special in fact   I've always heard that the most   important thing that a president of the   United States does is appoint people   hopefully great people like this   appointment to the United States Supreme   Court and I can say this is a great   honor   [Applause]   and I got it done in the first 100 days   that's even nice you think that's easy   this ceremony has special meaning as   justice Gorsuch is filling the seat of   one of the greatest Supreme Court judges   in American history and that's Antonin   Scalia who is terrific twas a terrific   judge and a terrific person Justice   Scalia was a patriot who revered our   Constitution he was beloved by many very   many who are here today and he is deeply   missed by all of us I want to at this   time recognize his incredible wife   Maureen who I got to know very well over   the last short period of time and marine   please stand up thank you very much   thank you and your family thank you   thank you Laurie Americans are blessed   to have in Neil Gorsuch a man who will   likewise be a devoted servant of the law   over the past two months the American   people have gotten to know respect and   truly admire our newest member of the   United States Supreme Court injustice   Gorsuch they see a man of great and   unquestioned integrity they see a man of   unmatched qualifications and most of all   and most importantly they see a man who   is deeply faithful to the Constitution   of the United States he will decide   cases based not on his personal   preferences but based on a fair and   objective reading of the law today we   have all three branches of government   represented at this event it is a very   special thing and a very special   happening and it's worth taking just a   minute to remember what it all means   in our founders incredible was they gave   each branch of government a different   role in our great Republic we have a   Congress to write the laws on behalf of   the people we have a president to   enforce those laws and defend our nation   and we have a Supreme Court to apply and   interpret the law in a fair and   impartial manner when disagreements   arise the founders separated power   because they knew it was the best way to   protect our citizens and keep our   Constitution secure justice Gorsuch you   are now entrusted with the sacred duty   of defending our Constitution our   country is counting on you to be wise   impartial and fair you serve under our   laws not over them and to safeguard the   right of the people to govern their own   affairs I have no doubt you will rise to   the occasion and that the decisions you   will make will not only protect our   Constitution today but for many   generations of Americans to come in just   a moment justice Gossage will be sworn   in by Justice Kennedy a great man of   outstanding accomplishment throughout   his nearly 30 years on the Supreme Court   Justice Kennedy has been praised by all   for his dedicated and dignified service   we owe him an enormous debt of gratitude   and I am honored that he is with us   today   this is a very very special moment   because many years ago a young Neil   Gorsuch started his legal career as a   law clerk to Justice Kennedy you   remember that right it is a fitting   testament to Justice Kennedy's impact   that upon giving the oath to Justice   Gorsuch he will become the first-ever   Supreme Court justice to serve with one   of his former law clerks it's sort of a   big deal isn't it sort of like that   that's sort of good it has never   happened before   pretty good it also shows you have a lot   of respect for this man it's very good   we're thrilled to share this historic   moment with Justice Kennedy with all of   you here today and with all Americans   watching us at home Justice Gorsuch I   again congratulate you and your entire   family and I wish God's blessings on   your amazing journey ahead I have no   doubt you will go down as one of the   truly great justices in the history of   the United States Supreme Court I now   invite Justice Kennedy to say a few   words thank you very much   Thank You mr. president mr. chief   justice justice gore Gorsuch and my   fellow adherents to the idea and the   reality of the rule of law as many of   you know there are two oaths that a   member of the federal judiciary must   take the first is the constitutional   oath that so many of you are familiar   with it applies to all three branches of   the government   the second oath is one that applies just   to federal judges both of the oaths date   from the founding of the Republican of   the Republic the judicial oath dates   from 1789 and both of these oaths remind   us that we as a people are bound   together we as a people find our self   definition our respect our heritage and   our destiny in the Constitution and so   the Justice quarters there is one oath   remaining for you to take the judicial   oath before you may receive and accept   your commission from the President of   the United States   are you ready judges Gorsuch to take the   oath   are you ready to take to go justice   would please raise your right hand and   repeat after me   I kneel and Gorsuch do solemnly swear   I kneel Emboar such you solemnly swear   that I will administer justice without   respect to curses now administer justice   without respect the persons and do equal   right to the poor and to the rich and do   equal right to the poor and the rich and   that I will faithfully and impartially   discharge and perform and that I will   faithfully and impartially discharge and   perform all the duties incumbent upon me   all the duties incumbent upon me as   Associate Justice of the Supreme Court   of the United States as Associate   Justice the Supreme Court of the United   States under the Constitution and laws   of the United States are the   Constitution and laws of the United   States so help me God so help me God   congratulations   I see before me so many to whom I owe so   much I know I would not be here today   without your friendship and support   thank you all from the bottom of my   heart I want to thank the president for   nominating me and for the great   confidence and trust he's reposed in me   I want to thank the vice president for   his constant encouragement and

investment in the armed forces of the   United States and show the entire world   that America stands with those who stand   in defense of freedom we have your back   every hour every day now and always that   also means getting our allies to pay   their fair share it's been a very unfair   to us We strongly support NATO we only   ask that all of the NATO members make   their full and proper financial   contributions to the NATO alliance which   many of them have not been doing many of   them have not been even close and they   have to do that Central Command and   spent central operations command are at   the very center of our fight against   radical Islamic terrorism America stands   in awe of your courage though serving at   CENTCOM have bravely fought across the   theater of war in the Middle East and   bravely battled a vicious enemy that has   no respect for human life today we   express our gratitude to everyone   serving overseas including all of our   military personnel in Afghanistan socom   has dispatched its legendary warriors to   the most secret sensitive and daring   missions in defense of the United States   of America no enemy stands a chance   against our Special Forces not even a   chance they don't have a chance and   that's the way we're going to keep it   and you're going to be better off   because you're going to have the finest   equipment known to man going to be   better off the proof that our nation has   been blessed by God look no further than   the men and women of the United States   military they are the greatest fighters   and the greatest force of justice on the   face of the earth and that the world has   ever known the challenges facing our   nation nevertheless   are very large very very large Rupp   against an enemy that celebrates death   and totally worships destruction you've   seen that Isis is on a campaign of   genocide committing atrocities across   the world radical Islamic terrorists are   determined to strike our homeland as   they did a 911 as they did from Boston   to Orlando to San Bernardino and all   across Europe you've seen what happened   in Paris and nice all over Europe it's   happening it's gotten to a point where   it's not even being reported and in many   cases the very very dishonest press   doesn't want to report it they have   their reasons and you understand that so   today we deliver a message in one very   unified voice to these forces of death   and destruction America and its allies   will defeat you we will defeat them we   will defeat radical Islamic terrorism   and we will not allow it to take root in   our country we're not going to allow it   you've been seeing what's been going on   over the last few days we need strong   programs so that people that love us and   want to love our country and we'll end   up loving our country are allowed in not   people that want to destroy us and   destroy our country   [Applause]   freedom security and justice will   prevail in his first State of the Union   message President George Washington   wrote that to be prepared for war is one   of the most effectual means of   preserving peace almost 200 years later   as the general general was also speaking   about Ronald Reagan he said that wisdom   comes in three very very strong words   peace through strength I've said it many   times during the campaign speaking in   front of tens of thousands of people at   one sitting and I'd always mention   America first a phrase that you probably   never heard make America great again   anybody out here and peace through   strength the men and women of the United   States military provide the strength to   bring peace to our troubled troubled   times we stand behind you

everywhere we go it's the same old story   so great job and you know we've been   gone for now a long time everywhere I go   but we have been gone for close to nine   days this will be nine days and I

NATO allies here today we have a lot of   them you stationed at the crossroads of   the Mediterranean working side-by-side   with Americans to confront the threats   associated with a tremendous violent   suffering and instability across North   Africa and the Middle East   to every service member from Italy from   a NATO country we want to thank you for   your friendship and for partnering with   us in the fight to defeat terrorism and   protect civilization but I believe it   terrorism is a threat bad threat to all   of humanity   and together we will overcome this   threat we will win

way from Italy to support my   inauguration so today I'm glad to be   here and I traveled a long way to   support you and it's my honor thank you   very much military children also make   great sacrifices for their country and I   want you all to know that America is so   proud of you as you know I was here in   Sicily to attend very important summit   meetings the meeting of the g7 it was a   tremendously productive meeting where i   strengthened america bonds   we have great bonds with other countries   and with some of our closest allies we   concluded a truly historic week for our   country our travels took us to some of   the holiest sites in the three Abrahamic   religions and two gatherings of both   America's oldest and newest friends we   traveled the world to strengthen   long-standing alliances and to form a   new partnership among nations devoted to   the task of eradicating   the terrorism that plagues our planet   [Applause]   and we've got the people that can do it   believe me and I am now more hopeful   than ever in the possibility that   nations of it many faiths and from many   religions and from many regions all over   all of them can join together in a   common cause the barbaric attack in   Manchester and the massacre of innocent   young lives underscores the depth of the   evil we face and the urgent need for us   to join forces to absolutely and totally   defeat it I met with Prime Minister May   and expressed the absolute solidarity of   the American people and just yesterday   Coptic Christians in Egypt were   viciously gunned down in another vile   terrorist attack one that took the lives   of beautiful Egyptian children and   others these murderous attacks grieve   ourselves but they also steal and I mean   steal like in steal our resolve together   civilized nations will crush the   terrorists block their funding strip   them of their territory and drive them   out of this earth my first visit during   my travels took me to Saudi Arabia where   I had the honour of participating in a   historic summit with the leaders of more   than 50 Muslim and Arab nations hosted   by King Salman a wise leader who   expressed his strong desire to work with   the United States not only to confront   terrorism but also the extremist   ideology behind terrorism the nations of   the Middle East have endured one   terrorist attack after another and I   called on them to take on the burden of   fighting this evil   that has killed so many innocent Muslims   during this unprecedented gathering we   opened a new center to combat extremist   ideology launched a task force to block   funding for terrorists and agreed to   massive economic development deals the   likes of which there has never been that   will create hundreds of thousands of   jobs in the United States building the   equipment that has just been ordered by   Saudi Arabia we also further isolated   the Iranian regime over its hostile and   destabilizing actions and reaffirmed   that Iran must never be allowed to   obtain under any circumstances a nuclear   weapon I was deeply encouraged to hear   from the leaders of many Muslim and Arab   nations that they are ready to take on a   greater role in combating terrorism and   providing young Muslims in their region   with a future of safety and a future of   opportunity next I went to Jerusalem   where I reaffirmed our unbreakable bond   with the State of Israel there we   continued our discussion about fighting   terrorism and crushing the organizations   and ideologies that drive it I went to   the western wall a monument to the   perseverance of the Jewish people I also   prayed at the Church of the Holy   Sepulchre and walk those sacred halls I   was awed by the majesty and beauty of   the Holy Land and the faith and   reverence of the devoted people who live   there all children from all faiths   deserve a future of hope and peace a   future that does honor to God   I visited Bethlehem a city so precious   to so many and met with the Palestinian   leader President Abbas he assured me he   is willing to reach for peace with   Israel in good faith and I believe he   will and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin   Netanyahu assured me that he too was   ready to reach for peace he's a friend   of mine and he means it from Israel we   came to Italy in Rome I was inspired by   the beauty of st. Peter's Basilica and   even more inspired by meeting with Pope   Francis the great talk it was truly an   honor to meet the Pope and to pray for   peace on those hallowed grounds then I   traveled to two summits with our key   allies first at a NATO summit in   Brussels where we agreed to improve the   burden sharing among members of our   alliance and to further confront the   shared threat of terrorism other member   nations must pay more   [Applause]   the US is currently paying much more   than any other nation and that is not   fair to the United States or the United   States taxpayer so we're working on it   and I will tell you a big difference   over the last year money is actually   starting to pour into NATO from   countries that would not have been doing   what they're doing now had I not been   elected I can tell you that money is   starting to Flora it's only fair to the   United States we want to be treated   fairly and we're behind NATO all the way   but we want to be treated fairly all of   us will be more safe and secure if   everyone fulfills their obligations the   way they're supposed to right   look at this man he's over there he's   agreeing with me a hundred percent most   people agree with it next I attended the   g7 right here in Sicily and made great   progress toward very very vital goals I   laid out my vision for economic growth   and fair trade in support of good-paying   jobs and even great paying middle-class   jobs and more and I called for much   greater security and cooperation on   matters of both terrorism immigration   migration to protect our citizens from   Saudi Arabia to Israel to NATO to the g7   we made extraordinary gains on this   historic trip to advance the security   and prosperity of the United States our   friends and our allies and we paved the   way for a new era of cooperation among   the nations of the world to defeat the   common enemy of terrorism and provide   our children with a much more   hopeful future you're going to have a   great great future you can have a safe   future because of your parents and other   people in this room that is why I knew I   had to conclude my trip right here in   Sigonella with the dedicated service   members who make the future so bright so   proud because I am so proud of the   future you're going to have are you all   proud of the future you're going to have   you better believe it right dad mom   we're all proud of it we're all proud of   it we're proud of our country the men   and women of the United States military   have been the greatest force for peace   and justice in the history of the world   I want you to know that you have a   commander-in-chief who will never ever   forget never ever you will always be   remembered number one just remember that   always   I will give you my complete and   unshakable support we have already made   a historic investment in defense   spending   you've been reading about it because we   believe in pre L and you know this   what's the what's the expression peace   through strength peace through strength   right you'll understand that when you   get a little bit older peace

and really disciplined service men and   women who bravely fight in our name you   not only know the pain of sacrifice but   you also know the tremendous rewards of   military service of being part of   something much larger than even   yourselves you know what it means to be   part of a military team in which men and   women are bound together in a sacred   covenant of trust to serve together to   sacrifice together and to fight together   and by the way and to win together   because you're going to win you're gonna   do a lot of winning you're gonna do a   lot of winning and my pledge to you is   that we will always protect those who   protect us you are protecting us and we   will always remember that and we will   always always protect you Americans   fought and died to liberate Europe from   the evils of nause ISM you know that and   fascism American military power helped   to free the world from the oppression of   communism and today Americans like you   are battling the sinister forces of   terrorism throughout the Middle East   North Africa in the world American   military history is rich with noble   traditions harrowing missions and   selfless heroes like your parents but at   its core the moral of the story is   always the same it is the story of good   overcoming evil you have poured out your   hearts your souls and even your blood   for this nation   and we will pour out our gratitude to   you in return we will show our gratitude   especially this Monday on Memorial Day   when we pause to thank God for the   heroes who have laid down their lives   for our freedom right   [Applause]   among those heroes was a young Navy   sailor from Omaha his name was John   Joseph Paro   Harlan listed in the Navy after the   attack on Pearl Harbor completed   midshipman training at Notre Dame and   soon ended up not far from here in the   waters of the Mediterranean on the night   of July 9th 1943   Paul was among the tens of thousands of   Allied forces preparing for a surprise   landing the next morning on the shores   of Sicily right here about 70 miles away   to be exact   it was to be a major Allied offensive on   European soil and it was important on   his ship cloaked in darkness just six   miles offshore paarl and others noticed   that a smokescreen device had caught   fire in a small boat staged to support   the landings the boat was filled with   explosives he knew that if he didn't   stop the fire an explosion would light   up the night sky alert the enemy all of   his fellow comrades would be killed and   the invasion would be a failure   so Paul rushed to the source of smoke   hardly able to breathe breathing to   smoke in and without a thought for his   own safety picked up the burning device   with his bare hands ran to the side of   the boat and hurled it into the sea as   far as he could throw in that decisive   moment parl didn't hesitate he acted and   in that act he helped ensure the success   not only in the savings of his friends   and those lives but of the Allied   landing   itself which turned out to be a very   very important victory so the Allied   forces went on to win the Sicily   campaign critical in their ultimate   victory was parl but before that final   victory the young brave beautiful sailor   who helped to make it possible   died from the smoke that had damaged his   lung so

a long time he loves   Australia and for the next generation   and thanks also to the legendary   talented golfer Greg Norman I used to   think I was a great player and then I   played with Greg one

very brave souls who   answered the call of freedom also to   Anthony Pratt who just pledged two   billion and that's peanuts for Anthony   if you know anything come on Anthony you   can do better than that ever thank you   thank you very much Anthony that's   beautiful it's really a special   privilege to be back on the intrepid and   to address both American and Australian   heroes milani and I are thrilled to be   joined by a very very special Prime   Minister and his wonderful wife Lucy who   had just gotten to know and you know   they said we had a rough phone call we   really didn't have a rough phone call   did we everyone's talking about this   phone call the media was saying what do   you think about the phone call you   didn't really hang up no we had actually   a very nice call right good now the   record is straight all those people back   there thank goodness it's true we had a   very nice smoke a little testy got a   little bit testy but that's okay we've   had a very good relationship and I'm   very proud of the relationship thank you   very much Malcolm the prime minister and   I have just finished a productive   discussion about the interests of our   two countries together we discussed   crucial issues ranging from   national security to trade to   immigration and enhanced Economic   Cooperation we reaffirm the tremendous   friendship between the United States and   Australia and the vital importance of   our security and our alliance the Armed   Forces of our two nations are operating   side-by-side almost every day fighting   to defeat Isis and the scourge of   terrorism and we will eradicate   terrorism every man and woman who has   served America and Australia in uniform   too proud nations salute you believe me   there is no better place to remember the   importance of military readiness than   this ship it was laid down just one week   before the tragic and the tragedy of   Pearl Harbor and helped secure freedom   in its hour of need I was proud to share   the news that this week my   administration reached a historic deal   with Congress to end the devastating   cuts to the United States military   I don't know what they were thinking   when they started cutting but we've got   it all coming back in big league believe   me it's coming back fast   ordering lots of planes lots of ships   lots of jobs too by the way we will add   more than 25 billion dollars for   national defense in a short period of   time and we will ensure that our service   members have the equipment tools   training and resources that they need   and that they so richly deserve but   security also requires friends that you   can truly count on that is why I was   pleased to meet with Prime Minister   Turnbull and why I'm so glad to be here   with you tonight and we had a great   meeting just a little while ago I want   to thank the American Australian   Association for hosting this event which   I've been contributing to by the way for   years through Rupert   every year he'd send me this letter   could you please give money I say what   do I have to do with that Rupert and I   just keep sending a money money and now   I realize that was money well spent   that's great right Rupert   [Applause]   for years I've been I've been doing my   thing for Rupert and four decades of   work just strengthen the ties between   our two countries they've done a great   job America and Australia are old   friends and really natural partners and   with your help we will remain so for a   very very long time to come our two   nations were born as the rebellious   children of the same parent it's very   interesting statement I've heard that   before till about people and for nearly   a century Americans and Australians have   fought together bled together and died   together as brothers and sisters since   the first world war when Australians led   Americans in the Battle of the home L   now brave warriors have fought shoulder   to shoulder in every major conflict   together their righteous cause has   always been the same the safety of our   citizens and the survival of our freedom   from the beaches of Normandy a vicious   vicious fight to the jungles of Vietnam   and the desert landscapes of the Middle   East where lots of progress believe it   or not after all these years is being   made Americans have had no better   friends than the Australians I mean that   you   we are proudly and profoundly grateful   for Australia's contributions in Syria   Iraq and Afghanistan and their help in   the fight against terrorism following   the terrible attacks of September 11th   on behalf of the United States I thank   the Australian people tonight believe me   I have so many friends here from this   country and we love Australia all of us   we really love Australia thank you very   much   I know there are many active duty   service personnel from both nations with   us in the audience and I want to express   our gratitude to each and every one of   you we are privileged to be joined by   many amazing veterans from our two   countries as well and for really from so   many different conflicts there are so   many conflicts that we fought on and   worked on together and by the way in all   cases succeeded on it's nice to win it's   nice to win and we've won a lot haven't   we mr. prime minister we've won all that   we're to keep it going by the way you've   given your love and loyalty to your   nations and tonight a room of grateful   Patriots says thank you we are   especially honored by the presence   tonight of seven World War two veterans   and we've been talking about them all   night but I should mention their name   once again perhaps for the final time   tonight or we can keep mentioning them   because they're worth it and their names   again John Hancock Derick Holyoke Gordon   Johnson norm taem Wendell Thrasher Roger   Spooner and bill white great great   people   these men stood at the breach in the   battle to save civilization and their   sacrifice kept us free exactly 75 years   ago this week these men saw that   historic battle with their own eyes and   we've also covered that very very   vicious violent battle but this is a   little bit of a different description   but the end result was the same we won   we won they saw enemy planes flying   toward them by the Dozen they saw the   flames erupt into the air and they saw   the true cost of war in the faces of the   heroes that never returned or this   special gathering on this special night   we remember the courage of these men and   every man Australian and American who   fought in the Battle of the Coral Sea   [Music]   the count of the dead goes on and on and   the number of wounded do not even begin   to describe the toughness of the fight   and their incredible sacrifice but   perhaps in the story of just one man we   can hope to get a small glimpse of its   measure it is the story of lieutenant   jack powers a navy flier he grew up just   miles from here in a modest apartment in   Washington Heights right up the road he   then went on to the United States Naval   Academy credible place there his   roommate said of Jack never trust him to   respect conventionalities because he   wasn't a conventional person to put it   mildly   he's a hilarious rebel and his own man   you'll like him and really liked him a   lot but you know what he's just a   different kind of a guy in other words   he was a New Yorker   by the attack on Pearl Harbor   Jack had already served six years in the   Navy in the six months that followed the   Allies suffered many defeats in many   many casualties Japan captured foot   holes all across the Pacific and now was   closing and really fast closing in on   Australia in May 1942 the invasion fleet   moved on Port Moresby the vital base   just a few hundred miles from Australian   shores it was there off the coast that   American and Australian ships met the   enemy in the Coral Sea on the morning of   May 7th Jack powers launched his   Dauntless dive bomber from the depth and   deck of the Yorktown he was some flyer I   can tell you that some great flyer soon   he dives straight at an enemy carrier   and dropped his bomb solo he was almost   caught in the blast and he was badly   hurt but he escaped and the carrier sank   that night on the Yorktown Jack urged   the other pilots to take the same risk   he said that's the way you do it that's   the way you win that's the way you sink   them whatever the cost   even if it costs you your lives that's   the way you sink the ship the next   morning he pressed this point again   remember he said the folks back home are   counting on us I'm going to get a hit if   I have to lay it down right next to that   flight deck in their courage they turned   the tide of the Pacific war they had   tremendous success   they were knocking out ship after ship   that day Jack flew his plane to another   carrier straight into a hail of oncoming   lead and fire to land a devastating blow   on its deck seconds later the colossal   blast the one Jack was talking about and   saying we have to take the risk   engulfed his plane and Jack was gone he   was dead he was brave but what a job he   did some time before Jack died he sent a   wire home to his father in New York had   read dear dad 1000 miles away doesn't   make any difference   you're bad son is thinking of you hoping   that he is worthy of being called a chip   off the old block   his father was a tough cookie also now   it is we who are thinking of jack and   all those brave souls who fought   alongside of him with that incredible   form of attack and especially those who   found their final resting place beneath   the waters where they waged that   greatest of battles they lost their   lives in the fires of war but gained   immortality through their sacrifice and   now 75 years later we hope that we are   worthy of their deeds in the beautiful   beautiful Coral Sea we hope to be worthy   of the sacrifices made by every service   member who has fought in our name past   and present the men who fought the   Second World War saw terrible things   horrible things   deathly things but they also witnessed   spectacular valor and bravery and from   the wreckage of that horrible war they   rebuilt their Nations and launched   civilization to new heights   they knew that together free people can   achieve extraordinary things and that   one hero can make all of the difference   in the world   in those Pacific waters we forged iron   bonds between our two countries few   peoples in the world share ties in   history affection and culture like the   Americans and the Australians few   believe me   [Applause]   those ties were sealed with the blood of   our fathers and grandfathers and those   same ties are now the priceless heritage   we celebrate so beautifully tonight so   with love for our two nations with pride   in our shared history and with faith in   Almighty God we renew our old friendship   and we pledge our lasting partnership in   the search for Prosperity and   everlasting peace mr. prime minister   thank you very much I'm honored that   you're here I'm honored that mrs.   Turnbull is here and I'm honored that   everybody in this room is with us to   realize what a great great relationship   our two nations have together   god bless you god bless our fallen   heroes god bless the Australian people   and god bless the United States of   America thank you all thank you thank   you   thank you very much   [Applause]   please welcome to the stage

President of   the Republic of Colombia   thank you very much it is a great   pleasure to welcome president Santos to   the White House Colombia is one of our   closest allies in the hemisphere and   today we reaffirm partnership between   our two great nations President Santos   and I had a very productive meeting and   we will continue to work very closely   together to bring peace safety and   prosperity to the hemisphere   perhaps no area is really more important   in terms of cooperation than our joint   effort to end the terrible drug crimes   that plagued both of our countries   recently we have seen an alarmed and I   mean really a very highly alarmed an   alarming trend last year Colombia cocoa   cultivation and cocaine production   reached a record high which hopefully   will be remedied very quickly by the   president we must confront this   dangerous threat to our societies   together today I affirm the United   States willingness to assist Colombia's   strategy to target and eliminate drug   trafficking networks illicit financings   cocoa cultivation and cocaine production   of which there is far too much the drug   epidemic is poisoning too many American   lives and we're going to stop it many   different ways one of them will be the   wall my administration is committed to   keeping drugs and gangs from pouring   into our country already border   crossings are down more than 73 percent   secretary kelly is with us he's done a   fantastic job thank you very much mr.   secretary and in short we have a   tremendous group of people working with   us in terms of ice the ice patrol and   the Border Patrol agents they've done a   fantastic job and I'd like you to give   them my highest compliments mr.   secretary   and ms-13 likewise a horrible horrible   large group of gangs that have been let   into our country over a fairly short   period of time are being decimated by   the Border Patrol by ice and by our   incredible local police forces and they   are getting out of our country or in   some cases going directly into prisons   throughout our country but they've   literally taken over towns and cities of   the United States they will be gone very   quickly I look forward to working with   President Santos as we target drug   trafficking both the United States and   Colombia have strong law enforcement and   security relationship we've had it and   especially over the last fairly short   period of time together we will continue   to fight the criminal networks   responsible for the deadly drug trade   that our people have a really strong   commitment to getting rid of because   they want a much brighter future   president Santos and I also discussed   the deteriorating situation in Venezuela   and it is really in a very bad state as   you see as we all see through the media   to stable and peaceful Venezuela is in   the best interest of the entire   hemisphere and America stands with all   of the people in our great hemisphere   yearning to be free we will be working   with Colombia and other countries on the   Venezuela problem it is a very very   horrible problem and from a humanitarian   standpoint it is like nothing we've seen   in quite a long time the United States   and Colombia are also strong economic   partners and we will continue to pursue   trade policies that benefit both of our   peoples the nation's common goals   of protecting our citizens expanding   opportunity and confronting the drug   crisis will improve the lives of our   people and many throughout the region so   many people are being so horribly   affected by what's going on in terms of   violence and in terms of drugs who are   going to take care of the situation and   we both agreed to take care of it   strongly and quickly   president Santos it was an honor to meet   with you and your entire group of   representatives very talented people   indeed who have been working with us and   my representatives and I look forward to   many more productive meetings such as   the one we just had I'd like to thank   you very much for being at the White   House being our guest and I'd like to   congratulate you on winning the Nobel   Peace Prize it's a very great   achievement thank you very much mr.   president I want to thank you personally   for this warm and productive visit and   for the strong support Colombia has   received from your administration from   Congress and from the American people   como se sorry moister Naciones as you   know our nation's have had for a long   time and religious alliance an   extraordinary friendship we believe in   the same principles of democracy freedom   and the rule of law and we work so that   the Western Hemisphere can be more   prosperous and safe the United States   and Colombia they both democracies   operators and long the of longer   standing in the hemisphere we have   supported each other our soldiers fight   shoulder-to-shoulder in the Korean War   or at the request of the United States   we sent anti-drug experts to Afghanistan   and today Colombian the United States   are working together to support Central   America in their fight against drug   cartels and the violence of organized   crime I can say mr. president based on   our conversation this afternoon that I   have no doubt that the United States and   Colombia continued to be today more than   ever a support one for the other   our alliance was strengthened our most   valuable cooperation has been clan   Colombia which I can sum up in very   simple terms   when Colombians were fighting to survive   for our democracy to survive actually   faced with the threat of terrorism and   drug trafficking the United States   stretched out the hand and helped us win   that battle we will never forget it   today we live in a different country   today Colombia is a more peaceful   society a more modern an affair society   in November last year we entered the   longest and lost our conflict existing   in our hemisphere the guerrilla is   putting down weapons at this precise   time to the United Nations   insecurity has come down significantly   today we have the lowest levels of   violence of the last 40 years in at the   same time we have had significant   progress for our citizens initiative   education housing health and social   services millions of Colombians have   been lifted out of poverty Louis today   we continue next to you as partners in   peace Colombia to consolidate peace in   the most affected area Lulu with a   robust support of your government we are   removing thousands of anti-personnel   mines that murdered and mutilated   children women and so there we are   healing the wounds of our victims and we   are embarking on a big social   development program such as we said   today we are working with your   administration to take advantage of the   unique opportunity peace offers so one   to reduce permanently the production of   coca leaf in Colombia and fight more   effectively the other lengths in drug   trafficking including consumption   we must continue and deepen the fight   against organized crime transnational   crime responsible not just for drug   trafficking but also for human   trafficking   and illegal mining wizard our shared   agenda framed within a high-level   dialogue that we Colombians value so   much includes cooperation which has   allowed us to have unprecedented   progress towards quality education for   everyone and this is a priority in the   policies of my government and we wish to   do more with regards to innovation and   technology with the active participation   of the private sector we have waged   trade agreements investment agreements   that are mutually beneficial this   morning we established the   intrapreneurial Council between the   United States and Colombia   we are and wish to continue to be the   best destination in Latin America for   American businesses Colombia will   continue to be very proudly a close   friend and a strategic ally of the   United States dear president Truong I   hope you can visit us soon so that you   can personally witness the   transformation underway   in our country I hope to be able to   welcome you to a Colombia in peace in   more equitable Colombia a better   educated Colombia that you have so much   contributed to thank you so much   thank you very much does anybody have   any questions   I'm shop John go ahead Thank You mr.   president let me get your reaction to   Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen   Stein's decision to appoint a special   counsel to investigate the Russia   Russian interference in the campaign was   this the right move or is this part of a   witch-hunt well I respect the move but   the entire thing has been a witch-hunt   and there is no collusion between   certainly myself and my campaign but I   can always speak for myself and the   Russians zero I think it divides the   country I think we have a very divided   country because of that and many other   things so I can tell you that we want to   bring this great country of ours   together John and I will also say very   strongly we've had tremendous success   you look at our job numbers you look at   what's going on at the border as we   discussed before you look at what will   be happening you're going to see some   incredible numbers with respect to the   success of general mattis and others   with the ISIS situation the numbers are   staggering how successful they've been   the military has been tomorrow as you   know I'm going to Saudi Arabia going to   Israel I'm going to Rome and we have the   g7 we have a lot of great things going   on so I hate to see anything that   divides I'm fine with whatever people   want to do but we have to get back to   running this country really really well   we've made tremendous progress in the   last 100 and some odd days tremendous   bugs and you see job numbers you see all   of the production that's starting plants   starting to open again haven't been open   in years I'm very proud of it that's   what I want to be focused on because   believe me there's no collusion Russia   is fine but whether it's Russia or   anybody else   my total priority believe me is the   States of America so thank you very much   well good all but we have a president   Ron president Santos can we say that   today we are setting a new roadmap in   the relationship between Colombia and   the United States which are they   concrete commitments you are talking   about the post-conflict time many funds   are needed for that and on the issue of   Venezuela president Trump many deaths   human rights violations there's plenty   to be done as well as a very very   serious problem we haven't really seen a   problem like that I would say mr.   president in decades terms of the kind   of violence that we're witnessing the   president was telling me and I knew that   Venezuela was a very very wealthy   country just about the wealthiest in   your neck of the woods and had   tremendous strengths in so many   different ways and now it's it's   poverty-stricken people don't have   enough to eat people have no food   there's great violence and we will do   whatever is necessary and we'll work   together to do whatever is necessary to   help with fixing that and I'm really   talking on a humanitarian level when you   look at the oil reserves that they have   when you look at the potential wealth   that Venezuela has you you sort of have   to wonder why is that happening how is   that possible   but it's been unbelievably poorly run   for a long period of time and hopefully   that will change and they can use those   assets for the good and to take care of   their people because right now what's   happening is really a disgrace to   humanity and John I think you also had a   question for the president if you'd like   to   zeevala wanna meet ya this question   about the commitment Emilia l-l   compromiso   the commitment on president Truong side   and his administration was shown through   the approval of the budget that for   colombia means an increase in the   support to fund the post-conflict era   last night we received from a very   important organization the Atlantic   Council a report which includes both   parties presided by a Republican senator   and a Democrat Senator with the roadmap   recommending the governments of the   United States and Colombia to follow   this morning we established this   entrepreneurial Council United States   Colombia so that the private sector can   also have a voice in that roadmap this   means we are working together on every   front that can be convenient for both   countries we will continue to work   together we have ratified that   commitment today during our conversation   and as I said before we have the best of   relations with the United States we are   strategic allies in the region and we   will continue to be so   Thank You mr. president president Santos   to you you heard president Trump say   that critical to stopping the flow of   drugs into the United States will be the   wall that he wants to build on the   Mexican border do you agree with him   would that wall be a step of a positive   step and step towards reducing the flow   of drugs across the border I believe   that the best way to fight the drug   trafficking is by collaborating this is   not a problem of Colombia only or a   problem of the United States only it's a   world problem and we have to all work   together   we declared the war on drugs 40 years   ago the world declared war on drugs and   it's a war that has not been won so we   must be more effective and more   efficient now we are doing a very big   effort because of the peace process to   have a new strategy carrot and stick   stick by force their education we have   already Radek ated this year only 15000   hectares which is the whole volume that   we eradicated last year and we're   starting to eradicate to substitute   voluntarily through a program where the   peasants and we have 80000 families   already in the program that they are   going to substitute for legal crops and   this is the first time that this could   be done because of the peace before the   conflict did not allow us to build roads   and to give these peasants an   alternative now we have so we have to   take advantage of this opportunity and   continue reducing the production of coca   in the meantime we will work together   the US and Colombia with other countries   Central America to fight the other links   of the chain the intermediaries we have   destroyed 22000 laboratories in the   Colombian jungle seizing the cocaine in   the transit we have seized record amount   of tons last year and this you were   doing even better than last year so by   working together we can be much more   effective and that is that is the   commitment we just made or ratified this   afternoon and that was a long and very   diplomatic answer to your question I   will say it a little bit shorter walls   work just ask Israel they work believe   me they work and we have no choice Peter   Baker yes   Thank You mr. president   in the light of a very busy news week a   lot of people would like to get to the   bottom of a couple of things give you a   chance to go on record here did you at   any time   urge former FBI director James Comey in   any way shape or form to close or to   back down the investigation into Michael   Flynn and also as you will know next   question next question as you look back   over the past six months or year have   you had any recollection where you've   wondered if anything you have done has   been something that might be worthy of   criminal charges in these investigations   or impeachment as some on the left or   implying I think it's totally ridiculous   everybody thinks so and again we have to   get back to work in our country properly   so that we can take care of the problems   that we have we have plenty of problems   we've done a fantastic job we have a   tremendous group of people millions and   millions of people out there that are   looking at what you had just said and   said what are they doing director Comey   was very unpopular with most people   I actually thought when I made that   decision and I also got a very very   strong recommendation as you know from   the Deputy Attorney General Rod   Rosenstein but when I made that decision   I actually thought that it would be a   bipartisan decision because you look at   all of the people on the Democratic side   not only the Republican side that was   saying such terrible things about   director Comey then he had the very poor   performance on Wednesday that was a poor   poor performance so poor in fact that I   believe and you'd have to ask him   because I don't like to speak for other   people but I believe that's why the   deputy attorney general went out and   wrote his very very strong letter and   then on top of that after the Wednesday   performance by director Comey you had a   person come and have to readjust the   record which many people have never seen   before because they were misstatements   made and I thought that was something   that was terrible we need a great   director of the FBI   yeah I cherish the FBI it's special all   over the world no matter where you go   the FBI is special the FBI has not had   that special reputation with what   happened in the campaign what happened   with respect to the Clinton campaign and   even you could say directly or   indirectly with respect to the much more   successful Trump campaign we're going to   have a director who's going to be   outstanding I'll be announcing that   director very soon and I look forward to   doing it I think the people in the FBI   will be very very very very thrilled and   just in concluding we look forward to   getting this whole situation behind us   so that when we go for the jobs we'll go   for the strong military when we go for   all of the things that we've been   pushing so hard and so successfully   including health care because Obamacare   is collapsing it's dead it's gone   there's nothing to compare anything to   because we don't have health care in   this country you just look at what's   happening Aetna just pulled out other   insurance companies are pulling out we   don't have health care Obamacare is a   fallacy it's gone   we need health care we need to cut taxes   we're going to cut taxes forget what I   want it will be the biggest tax cut in   the history of our nation and that's   what I want it's going to bring back   companies it's going to bring back jobs   we lost so many jobs and so many   companies to countries that are not so   far from you mr. president they're very   close to you actually and to many other   places throughout the world we're going   to change that we're going to have   expansion we already do you look at   what's happening with forward and with   General Motors in Michigan and Ohio you   look at the tremendous number of jobs   that are being announced in so many   different fields and that's what I'm   proud of and that's what we want to   focus our energy on the other is   something I can only tell you there was   no collusion and everybody even my   enemies have said there is no collusion   so we want to get back and keep on the   track that we're on because the track   that we're on is record-setting and   that's what we want to do is we want to   break very positive records   thank you you could ask a question we   gotta go sorry you have another question   for you yes sir mr. president my   question is in someone who led a nation   that's really done a lot of rebuilding   and had to rebound from an epidemic of   crime and drugs over quite a many years   what do you make of mr. Trump's America   first policy and further you've had a   tough time with conservative radio   sometimes been called a punching bag and   you said you have to persevere I'm   curious if you've given any advice to   President Trump on how to do so I I   don't think I'm in a position to give   any advice to a president Trump he can   take care of himself and what I what I   what we did in Colombia you quite   rightly mentioned it this persevere we   when you know you're part of the station   and we know you know and you know that   you're doing the correct thing you   simply have to persevere and that's what   we've done in Colombia and that's why we   were on the verge of being a failed   state from years ago and now we're one   of the stars of the region and that's   through hard work perseverance and   clarity of your objectives and that's   what we have done and we have to   continue because the trip is not over   Ricardo I want our list mr. president   I'd like to ask you about trade you are   about to start the renegotiation of   NAFTA and Colombia and like other   countries in the hemisphere has a large   comprised deficit with the United States   are you worried about the fact that that   could contribute to increasing that   Italian position on the peace process in   Colombia well it's been a long process   and it's been a great thing to watch in   the sense that the president did a   fantastic job that's not easy after so   many years of   war so I'm very very proud to get to   know you and I really congratulate you   this nothing tougher than peace and we   want to make peace all over the world   and you are really a great example of   somebody that started   I mean FARC is that was a long tough   situation as you know very well coming   from the country but I think the   president has done a magnificent job not   easy but he's done a magnificent job   math Claro no captain got your comment   clearly impossible on the trade issue   our deficit with the United States is   not so large it is a moderate deficit   which of course both countries will try   to increase the volume of trade in both   directions and investments also in both   directions Colombia is becoming an   important investor here in the United   States and this is something not many   people know but we have considerable   investments in the United States we have   attempted to give dynamism to these   flows of trade of investment getting   together those main players who are the   investors in the private sector I   believe the foundations have been laid   we have the Free Trade Agreement which   is working well the number of Colombian   businesses that are exporting to the   United States has grown and we both   believe that we can take greater   advantage of those agreements in order   to increase flows in both directions for   the benefit growth of the Colombian and   American people thank you very much   everybody thank you thank you   you   you

way you ran Texas because there's   going to be a great operation and he did   a great job or honored to have all three   and i'm really honored to have our Vice   President because Mike Pence has been   outstanding hasn't he been outstanding   together this group is going to do a   truly great job for our country we have   a very very impressive group here to   celebrate the start of a new era in   American energy and production and job   creation the action I'm taking today   will eliminate federal overreach restore   economic freedom and allow our companies   and our workers to thrive compete and   succeed on a level playing field for the   first time in a long time fell it's been   a long time I'm not just talking about   eight years we're talking about a lot   longer than eight years you people know   it may be better than anybody thanks as   well to the many distinguished members   of Congress who have taken the time to   be here I want to thank all of our   industry leaders who are with us and who   share our determination to create jobs   in America for Americans and Shelley   thank you very much also I spotted you   in the audience thank you that is what   this is all about bringing back our jobs   bringing back our dreams and making   America wealthy again I also want to   thank the dedicated public servants who   are with us this afternoon you're doing   important work to protect our health and   public resources so important finally I   want to acknowledge the truly amazing   people behind me on this stage our   incredible coal miners   I love our coal miners   great people over the past two years   I've spent time with the miners all over   America they told me about the struggles   they've endured I actually in one case i   went to a group of miners in west   virginia you remember Shelley and I said   how about this why don't we get together   we'll go to another place and you'll get   another job you won't mind anymore do   you like that idea they said no we don't   like that idea we love to mind that's   what we want to do I said if that's what   you want to do that's what you're going   to do and I was very impressed they love   the job that's what their job is I fully   understand that I grew up in a real   estate family and until this recent   little excursion into the world of   politics I could never understand why   anybody would not want to be in the   world of real estate believe me so I   understand it and we're with you a   hundred percent and that's what you're   going to do okay   the miners told me about the attacks on   their jobs and their livelihoods they   told me about the efforts to shut down   their minds their communities and their   very way of life I made them this   promise we will put our miners back to   work   we've already eliminated a devastating   anti-coal regulation but that was just   the beginning today I'm taking bold   action to follow through on that promise   my administration is putting an end to   the war on coal going to have clean coal   really clean coal with today's executive   action I am taking historic steps to   lift the restrictions on American energy   to reverse government intrusion and to   cancel job-killing regulations   and by the way regulations not only in   this industry but in every industry   we're doing them by the thousands every   industry and we're gonna have safety   we're going to have clean water we're   going to have clean air but so many are   unnecessary and so many are job-killing   we're getting rid of the bad ones one   after another we're keeping our promises   and putting power back into the hands of   the people first today's energy   independence action calls for an   immediate reevaluation of the so-called   clean power plan perhaps   perhaps no single regulation threatens   our miners energy workers and companies   more than this crushing attack on   American industry second we are lifting   the ban on federal leasing for coal   production third we are lifting   job-killing restrictions on the   production of oil natural gas clean coal   and shale energy and finally we are   returning power to the states where that   power belongs states and local   communities know what is best for them   they understand it they get it they've   been doing it for a long time it was   taken away from them and not handled   well and they are the ones that we   should now and will now in power to   decide my action today is the latest in   a series of steps to create American   jobs and to grow American wealth we're   ending the theft of American prosperity   and rebuilding our beloved country we   approved the permit to finally build the   Keystone XL pipeline and cleared the way   to completion of the Dakota access   pipeline thousands and thousands of jobs   [Applause]   we've already created a half a million   new jobs in the first two jobs reports   of my administration and if you notice   today Ford great company announced   massive new spending on three big plants   in the state of Michigan a state which I   love very much you remember what   happened in Michigan remember november   eighth oh that was an exciting Michigan   evening and for just made that   announcement that's a great announcement   it's a very important announcement means   jobs jobs jobs we're going to continue   to expand energy production and we will   also create more jobs in infrastructure   trucking and manufacturing this will   allow the EPA to focus on its primary   mission of protecting our air and   protecting our water together we are   going to start a new energy revolution   one that celebrates American production   on American soil we want to make our   goods here instead of shipping them in   from other countries all over the world   they ship in ship in take the Americans   money take the money go home take our   jobs take our companies no longer folks   no longer we believe in those really   magnificent words made in the USA   we will unlock job producing natural gas   oil and shale energy we will produce   American coal to power American industry   we will transport American energy   through American pipelines made with   American steel made with American steel   can you believe somebody would actually   say that this came up a little bit   coincidentally when I was signing the   pipeline deals I'm all signing I've got   him done and I said folks what do we get   the steal and they said I think it's   from foreign lands I said no good who   makes it who makes those beautiful pipes   for the pipeline so they're made outside   of this contrast and no more no more so   we added a little claws didn't take much   that you want to build pipelines in this   country you're going to buy your steel   and you're going to have it fabricated   here makes sense right doesn't it make   sense Bob think so he knows   together we will create millions of good   American jobs also so many energy jobs   and really lead to unbelievable   prosperity all throughout our country   and Rick Perry's gonna have a lot to do   with it I want to just thank everybody   in this room you're all very special   people in particular I want to thank the   monitors you know my guys they'll get   enough thanks these people haven't had   enough thanks

promise so I   want to thank everybody in the room god   bless you and God bless america thank   you very much thank   [Music]   [Music]   come on basically you know what this   says you know what it

Ra-_2uqottM~Trump TV Network~20170227~FULL: President Donald Trump Press Conference (2/27/2017) Trump Speaks to Governors~12948.0~4.27461147308~158.0~35.0~   the gentleman Governors members of the   cabinet the President of the United   States   [Applause]   [Applause]   thank you all very much   [Applause]   ok you know   [Applause]   that is pretty good al Qaeda coming from   governor's I can't really I can't even   believe it that's so impressive and I   very much appreciate you being and thank   you to vice president pence he has been   so wonderful to work with he's a real   talent a real guy ennia central casting   do we agree central com who's been bred   good morning everybody and welcome back   to the White House the first lady and I   were very very happy last night to host   you we saw some real talent military   talent musicians who were fantastic and   everybody enjoy I'm very proud to have   so many former governors in my cabinet   vice president pence as you know big   governor from a very great state state i   like very much indiana nikki Haley at   the UN is Dickie here someplace think so   yes we have Rick Perry is going before   we're trying to get people approve we   can't get them out but rick is going to   do a fantastic job sonny perdue will be   joining the cabinet very soon terry   Branstad will be our ambassador to china   and interesting story on Terry every   time I spoke in Iowa he'd say please   don't say anything bad about China I   said what do you mean what do you mean   he said I like China and we do a lot of   business with China and really just   don't and I said hmm so when it came   time to pick in an ambassador I called   him up I said you like China and i can   tell you china is very very happy with   that choice so we met everybody   right these governor's thank you and   thank you terry these governors have   been bold reformers and their success   shows why we need to make states the   laboratories of democracy once again   many of you have shared past   frustrations with waiting for permission   from federal government and agencies and   I understand that and I've had many   people tell me about it and it's been   catastrophic for so many estates you   know your citizens and you want you know   they want things done but they don't get   things done and it's not your fault   sometimes it's your fault but they   understand that but sometimes it's not   your fault we're going to speed it up   because that's not how a partnership is   supposed to work the government should   not stand in your way in delivering   needed reforms and services and it won't   we're going to move very very quickly   environmentally with Scott and so many   others that are involved in the process   of regulation we are going to be cutting   we're going to be doing the right thing   we're going to be protecting people   environmentally and safety wise but   we're going to be moving it quickly very   quickly   and and I can speaking of that I know   many of you and I've spoken to some of   you last night about it have many   projects that aren't tired I mean just   literally tied up because of   environmental concerns and it's been in   for years and years and years the   project your state wants great for   employment everybody wants them and they   couldn't get them out of Environmental   Protection and we will get them out now   that doesn't mean they're going to be   approved but it will be rejected quickly   one way or the other there'll be either   rejected quickly are they going to get   approved I would say most will be   approved but you're going to know you're   not going to wait nine years or 11 years   some of the horror stories that I've   heard under my administration we're   going to have a true partnership of   collaboration and cooperation we will   get to the answers and we will get them   quickly and the flexibility you need to   implement the reforms that you are going   to have in order to make decision making   proper and decision making fast so we're   going to do both those things proper and   fast one of the most important   responsibilities for the federal   government is the budget of the United   States my first budget will be submitted   to the Congress next month this budget   will be a public safety and national   security budget very much based on those   two with plenty of other things but very   strong and it will include a historic   increase in defense spending to rebuild   the depleted military of the United   States of America at a time the most   [Applause]   and you'll be hearing about that   tomorrow night in great detail this is a   landmark event a message to the world in   these dangerous times of American   strength security and resolve we must   ensure that our courageous service men   and women have the tools they need to   deter war and when called upon to fight   in our name only do one thing wind we   have to win we have to start winning   wars again have to say when I was young   in high school and college everybody   used to say we never lost a war we never   lost the war you remember some of you   are right there with me and you remember   we never lost a war America never last   and now we never win a war we never win   and we don't fight to win we don't fight   doing so either gotta win or don't fight   it at all but where we are 17 years   almost 17 years of fighting in the   Middle East we're up I said chart the   other day as of about a month ago six   trillion dollars we've spent in the   Middle East six trillion dollars and I   want to tell you that's just   unacceptable and we're nowhere actually   if you think about it well less than   know where the Middle East is far worse   than it was 16 17 years ago there's not   even a contest so we've spent six   trillion dollars we have a hornet's nest   it's a mess like you've never seen   before we're nowhere so we're going to   straighten it out this defense spending   increase will be offset and paid for by   finding greater savings and efficiencies   across the federal government we're   going to do more with less I got   involved in an airplane contract I got   involved in some other contracts and we   cut the hell out of the prices i mean we   saved a lot of money tremendous amount   of money beyond anything that the   generals that were involved they said   they've never seen anything like before   11   complain on a small order of one plane I   saved 725 million dollars and i would   say i devoted about if I edited up all   of calls probably about an hour so I   think that might be my highest and best   use because if we can do that our budget   will be nothing my and there are many   other places it's all the same and in   one way that's a good thing because we   have an answer and David is going to do   a fantastic job at the VSA david is   sitting there shaking his head stand up   [Applause]   so we can't get our people through   cabinet but he went through was it 95 to   nothing how the hell did you do that boy   oh boy he must be good you were the one   100 20 well chose you hey we can do it   but we do we have still quite a few   cabinet members and they're just in   limbo waiting waiting it's like   obstruction it's obstruction and but   eventually we'll get them and they'll   put their people in and we'll get those   agencies etc to work we're going to do   more with less and make the government   lean and accountable to the people we   can do so much more with the money we   spend with the 20 trillion dollars in   debt can you imagine that the government   must learn to tighten its belt something   families all across the country have had   to learn to do unfortunately but they've   had to learn to do and they've done it   well my budget increases spending and   the increase in all spending for federal   law enforcement also and activities   having to do with law enforcement will   be substantially increased and we will   fight violent crime you look at what's   happening in our cities you look at   what's happening in Chicago what's going   on in Chicago we will fight violent   crime and we will win and we'll win that   one fairly quickly once we give the   local police local law enforcement the   right to go in and fight it and we back   them monetarily and also otherwise and   we're going to win that one we're going   to win it fairly quickly I believe my   budget also puts a mirror   first by keeping tax dollars in America   to help veterans and first responders so   important this budget follows through   and my promise to focus on keeping   Americans safe keeping out terrorists   keeping out criminals and putting   violent offenders behind bars or   removing them from our country   altogether and i must say that we've   been treated very well very very well on   the job the general kelly is done at the   border it's tough it's strong I was   talking last night to Terry McAuliffe   and he said you have to mention this   because he met with where is Terry there   around here someplace Terry and he met   with general kelly and i think i can say   you were impressed with general kelly   and he said you have to get the point   out that they're removing the bad ones   and that's where our focus is it's the   bad ones we're getting some very very   bad players out of this country drug   lords gang members heads of gangs   killers murderers we're getting them out   that's what we're focused on the presses   and covering that unfortunately but it's   something that is very important we're   getting the bad ones that and that's   always where I said I was going to start   I was going to start with these bad   players and they are bad they are rough   and tough and we're getting them a hell   out of our country and we're bringing   them to where they started out let their   country do what they have to do with   them so the budget which is going to be   a very big part of tomorrow night's   speech is going to be I think a budget   of great rationality but it's going to   have to do with military safety economic   development and things such as that   great detail tomorrow night we're also   going to do whatever we can to restore   the authority of the states when that is   the appropriate thing to do we're going   to give you back a lot of the powers   that have been taken away from States   and great people and great governors and   you can control it better than the   federal government because you're right   on top of it you have something that's   controllable so I think that's going to   be very important you see that already   taken   we have to let the state's compete and   to see who has the best solutions they   know the best how to spend their dollars   and how to take care of the people   within each state and states are   different and people are different so   the governor's are going to have a lot   more decision-making ability than they   have right now all states will benefit   from our economic agenda we will reduce   taxes very very substantially and   simplify the tax code we're also going   to make taxes between countries much   more fair we're one of the only   countries in the world that can people   can sell their product into US and have   no tax no nothing and they get rich and   yet if you want to do business with them   you'll have taxes I've seen as high as a   hundred percent so they sell in to us no   problem we sell into them because we   don't sell in because the tax is so high   that they don't want us to sell it to   them so I know that's always been a   point of contention but to me it's just   fair it's just fair its reciprocal it's   fair and so we're going to be doing a   lot of work on that and that's becoming   a very very important factor fairness   because I believe in free trade I want   so much trade you know somebody said oh   maybe he's a total nationalist which I   am in a true sense but I want trade I   want great trade between countries but   the word free is very deceiving because   it's good for them it's not good for us   I want fair trade and if we're going to   be taxed they should be taxed at the   same amount the other countries and one   of two things is going to happen we're   going to make a lot of money or the   other country is going to get rid of its   text and that's good too because now the   product like harley-davidson I was   talking to them the product will now   flow into other countries where right   now they can't do so we're going to make   it easier for states to invest in   infrastructure and I'm going to have a   big statement tomorrow night on   infrastructure we spent six trillion in   the Middle East and we have potholes all   over our highways and our roads I have a   friend who's in the trucking business he   said   my trucks are destroyed going from New   York to Los Angeles they're destroyed he   said I'm not going to get the good   trucks anyway he always prided himself   on buying the best equipment he said the   roads are so bad that by the time we   make the journey from new york to los   angeles or back he said the equipment is   just beat to hell i said when has it   been like that before he said it's never   been in the business for 40 years he   said it's never been like that 40 years   never been like that so we're going to   take care of that infrastructure we're   going to start spending on   infrastructure big and not like we have   a choice it's not like oh gee let's hold   it off our highways our bridges are   unsafe our tunnels I mean we have   tunnels in New York with the tiles or on   the ceiling and you see many tiles   missing and you wonder you know you're   driving 40 miles an hour 50 miles an   hour through a tunnel take a look at the   lincoln tunnel in the Queens Midtown   Tunnel and you're driving and you see   all this loose material that's heavy you   know it was made many years ago so it's   heavy today it's light used to be better   the problem is you got to hold it up and   I say to myself every time I Drive   through I say I wonder how many people   are hurt or injured when they're driving   at 40 50 miles an hour through a tunnel   and a tile falls off and there's so many   missing tiles and such loose conklin so   we have to fix our infrastructure it's   not like we have a choice we have no   choice and we're going to do it and it   also happens to mean jobs which is a   good thing we're going to repeal and   replace Obamacare and get States the   flexibility that they need to make the   end result really weird for them very   complicated issue we have Tom Price just   got confirmed sitting here   [Applause]   and I spent a lot of time with Governor   Walker and Governor Rick Scott the other   day we're talking about it they're   really very expert on the subject and I   want to thank them they spent a lot of   time with me Governor Christie who's   here someplace where's Chris Governor   Christie thank you and so we have a lot   of we have a lot of talent at a lot of   expertise here I will tell you and we   have come up with a solution that's   really really I think very good now I   have to tell you it's an unbelievably   complex subject nobody knew that health   care could be so complicated and   statutorily and for budget purposes as   you know we have to do health care   before we do the tax cut the tax cut is   going to be major it's going to be   simple and the whole tax plan is   wonderful but I can't do it until we do   health care because we have to know what   the health care is going to cost and   statutorily that's the way it is so for   those people that say oh gee I wish we   could do you know the tax versus it just   doesn't work that way I would like to do   that for us it's actually tax-cutting   has never been that easy but it's a tiny   little ant compared to what we're   talking about with Obamacare and you   have to remember it I say this to   Democrats in the room of which we have   many Obamacare has failed if you go to   Minnesota where they had a sixty-six   percent increase and the governor of   Minnesota who's with us today said   Obamacare the Affordable Care Act is no   longer affordable something to that   effect I think that might be at exactly   but the Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable Obamacare has failed I say to   the Republicans if you really want to do   politically something good don't do   anything sit back for a period of two   years because 17 is going to be a   disaster a disaster for Obamacare if we   don't do something let it be a disaster   because we can blame that on the dems   that are in our room and we can blame   that on the Democrats and President   Obama let it implode and then let it   upload an 18 even worse don't do   anything and they will come   begging for us to do something but   that's not the fair thing to do for the   people not the fair thing politically I   think it would be a great solution   because as soon as we touch it if we do   the most money new thing just a tiny   little change what's going to happen   they're going to say it's the   Republicans problem that's the way it is   but we have to do what's right because   Obamacare is a failed disaster and it's   interesting it's sort of like when you   see it you see it with politicians you   see with President Obama when you know   he's getting out of office and the clock   is ticking and he's not going to be   there his approval rating goes way up   even though you know not that active in   the last period of time the approval   rating goes up that's not him that's   like almost everybody I see it happening   with Obamacare people hate it but now   they see that the end is coming and they   said oh maybe we love it there's nothing   to love it's a disaster folks okay so   you have to remember that and very   importantly we are going to work to   restore local control to our nation's   education system Betsy's here someplace   and she is going to be I think fantastic   I think she's going to be   [Applause]   Betsy feel so strongly and she's had   such support from so many people you   know you don't see that too much because   you see the anti you never see the   positive but i can tell you I've had so   many calls while she was going through   that horrible process I was a tough   tough nasty process and she hung and she   was strong as you get but so many people   were calling Betsy saying you will do   such a fantastic job once you get it   it's like sometimes I'd say it's much   tougher to get into Harvard than it is   to stay there does that make sense it's   tougher to get into the Wharton School   of Finance you can't get in but if you   get in it's fine you get through right I   think you're going to do a fantastic job   and we're very proud of you and you took   a lot of heat but you're going to do   great so she wants to bring   decision-making powers back to parents   back to the families and back to the   states where they can really control   education and just finally I'm looking   forward to working with you in these   projects and so much more we're going to   do these projects and so many more and I   thank you all again for being here it's   going to be a wood so much more we're   going to do these projects and so many   more and I thank you all again for being   here it's going to be a really   productive discussion so productive that   I'm going to ask the press to start   leaving because I wouldn't want them to   see any great productive session but   that was again thank you very much will   do this   takes inflection   [Applause]

in my   inaugural address to the American people   I pledged to strengthen America's oldest   friendships and to build new   partnerships in pursuit of peace I also   promise that America will not seek to   impose our way of life on others but to   outstretch our hands in the spirit of   cooperation and Trust   our vision is one of peace security and   prosperity in this region and all   throughout the world our goal is a   coalition of nations who share the aim   of stamping out extremism and providing   our children a hopeful future that does   honor to God and so this historic and

  and made record investments in our   military that will protect the safety of   our people and enhance the security of   our wonderful friends and allies many of   whom are here today now there is even   more blessedness that I am pleased to   share with you my meetings with King   Salman the crown prince and the deputy   Crown Prince have been filled with great   warmth goodwill and tremendous

people how to live what to do who to be   or how to worship instead we are here to   offer partnership based on shared   interests and values to pursue a better   future for all of us here at this summit   we will discuss many interests that we   share together but above all we must be   united in pursuing the one goal that   transcends every other consideration   that goal is to meet history's great   test to conquer extremism and thank the   forces that terrorism brings with it   every single time   young Muslim boys and girls should be   able to grow up free from fear safe from   violence and innocent of hatred when   young Muslim men and women should have   the chance to build a new era of   prosperity for themselves it has to be   done and we have to let them do it   with God's help this summit will mark   the beginning of the end for those who   practice terror and spread its vile   Creed at the same time we pray this   special gathering may someday be   remembered as the beginning of peace in   the Middle East and maybe even all over   the world but this future can only be   achieved through defeating terrorism and   the ideology that drives it few nations   have been spared the violent reach of   terrorism America has suffered repeated   barbaric attacks from the atrocities of   September 11th to the devastation of the   Boston bombings to the horrible killings   in San Bernardino and Orlando the   nations of Europe have also endured   unspeakable horror so too have the   nations of Africa and South America   India Russia China and Australia have   all been victims but in sheer numbers   the deadliest toll has been exacted on   the innocent people of Arab Muslim and   Middle Eastern nations they have borne   the brunt of the killings and the worst   of the destruction in this wave of   fanatical violence   some estimates hold that more than 95%   of the victims of terrorism are   themselves Muslim we now face   humanitarian and security disaster in   this region that is spreading across the   planet it is a tragedy of epic   proportions no description of the   suffering and depravity can begin to   capture its full measure the to crow of   Isis   if you look at what's happening al Qaeda   Hezbollah Hamas and so many others must   be counted not only in the number of   dead it also must be counted in   generations of vanished dreams the   Middle East is rich with natural beauty   vibrant cultures and massive amounts of   historic treasures   it should increasingly become one of the   great global centres of Commerce and   opportunity this region should not be a   place from which refugees flee but to   which newcomers flock Saudi Arabia is   home to the holiest sites in one of the   world's great faiths each year millions   of Muslims come from around the world to   Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj in   addition to ancient wonders this country   is also home to modern ones including   soaring achievements in architecture   Egypt was a thriving center of learning   and achievement thousands of years   before other parts of the world the   wonders of his luxor and alexandria are   proud monuments to that ancient heritage   all over the world people dream of   walking through the ruins of Petra in   Jordan Iraq was the cradle of   civilization and is a land of natural   beauty and the United Arab Emirates has   reached incredible Heights with glass   and steel and turned earth and water   into spectacular works of art the entire   region is at the center of the key   shipping lines of the Suez Canal the red   sea and the Straits of Hormuz the   potential of this region has never ever   in greater 65% of its population is   under the age of 30 like all young men   and women they seek great futures to   build great national projects to join   and a place for their families to call   home but this untapped potential is   tremendous cause of optimism is held at   bay by bloodshed and terror there can be   no coexistence with this violence there   can be no tolerating it no accepting it   no excusing it and no ignoring it every   time a terrorist murders an innocent   person and falsely invokes the name of   God it should be an insult to every   person of faith terrorists do not   worship God they worship death if we do   not act against this organized terror   then we know what will happen and what   will be the end result   terrorism's devastation of life will   continue to spread peaceful societies   will become engulfed by violence and the   futures of many generations will be   sadly squandered if we do not stand in   uniform condemnation of this killing   then not only will we be judged by our   people not only will we be judged by   history but we will be judged by God   this is not a battle between different   faiths different sects or different   civilizations this is a battle between   barbaric criminals who seek to   obliterate human life and decent people   all in the name of religion people that   want to protect life and want to protect   their religion   this is a battle between good and evil   when we see the scenes of destruction in   the wake of terror we see no signs that   those murdered were Jewish or Christian   Shia or Sunni when we look upon the   strains of innocent blood soaked into   the ancient ground we cannot see the   faith or sect or tribe of the victims we   see only that they were children of God   whose this are an insult to all that is   holy but we can only overcome this evil   if the forces of good are united and   strong and if everyone in this room does   their fair share and fulfills their part   of the burden terrorism has spread all   across the world but the path to peace   begins right here on this ancient soil   in this sacred land America is prepared   to stand with you in pursuit of shared   interests and common security but the   nations of the Middle East cannot wait   for American power to crush this enemy   for them the nations of the Middle East   will have to decide what kind of future   they want for themselves for their   country and frankly for their families   and for their children it's a choice   between two futures and that is a choice   America cannot make for you a better   future is only possible if your nations   drive out the terrorists and drive out   the extremists   drive them out drive them out of your   places of worship drive them out of your   communities drive them out of your holy   land and drive them out of this earth   for our part America is committed to   adjusting our strategies to   meet evolving threats and new facts we   will discard those strategies that have   not worked and will apply new approaches   informed by experienced talent and   judgment we are adopting a principle   realism rooted in common values shared   interests and common sense our friends   will never question our support and our   enemies will never doubt our   determination our partnerships will   advance security through stability not   through radical disruption we will make   decisions based on real-world outcomes   not inflexible ideology we will be   guided by the lessons of experience not   the confines of rigid thinking and   wherever possible we will seek gradual   reforms not sudden intervention we must   seek partners not perfection and to make   allies of all who share our goals above   all America seeks peace not war Muslim   nations must be willing to take on the   burden if we are going to defeat   terrorism and send its wicked ideology   into oblivion   the first task in this joint effort is   for your nations to deny all territory   to the foot soldiers of evil every   country in the region has an absolute   duty to ensure that terrorists find no   sanctuary on their soil many are already   making significant contributions to   regional security Jordanian pilots are   crucial partners against Isis in Syria   and Iraq Saudi Arabia and a regional   coalition have taken strong action   against Guti militants in Yemen the   Lebanese army is hunting Isis operatives   who try to in filter   eight their territory amaretti troops   are supporting our Afghan partners and   supporting them strongly in Mosul   American troops are supporting Kurds   Sunnis and she is fighting together for   their homeland Qatar which hosts the US   Central Command is a crucial strategic   partner our long-standing partnership   with Kuwait and Bahrain continue to   enhance security in the region   our courageous Afghan soldiers are   making tremendous sacrifices in the   fight against the Taliban and others in   the fight for their country as we deny   terrorist organization control of   territory and populations we must also   strip them of their access to funds we   must cut off the financial channels that   let Isis sell oil let extremists pay   their fighters and help terrorists   smuggle their reinforcements I am proud   to announce that the nations here today   will be signing an agreement to prevent   the financing of terrorism called the   terrorist financing targeting center   co-chaired by the United States and   Saudi Arabia and joined by every member   of the Gulf Cooperation Council it is   another historic step in a day that will   be long remembered I also applaud the   Gulf Cooperation Council for blocking   funders from using their countries as a   financial base for terror and for   designating Hezbollah as a terrorist   organization which they certainly are   last year   Saudi Arabia also joined us this week in   placing sanctions   when one of the most senior leaders of   Hezbollah of course there is still much   work to be done   that means honestly confronting the   crisis of Islamic extremism and the   Islamists and Islamic terror of all   kinds we must stop what they're doing to   inspire because they do nothing to   inspire but kill and we are having a   very profound effect if you look at   what's happened recently and it means   standing together against the murder of   innocent Muslims the oppression of women   the persecution of Jews and the   slaughter of Christians religious   leaders must make this absolutely clear   barbarism will deliver you no glory   piety to evil will bring you no dignity   if you choose the path of terror your   life will be empty your life will be   brief and your soul will be fully   condemned and political leaders must   speak out to affirm the same idea heroes   don't kill innocence they save them many   nations here today have taken important   steps to raise up that message Saudi   Arabia's vision for 2030 is an important   and encouraging statement of tolerance   respect empowering women and economic   development the United Arab Emirates has   also engaged in the battle for the   hearts and souls and with the United   States launched a center to counter the   online spread of hate Bahrain too is   working to undermine recruitment and   radicalism I also applaud your Turkey   and Lebanon for their role in hosting   refugees the surge of migrants and   refugees   living and just living so poorly that   they're forced to leave the Middle East   depletes the human capital needed to   build stable societies and economies   instead of depriving this region of so   much human potential Middle Eastern   countries can give young people hope for   a brighter future in their home nations   and regions that means promoting the   aspirations and dreams of all citizens   who seek a better life including women   children and the followers of all faced   numerous Arab and Islamic scholars have   eloquently argued that protecting   equality strengthens Arab and Muslim   communities for many centuries the   Middle East has been home to Christians   Muslims and Jews living side-by-side we   must practice tolerance and respect for   each other once again and make this   region of place where every man and   woman no matter their faiths or   ethnicity can enjoy a life of dignity   and hope in that spirit after concluding   my risen in a fabulous place that we're   at today Riyadh which I've gotten to   know so well in so short a time I will   travel to Jerusalem and Bethlehem and   then to the Vatican visiting many of the   holiest places in the three Abrahamic   faiths   if these 3-phase can join together in   cooperation then peace in this world is   possible   including peace between Israelis and   Palestinians I will be meeting with both   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin   Netanyahu and Palestinian President   Abbas   starving terrorists of their territory   of their funding and the false allure of   the Craven ideology will be the basis   for easily defeating them but no   discussion of stamping out this threat   would be complete without mentioning the   government that gives terrorists all   three safe harbor financial backing and   the social standing needed for   recruitment it is a regime that is   responsible for so much instability in   that region I am speaking of course of   Iran from Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen al   and funds arms and trains terrorists   militias and other extremist groups that   spread destruction and chaos across the   region for decades Iran has fueled the   fires of sectarian conflict and terror   is a government that speaks openly of   mass murder vowing the destruction of   Israel death to America and ruin for   many leaders and nations in this very   room among Iran's most tragic and   destabilizing interventions you've seen   it in Syria bolstered by Iran Assad has   committed unspeakable crimes and the   United States has taken firm action in   response to the use of banned chemical   weapons by the Assad regime   launching 59 missiles at the Syrian Air   Base from where that murders attack   originated responsible nations must work   together to end the humanitarian crisis   in Syria eradicate Isis and restore   stability to the region and as quickly   as possible   the Iranian regime's longest suffering   victims are its own people Iran has a   rich history and culture but the people   of Iran have endured hardship and   despair under their leaders reckless   pursuit of conflict and terror until the   Iranian regime is willing to be a   partner for peace all nations of   conscience must work together to isolate   deny it   funding for terrorism cannot do it and   pray for the day when the Iranian people   have the just and righteous government   they so richly deserve the decisions we   make will affect countless lives King   Salman I thank you for the creation of   this great moment in history and for   your massive investments in America and   its industries and its jobs I also thank   you for investing in the future of this   part of the world the Fertile region and   it is so fertile has all of the   ingredients for extraordinary success a   rich history and culture a young and   vibrant people a thriving spirit of   enterprise but you can only unlock this   future if the citizens of the Middle   East are freed from extremism terror and   violence we in this room are the leaders   of our peoples they look to us for   answers and for action and when we look   back at their faces behind every pair of   eyes is a soul that yearns for justice   and yearns for peace today billions of   faces are now looking at us waiting for   us to act on the great question   of our time will we be indifferent in   the presence of evil will we protect our   citizens from its violent ideology will   we let its venom spread through our   societies will we let it destroy the   most holy sites on earth if we do not   confront this deadly terror we know what   the future will bring more suffering   more death and more despair but if we   act if we leave this magnificent room   unified and determined to do what it   takes to destroy the terror that   threatens the world then there is no   limit to the great future our citizens   will have the birthplace of civilization   is waiting to begin a new renaissance   just imagine what tomorrow could bring   glorious wonders of science art medicine   commerce to inspire mankind great cities   built on the ruins of shattered towns   new jobs and industries that will lift   up millions and millions of people   parents who no longer worry for their   children their families and who no   longer mourn for their loved ones and   the faithful who finally worship without   fear these are the blessings of   prosperity and peace these are the   desires that burn with a righteous flame   in every single human heart and these   are the just demands of our beloved   people I ask you to join me   to join together to work together and to   fight together because united we will   not fail we cannot fail nobody   absolutely nobody can beat us thank you   god bless you god bless your countries   and god bless the United States of   America thank you very much thank you
rhtKSOW_1Iw~Trump TV Network~20170313~WATCH: President Donald Trump Leads a Listening Session on Healthcare~14665.0~4.60479021072~301.0~33.0~   thank you all for being here today it's   a great honor for you to share the   personal stories of struggle under the   enormous strain imposed on you by the   very very failed and failing Obamacare   law secretary price and I along with my   entire administration and a lot of   people in the Senate and a lot of people   in the house are committed to repealing   and replacing this disaster is long with   a health care plan that lowers costs   expands choice and ensures access for   everyone you represent the millions of   Americans who have seen their Obama care   premiums increase by double-digit and   even triple digits in Arizona the rates   are over a hundred and sixteen percent   last year 116 percent increase and the   deductibles is so high they don't even   get to use it many Americans lost their   plans and doctors all together in one   third of the counties think of it   one-third only have one insurer left of   many insurance companies to flee they   got so many gun the House bill to repeal   and replace Obamacare will provide you   and your fellow citizens with more   choices pharmacist at lower cost   americans should pick the plan they want   now they'll be able to pick the plan   they want they'll be able to pick the   doctor they want they'll be able to do a   lot of things that the other play was   supposed to give it a never gave you   don't pick your doctor you know if you   plan you remember that one we're not   going to have one size fits all instead   we're going to be working to unleash the   power of the private marketplace   insurer's come in and compete for your   business and you'll see rates go down   down down and you'll see plans go up up   up you have a lot of choices your plans   that nobody's even thinking of today   they will have plans that today nobody   has even thought about because the   market is going to enforce them with   millions and millions of people wanting   health care more competition and less   regulation will finally bring down the   cost of care and I think it will bring   it down very significantly unfortunately   it takes a while to get there because   you have to let that marketplace kick in   and it's going to take a little while to   get there once it does it's going to be   a thing of beauty I wish it didn't take   a year in two years but that's what's   going to happen and that's the way it   works but we're willing to go through   that process working together we'll get   the job done and I have to stay this   just in closing and that I want to hear   some of your stories and we'll let the   press stay for your stories if you like   but the press is making Obamacare look   so good all of a sudden I'm watching the   news look so good they're showing these   reports about this one gets so much and   this one gets so much first what covers   very few people and it's imploding and   17 will be the worst view and I said it   once I'll say it again because Obama's   gun you know he that things are going to   be very bad this year for the people   with Obamacare they're gonna have   tremendous increases and the Republicans   frankly are putting themselves in a very   bad position I tell this to Tom Price   all the time by repealing obama because   people aren't going to see the truly   devastating effects of obamacare they're   not going to see the devastation in 17   and 18 and 19 it'll be gone by that   it'll whether we do it or not it'll be   imploded off the map so the press is   making it look so wonderful so that if   we ended everyone's going to say all   remember how great obamacare used to be   remember how wonderful it used to me it   was so great   it's a little bit like President Obama   what he left people like them when he   was here people didn't like him so much   that's the way life goes that's human   nature the fact is Obamacare is a   disaster and by and I say this the   Republicans all the time by repealing it   by getting rid of it by ending it   everyone's going to say oh just would be   so great but it wasn't great and I tell   Tom Price and I tell Paul Ryan I tell   every one of them I say the best thing   you can do politically is wait a year   because it's going to blow itself off   the map but that's the wrong thing to do   for the country it's the wrong thing to   do for us is so with that I'd like to   introduce some of the folks and you   could say a few words about your   experience with Obamacare and perhaps   the press will even report it would you   like to start yeah thank you for this   opportunity mr. president thank you our   rates are three times they were before   Obamacare started we have one provider   in our county we have very little   options for what we can and cannot do   we're a small business owner we're   actually not a brick-and-mortar we are   Cal ranchers we can't afford our   equipment if we're paying these rates   year after year after year our food   source is in jeopardy because of this   health care law   it's my basic I know sorry oh hey this   is what's happening it's gone up three   times and then you have to pay if you   don't want to use it you have to pay   that's the old-time beauty you don't   want to use it you have to pay and Tom   have to pay big league right so people   say well i use it i use it i'm paying   too much if i don't use it have to pay a   penalty and do you ever pay penalties do   you ever do that or you have to we   haven't as of yet but we were uninsured   in december they dropped us for the   fourth time after we paid over fifty   thousand dollars last year for health   care and it's gone up triple yes and   before obamacare you actually a good   health care we did we've had a fantastic   lot of people nobody ever takes that   into account i'm not saying the system   before was good because I it wasn't but   millions of people had great health care   that they love now when you start   deducting those millions of people from   the simple people that are happy you   have a very small number of people that   are happy that I can tell you how about   you well we're kind of the same story is   Carrie in 2009 I'm a full-time job just   ate my mom two kids for our family it   was never an option to get government   assistance we just don't believe our   neighbors should work harder so that we   don't have to so my husband said if you   can pay for internships at the time with   six hundred fifty dollars a month for   private health insurance for a family of   four than that respond from 2009 2 2015   that private insurance would have x 102   percent   finally his employer told us in 2015   when it one of the final time an   additional thirty four percent that they   could carry our family anymore so I had   to enter back into the workforce but I   couldn't find a job that offered health   insurance so we entered the under   Obamacare and we believe the sales pitch   that if you like your doctor you can   keep your doctor so even though we're   going to have to pay three hundred   dollars a month for Obamacare we thought   we'd still be okay with our doctors   we're on it for five months our   pediatrician for children wouldn't take   it my doctor wouldn't take it so he paid   them eight thousand dollars in five   months and we're never never able to use   it and I think what makes our family   story unique is we're by no means   wealthy in 2014 when we entered the   exchange we made fifty three thousand   dollars as a family my husband and I   together was our gross income and then   in 2015 we made together since i go back   to work 74000 that when you look at   paying ten thousand and health friends   and insurance and health call then   really what you sent hot and how do you   found a volunteer it he's so happy to   see it down I'm   it's almost that our family and   financial ruin and that's the story for   a lot of people put businesses and   finesse trying that's one of the biggest   costs it has been disastrous trade   businesses go ahead shit yes first of   all of its brethren thank you for having   seen I think it's a great opportunity to   tell the American people people Michael   cells that have struggled with I my cell   phone from Miami haven't had very much   trying to prepare the you know president   I States calls on here so i just it just   so happen i had every single year for   the past couple years I've had a   different insurance every single year   before i had an individual plan and a   wife and I my wife is an attorney I'm a   computer programmer I'm a small business   my wife is a small business and I I just   don't understand what happened you know   we we have have a daughter with the   disability changed our plan every year   she named George was good before Obama   oh absolutely I was never I never did   follow like that many many plans were   great before about it they were so happy   and that doesn't justify assisted living   or Obama but people are miserable now   putting people out of business   for a start it's it's just that we had   to chip they canceled our plans and I   could understand why they canceled our   plans so we have no it shows I remember   the president united states say that   individual plans will not be covered   need to have an employer-based plan with   you I do not work for the government I   do not work for a large employer very   unfair um weird that we are ground zero   my case is ground zero for the he   represent a lot of people in the same   since you had absolute very unfair   frontier she's in the same situation and   I think it's very very unfair and I   think that was the real scenario was   that this law was supposed to enclose   like you were saying and my parents are   from you know came from communist Cuba   they know what socialism is all about so   I know what socialism is and that's   pretty much what what's this you know   this whole system were meant to have one   single provider what kinds are   especially with almost a patient when   you think of the right patient lunch   well you can play I'm from Arizona and I   tell you that one hundred sixty percent   increase is real it's not a myth I lost   my plan three times during the the   Obamacare era um after losing it this   year   decide opt out so right now I do not   have to do some health care and I was   went for my 365 dollar a month premium   last year to a 809 Dalek premium this   year at a higher deduct the deductible   was going to be sixty eight hundred   dollars no co-pays so if I went to the   doctor I would be paying out of my   pocket and I just didn't seem like a   good use of my money I felt like I would   be a better steward of that seventeen   thousand dollars at the end of the year   should I police my deductible and just   decided to opt out I went into a   faith-based share crook and I'm doing   that one of the reasons I felt like I   can do this you know so we are taking a   leap of faith right um it's because I   think I know you're going to get this   taken care of so I thought is only going   to be for a year I'll be on my this   program i will opt out of traditional   health care for health insurance and I   think you've got to get it done you have   a lot of people in Arizona saying a big   penalty ah yes mega pelham well I my   husband also released his own   that doesn't count afford to offer   insurance to employees and his employees   who argue also in the independent market   it's just kiddin too much and I had   individual insurance for 25 years since   i started my business so I've always   been in that individual market it always   done was right you know take you know I   took responsibility for myself and sure   I was covered for health care because   I'm a business person I don't want any   you know huge health care expenses to   affect you know money you know that   could be going to my business now happy   to go to a health expense so I you know   I was a you know in my mid 20s when I   sent me on one I betta get we've always   got to get square with this I have to   have any insurance so I have well thank   you very much the people in Arizona to   hit very very hard at least a hundred   sixteen percent here's the bad news it's   going to go off more this year now where   we feel it nobody's going to know that   and the press is going to say how   wonderful it was and G we miss Obamacare   that's the problem its biggest problem I   have thomas's willing to do them a big   favor but it's not the right way go   ahead mr. president thick knocking thank   you thank you very much those names Lois   browner I work for the price Medicus   foundation attorney by training in 2009   when the Affordable Care Act was going   through Congress what became the   Affordable Care Act I was working for   the Democratic   at the time I resign my position because   I I could tell that the democratic bill   that was going through Congress wanted   to publicly funded forschung and that's   not something that I could go along so I   resign my position later work for   congressman dan Lungren in Congress and   went on to eventually work for the   Christ Medicus foundation we were   focused on building a culture of life   perfecting religious liberty and   healthcare protecting the right of   conscience prohibiting the public   funding of abortion and also prohibiting   non discrimination against pro-life   medical providers um I especially as an   african-american a graduate of howell   university school of law that's good   yeah Thank You mr. president and I know   from st. John Paul to he said that the   all of our human and civil rights that   we believe in as Americans that we   shares Americans the right to healthcare   the right to medical care to housing to   all these different things faro losery   if the right to life isn't defended with   maximum determination 17 million   african-americans it's shown that   probably had been aborted since roe v   wade and i supported you in the   presidential election thank you gave   several speeches and michigan telling   folks to vote for a life in the general   election and really happy that you're   here to continue the bipartisan belief   that there should be no taxpayer funding   of abortion and also really to support   your effort to show that the patient the   human person should be at the center of   our American healthcare system not the   government the government has its place   but the patient's be the center so happy   support you much thank you that's so   nice thank you I appreciate it great Joe   yes go ahead mr. president thank you so   much for inviting me my name is dr.   Manny and I run a nonprofit called   healthy Tennessee and across Tennessee   I'm a trauma surgeon but what we do is   in turn is you   we look more to us yes sir I'll see you   there yes sir we do these large   community events we're in rural   Appalachia across Tennessee where we   host these health fairs taking care of   patients so it's really a grassroots   effort something that you understand   better than anybody where people come   out just to help you doctors nurses on   the ground helping folks with preventive   medicine educating folks that's what we   do but the one thing I've been seeing   across Tennessee is that folks really   can't afford these rising premiums so   what they're doing is effectively   they're paying the tax penalty and   they're not because it's cheaper and it   works out better than paying for the for   the insurance and so that's been a big   problem that we're seeing across the   state so thank you so much for what   you're doing to tackle this problem so   you've seen a big problem and the way   out of the problem is to do a plan much   more like the plan we're going to get   done yes sir yes sir we got penalties to   other people don't mention all   now if the other thing about well we're   talking about we really have a   three-phase plan they only want to talk   about the first name the first phase is   just the most basic of phases and then   you have phase two which is largely done   by our Secretary and then your faith   three which is a lot of the bells and   whistles but they don't want to talk   about the bells and whistles so they're   really comparing things to something   that won't be there for long and the   reason we have to do it that way is   because of Congress I'd love to do it   all in one package but if you did it   that way it can't get done so we're   going to get something done that's going   to be terrific I appreciate it thank you   dr. Parrish yesterday I thank you mr.   president I think without kids be here   today I to Tennessee in the farming   industry the fact that i've had three   ball carriers my life and my daughter's   insurance fly through her work i buy my   own and I've seen the increases since   Obama care to the teen of about five   thousand dollars a year just for me and   I considered taking the option of   of the penalty too because my problem   penalty is though if I opt out of the   program and by private plans just a   catastrophic plan with a nominal very   healthy man if I take that option not   only is my income penalized but my   wife's income as well the next   considerable more money money money but   she has issues so I don't think that's   fair and I i don't think the head of the   rate increase is just astronomical I'm   in the county that has one option Blue   Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee and I've   got about a five hundred and forty   dollar and one premium for the seven   thousand dollar item back the duck for   watching you up at all naive you gotta   play up high premium for a plan that I   don't need or don't want when you be   able to continue in the years to come if   you have to keep going like this they're   dropping out every day the book supplier   to their cameras 35 counties in   Tennessee has no watching and all right   now I don't know what those folks do you   know that means I mean somebody's going   to make a lot of money you know i'm   going to go higher money nobody's go off   you you're not going to make the heck   yes   good we're here people are very happy   about your situation thank you for the   opportunity well I appreciate it thank   each other doctor yes sir well I'm a   physician in Texas and thank you for   allowing me to be here today and I'll   tell you what I've seen is that a lot of   patients really are not adequately   covered by Obamacare it was supposed to   cover people but like everyone is said   here with the rising premiums and the   rising deductibles I take care patients   in the hospital and patients are shocked   to get a twenty thousand dollar bill and   define that they're responsible for   6000 of that because their deductible   is so high and that's just the situation   that that cannot continue Medicaid   expansion under Obamacare really doesn't   cover folks either because meaning   physicians are not even taking Medicare   they're not accepting it any longer in   the outpatient setting and so folks who   have chronic medical illnesses like butt   cancer my wife is a breast cancer   survivor and most of her treatment was   actually as an outpatient it was very   expensive outpatient care most positions   don't even accept medicaid so those   patients are stealing our prior so the   Medicaid expansion really hasn't covered   them the folks who have Obamacare   insurance really are inadequately   covered as well because they're still   have pay extremely high premiums and   then having to pay extremely high   deductibles and so it's really do they   I'm reaching with the high deductibles I   don't even reach it you know oftentimes   they do not unless they have some sort   of serious medical problem you're in the   hospital it's very expensively they   don't even reach there done that   often times and so it's unfortunate so I   I really appreciate it I actually   actually read the bill that that's been   produced that's that's coming out of the   house now and I really like a lot of the   changes in it I think that it's going to   correct a lot of a lot of the issues   that Obamacare has had so I really   appreciate what you owe and I oceania   thank you very much similarly wife yes   sorry nice like you thank you GN dan   from assassin I'm a nurse I'm a mom and   part of that huge group of middle-class   families that were affected by the ACA   before ACA we have had insurance that   was eventually cancelled and i had   written a letter to our senator just   asking him what do i do do i quit my job   completely so that we can obtain a   subsidy a job that I love as a nurse and   a hospital but I love or do I hurt my   family and try to find a job with   benefits that doesn't even cover the   metal caps or the health care field ama   care for she's actually in a sense   forces you economically and almost   potentially to get another job right   even though you like you Joe right so I   I did end up getting a hire a full-time   position at the hospital that i worked   at but that came with a price because i   was working three days a week and   spending time with my small children who   are my number one priority what and   after the ACA   I was forced because we could not afford   a premium of twelve hundred dollars per   month and deductible that didn't cover   anything to man the deductible is so   high that essentially unless you had a   really big problem you wouldn't even be   able to use a craft yes and we're still   in that boat I mean right now our   deductible as 6500 dollars and so if I   have a child who's extremely sick it's   going to cost me hundreds of dollars   just last week my daughter had a fever   and I sent her to school for three days   straight because I had to work to afford   our insurance and I couldn't afford to   bring her to the doctor so it has been   devastating for him it's really not   having insurance at all and a lot of   Obamacare you don't really have   insurance because the deductibles are so   high that you really don't have   insurance you think of it all right   thank you very much good luck thank you   well thank you very much for hosting   thank you great I have to start with   something as I was leaving the house my   11 year old   alchemy and said dad I'd like to get   have you give this to mr. president I   wish I yell jump with damage on the bag   good dear president trunk it is a great   honor to be able to write to the   president of the USA I think you're a   great president and a great man also   don't worry the picture of you on the   front of this looks nothing like you   I wish I looked that good thank you all   we had far thank you boy so I had the   privilege of meeting with secretary   price vice president Benson Cincinnati   about a week and a half ago at a round   table and I'll share with you what I   shared with them i started with quote   from the great president ronald reagan   who said the most terrifying words in   the English language are we're from the   government and we're here to help kind   of my feeling on health care frankly I   think that the system was broken before   the last administration got their hands   on and I started my company 21 years ago   and I had a vision of wanting to provide   one hundred percent full family health   care for as long as I had a company   because I really felt in my heart that   it was the right thing to do I was one   of the last holdouts but sadly after   about 15 years I really had a choice of   either having a company or being able to   provide my employees that level of   health care and that's sad you know I   tell my wife all the time you can have   anything you want and we just can't have   everything we want we have the best   health care system in the world we do   but it needs to be fixed what the small   business owners like myself I'm a   manufacturer on several boards in the   Midwest in manufacturing what we'd like   to see is not a government operated   market but a free market you know I saw   Catherine and equipment for a living we   have a trade show every year and there's   hundreds and hundreds of people selling   competitive products if we had a health   care show in my town there'd be three or   four people under that roof and as a   businessman yourself you know what that   does to driving down costs or the lack   thereof so we would like to see more of   a free market solution going back to   what made this country great you know   launch for nore ilysm instead of   empowerment's work ethics instead of   welfare and that's what we'd like to ask   you for and I like the same way as you   know that's what we're doing largely a   wheel   to take care of people we can't afford   to be in absolution like you are so   we're going to do that largely you know   I think beyond everything if you look at   what's going to happen the competitive   bidding a new every element of what   we're doing is competitive bidding but   we have to take care of people who need   the help I told there are a lot of   people like that has always been a   safety net in the United studies and it   should on fortunately when I see 50000   or 50 million Americans taking you no   assistance in their marketing right food   stamps right that's like you know for   the people who really can't provide for   themselves you know we're all charitable   people who are American for the most   generous nation on the face of the earth   so I totally believe in safety nets for   those who need them not free handouts   that would help a lot of people but we   are going to be very much free market   people that can afford it will go out   and they'll be off the cost go ahead   snake voxel County it would need to   become probably only of other elected   officials no precise you guys it's been   an interesting ride just watch the   health care system in the last 26 years   when my son was born he was three and a   half months premature 26 years ago and   we had really good insurance we   basically didn't have to pay anything   out of pocket besides what we were doing   you know from where i worked as time   went on you know you can turn to tell   the healthcare settings been a little   bit broke a little bit broke and then   all suddenly the ACA and i'm not going   to call it the other word i call it the   last president's health care program I   don't want you to say say that name so   anyway it was that you like   yeah it's got to the point where i am a   couple businesses to and do the things   that I have to do I actually ran for   government so I could have insurance and   one but now I'm now I'm looking at these   people saying how can I provide   insurance for them without raising taxes   and doing these things that are   happening right because everything's   more Utah didn't expand Medicaid we   weren't a part of it a part of that and   we can see why now because of the things   that have happened throughout the nation   with states and companies they're happy   selves annoying banker so it got to the   point where I ended up not only with my   businesses had to drive school bus to   keep my wife at home with my kid that   was the was ill so now I own three   businesses I Drive school bus and I'm an   elected official to be able to continue   to do the things i need to do with   health care the last three well the last   three years so it's gone through the   roof oh I've got a six thousand dollar   deductible HSA but i will meet that   again in three months so i'm up 40s i   think my wife's coming in 48 or 49   hundred bucks already this year in march   to be able to meet my out-of-pocket I'm   them and so by the time April comes I   would have met that to be able to get   continue to do that there was one thing   I probably could ask you about and my my   boys got a rare disease and I appreciate   you talking about the rare community in   your speeches is that if somebody has   cancer or somebody has a rare disease or   continues to have problems why do we   have to do a deductible every year I   mean so I'm senator Christmas going   okay my deductibles been back for six or   eight months and I'm going to turn   around and have to do it again for the   same disease for the same surgery yes   for the same everything but it's all   about the risk and spreading the wrist   right with it with insurance over a   period of time so it's a challenge for   individuals with the chronic disease   there's nine I appreciate you thinking   about it and talking about grassroots we   are talking about all the people we   support with the farmers and ranchers   and the small business people and the   people that are in manufacturing park   county is one of the large manufacturing   counties in the nation per capita and   new core would love to tell you thanks   Nucor steel what I tell you thanks for   everything you've been doing new court   has been very good it's going to get   better time we've got a ton of those the   space program we used to make the   shuttle right rocket boosters out of ATK   Horton cycle and you know we love to   have the space program I got a really   good first days again but they're coming   man I've got a friend that's going to go   up in the next little bit Lieutenant   Commander Scott maker tingle is headed   up on a spaceship from Russia but he   would love to come back to the United   States and be able to go up through the   United States so all those jobs I know   we'll come back with you will gather   college is sitting next to you there's   anything we used to do believe in what   you're saying right there   we can do to help you counties are   behind you we can find you low-hanging   fruit to be able to pick off that tree   to hell with jobs just let us know where   we can help thank you Stefan would you   have anything to say well I this story   mr. president are really powerful about   the consequences of the current law and   you hear people's lives that have been   affected in remarkably adverse ways   sometimes you don't think about it   relates to health care whether it's   businesses that haven't been able to   survive are individuals who need to take   three four or five jobs moms that can't   can't be with their kids when I'm on   this is about real people it's about   real patients and so working with you   and your leadership we are really   excited about the opportunity to put in   place a patient-centered system when   patients and families and doctors and   make decisions not Washington DC what   about the concept that and everybody   knows what's happening that Obamacare is   imploded that if we don't do anything   it's not even to be around in another   year the insurance companies are flame   but now it seems to be getting this   wonderful press like it's a wonderful   thing and it's a horrible thing actually   and getting worse and 17 then be by far   the worst year so far yes because a lot   of things will put into 17 but 17 is   going to be worse and i assume 18 will   be worse even than 17 so it's   essentially gone how do you respond to   that because I've been telling you what   do we wait just let it upload and let's   not take the blame I've been telling you   that as an option it's not an option I   like frankly but it's certainly an   option how do you respond to think 18   can be better if the we have limit the   law and we utilize the regulatory   process to make some well I'm not saying   that I'm saying if we don't have limited   to what happens with Obamacare what's   going on with you what you'll see this   is a magnification of all these stories   around the state more businesses being   harmed more individuals not having the   kind   income that they the disposable income   that they would use more moms and dads   not able to care for their kids in the   way that they believed to be most   appropriate more people getting   insurance but no but no care this is   about real people's lives and that's why   it's so important getting insurance but   not being able to use it because it   reductive encephalitis and you hear   these stories when you hang a fortune   for insurance and then you hear how hi   there deductable is unless they have a   tragedy in their family they're never   gonna be able to use it and this moment   has to thirteen thousand dollars before   the insurance kicks in that's what he   has to pay thirteen thousand dollars   just like not having just like not   immature keep working your past dropping   exactly he's been working very hard and   he's doing a great job mr. vice   president you haven't have you just say   mr. president I think what an equipped   these great American see in high relief   is you're someone who puts people over   politics and I just want to thank all of   them for coming and and in front of the   national media talking about the real   world impacts of Obamacare you've said   it consistently over the last two years   that Obamacare has failed but these   people are emblematic of the Americans   that that Obamacare has failed and i   just am so grateful for their time but   so grateful for your compassionate   leadership in in driving the congress   and driving our nation toward a better   healthcare outcomes for them and and   better solutions built on those American   principles of more consumer choices more   free market but also as you said but   caring for the most vulnerable by   allowing our state's to innovate in   Medicaid in ways that will create even   even better a better health care

United States and the Chancellor of   the Federal Republic of Germany   [Music]   thank you very much   [Applause]   Chancellor Merkel it is a great honor to   welcome you to the people's house the   White House our two nations share much   in common including our desire for   security prosperity and peace we just   concluded a productive meeting with the   German and American companies to discuss   workforce development and vocational   training very important words Germany   has done an incredible job training the   employees and future employees and   employing its manufacturing and   industrial workforce it's crucial that   we provide our American workers with a   really great employment outlook and that   includes making sure that we harness the   full potential of women in our economy   my administration is in the process of   rebuilding the American industrial base   a stronger America is in the interest   believe me of the world as a whole I   reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my   strong support for NATO as well as the   need for our NATO allies to pay their   fair share for the cost of the   yes many nations Oh vast sums of money   from past years and it is very unfair to   the United States these nations must pay   what they owe during our meeting I   thanked Chancellor Merkel for the German   government's commitment to increase   defense spending and work toward   contributing at least 2% of GDP I want   to thank the Chancellor for her   leadership in supporting NATO and its   efforts in Afghanistan this has come at   significant cost including the lives of   over 50 German soldiers whose sacrifice   we greatly honor I also appreciate   Chancellor Merkel's leadership along   with the French President to resolve the   conflict in Ukraine where we ideally   seek a peaceful solution most   importantly our two countries must   continue to work together to protect our   people from radical Islamic terrorism   and to defeat Isis   I applaud Chancellor Merkel for   Germany's contributions both civilian   and military as a Counter isis coalition   member we also recognize that   immigration security is national   security we must protect our citizens   from those who seek to spread terrorism   extremism and violence inside our   borders immigration is a privilege not a   right   and the safety of our citizens must   always come first   without question over lunch the   Chancellor and I will talk about our   economic partnership we must work   together towards fair and reciprocal   trade policies that benefit both of our   peoples millions of hardworking US   citizens   have been left behind by international   commerce and together we can shape a   future where all of our citizens have a   path to financial security the United   States will respect historic   institutions and we will also recognize   the right of free people to manage their   own destiny the close friendship between   America and Germany is built on our   shared values we cherish individual   rights we uphold the rule of law and we   seek peace among nations our alliance is   a symbol of strength and cooperation to   the world it is the foundation of a very   very hopeful future thank you to get up   mr. president ladies and gentlemen it is   a great pleasure and privilege to be   here today in the White House together   with President Donald Trump and have a   first personal one-on-one meeting and an   exchange of views in the period leading   up to this visit I've always said it's   much much better to talk to one another   and not about one another and I think   our conversation proved this we talked   about the international situation we   talked about also apprenticeship   programs when we met with CEOs and   apprentices around a round table as   regards the shared interests that we   have I let me look back into the past   we the Germans owe a lot to the United   States of America particularly as   regards the economic rise of Germany   this was primarily due to the help   through the Marshall Plan we were also   able to regain German unity after   decades of the United States standing up   for this together with other allies   and standing by our side during the   period of the Cold War and we are very   gratified to know that today we can live   in peace and freedom as a unified   country due to that so I was gratified   to know that the president underlined   how important he thinks NATO is NATO is   of prime importance for us and it was   not without very good reason that we   said during our summit meeting in Wales   that also Germany needs to increase   expense expenditure we committed to this   2% goal until 2024 we last year we   increase our defense spending by 8% and   we're going to work together again and   again on this and we said that obviously   defence and security has a lot of   different effort assets and facets to it   on the one hand it's supporting missions   at the in Africa for example it's also   promoting development assistance but   it's also helping missions in Africa for   example in trying to stand up for their   own safety and security we continue to   be in conversation what was important   for us today was that we were able to   talk about Afghanistan and talk about   what as a president quite rightly said   the continuing mission in of Germany in   Afghanistan I am very glad that the   United States are intending to continue   to commit to the Afghan mission as well   together we fight against Islamist   terrorism Germany is going to step up   its work and is going to continue its   work in Afghanistan and also in Syria   we're going to monitor the situation   there very closely we're going to work   on political situation and the solutions   in Syria but also in Libya what we   talked about   I am very gratified to know that the   American administration and also the   president personally commit themselves   to the Minsk process we need to come to   a solution of this problem there has to   be a safe and secure solution for a   Ukraine but the relationship with Russia   has to be improved as well once the   situation there on the ground is   clarified Minsk is a good basis but   unfortunately we haven't made yet they   had way that we want to but we are going   to work together with our experts   in the next few months to come on this   issue I'm also here in my capacity as   g20 president you know that we will be   hosting the g20 visit and the g20   summits are this year and I'm very   pleased that the president has committed   to addressing to us attending this   summit we're going to talk at some   length over lunch about the issues and   we say this has trade has to be rendered   fairer there has to be a win-win   situation we can talk about the details   of that we've already seen today when we   had an exchange with our CEOs and also   with our apprentices what sort of   potential we can tap and what sort of   potential our two economies have it's   very moving to see particularly meeting   with these young people what sort of   work towards the future is being done by   our companies there so particularly in   this period where we are transiting from   traditional manufacturing to industry   for dodo capacity-building skills are so   important incidentally not only for   young people but also for those who   maybe have lost their jobs and need to   be rescaled in order to find a job again   and that is an issue I know it's very   important for you here in the United   States but it's also important for us in   Germany so I can say there are a number   of issues where we will continue to   cooperate very closely on the level of   our experts but also in our level we had   a very good first exchange of views so   I'm very much looking forward to the   talks we will have over lunch thinking   thank you very much we'll do a couple of   questions mark halpern   a lot of Americans now have a body like   eight years ago cualquier States what to   do about health so I wanted to help   people for your bottom lines are not   inhalation attached to that thing no one   and I helped her they can't afford it   the gentleman needs to use a microphone   bottom line that's good present trucks   got a different style than most recent   ask us presently wondering what you   think of that time would you think it's   good for the world   or you've got me thank you mark we just   have a really wonderful group of people   meeting later we met with 12 pretty much   knows in Congress you saw that little   while ago and they went from all nose to   all yeses and we have a lot of yeses   coming and it's all coming together   we're going to have great healthcare   it's going to be passed I believe I   think substantially pretty quickly it's   coming together beautifully   you have the conservative groups you   have other groups everybody wants   certain things in the end we're going to   have a great health care plan now I have   to tell you that Obamacare is a disaster   it's failing I was in Tennessee we had a   tremendous crowd the other night and   they have half of the state is uncovered   the insurance companies have left and   the other half has one insurance company   that will probably be bailing out pretty   soon also to have nobody have many   states where they have one you have a   lot of places now where they'll have   none Obamacare will fail it will fold it   will close up very very soon if   something isn't done I've often said   politically the best thing I can do is   absolutely nothing wait one year and   then even the Democrats will come say   please please you got to help us but   it's not the right thing to do for the   people we have a great plan we have a   plan that's getting more and more   popular with the Republican base with   the conservative base and with people   generally the press has covered it very   inaccurately people are truly covered   well and I think it's going to be   something that's going to be a model to   be looked upon   I'll tell you after we're finished   yeah danga soon thank you very much um   well I'm here as Chancellor of the Fed   Republic of Germany   I represent German interests I speak   with the President of the United States   who well   stands up for as is right um American   interests that is our task respectively   and I must say that I was very gratified   to know the very warm and gracious   hospitality with which I been received   here we held a conversation while we   were trying to address also those areas   where we disagree but to try to bring   people together try to show what is our   vantage point what is the American   vantage point and then try to find a   compromise which is good for both sides   because we need to be fair with each   other each and everyone is expecting for   his or her leader that something good   comes out of it for their own people for   Germany I can say what people are   different people have different   abilities have different characteristic   their traits of character have different   origins have found their way into   politics along different pathways and   which well that is diversity which is   good sometimes it's it's difficult to   find compromises but that's what we've   been elected for if everything just went   like that and with that problem we you   didn't need politicians to do these jobs   for doin's main stones please Kristina   dunes from the German press agency madam   Chancellor given the experience of the   GDR you are always saying that you are   so confident that walls can fall also   for how dangerous do you think this   isolationist policy of the US president   is what was the import terrorists that   his plans and also with the fact that he   doesn't think the EU doesn't deal with   the D you in a very respectful way and a   mr. president America first don't you   think that this is going to weaken also   the European Union and why are you so   scared of diversity in the news and in   the media that you speak so often of a   fake news and that things after all in   the out in the end cannot be proven for   example the fact that you have Ben Wyatt   up by mr. Brahma   nice friendly reporter first of all I   don't believe in an isolationist policy   but I also believe a policy of trade   should be a fair policy and the United   States has been treated very very   unfairly by many countries over the   years and that's going to stop but I'm   not an isolationist I'm a free trader   but I'm also a fair trader and our free   trade has led to a lot of bad things   happening you look at the deficits that   we have and you look at all of the   accumulation of debt we're a very   powerful company country we're a very   strong very strong country will soon be   at a level that we perhaps have never   been before   our military is going to be strengthened   it's been depleted but I am a trader I   am a fair trader I am a trader that   wants to see good for everybody   worldwide but I am NOT an isolationist   by any stretch of the imagination so I   don't know what newspaper you're reading   but I guess that would be another   example of as you say fake news okay um   victus informal well allow me if I may   to put it in the following terms we   haven't yet had time to talk at a great   length about economic issues but I would   so say that the success of Germany in   the economic area but also on security   and peace that the success of Germans   have always been one where the German   success is one side of the coin and the   other side of the coin has been European   unity and unity and European integration   that's something of which I'm deeply   convinced and I'm not only saying this   back home I'm saying this here I'm   saying it in the United States and also   here in Washington in my talks with the   president secondly I believe that   globalization or to be shaped in an   open-minded way but also in a very fair   way freedom of movement within the   European Union for example is a very   important element of our economic   progress of peace has   for many many decades the European   countries for many many centuries wage   wars against each other we have to   protect our external borders because and   there we have to work in on the basis of   mutual interest with our neighbors   migration immigration integration has to   be worked on obviously traffickers have   to be stopped but this has to be done   while looking at the refugees as well   giving them opportunities to shape their   own lives where they are help countries   who right now are not in an ability to   do so sometimes because they have civil   war I think that's the right way of   going about it and this is obviously   what we have an exchange of views about   but my position is the one that I've   just set out for you I might add that we   have many plants and factories coming   back into the United States many jobs   are coming back to Michigan to Ohio to   Pennsylvania to a lot of places where   they were losing jobs and we will have a   different policy but it's going to be a   great policy for not only the United   States but a great policy worldwide and   I look very much forward to it Kevin   surelly   [Music]   we   [Music]   what   well Kevin I think we have a very   unified Republican Party after all we   have the presidency we have the house we   have the Senate and we're getting along   very well I will tell you and if you   would have were at the meeting that I   just attended where we took 12 knows or   semi knows no yeses and within a short   period of time everybody was very much   on board and a commitment to vote yes I   think we have a very unified party   I think I actually more unified than   even the election you see when they they   talk about me I seem to be very popular   at least this week within the party   because we have our highest numbers at   the highest numbers that I've ever had   in the party so I think there's a great   unification health care is a very very   difficult subject it's a very complex   subject and it's a subject that you know   goes both ways you do something for one   side and the other side doesn't like it   but it's really something that's come   together very well and I think it's   going to be very very popular extremely   popular on trade with Germany I think   we're going to do fantastically well   right now I would say that the   negotiators for Germany have done a far   better job than the negotiators for the   United States but hopefully we can even   it out we don't want victory we want   fairness all I want is fairness Germany   has done very well in its trade deals   with the United States and I give them   credit for it but and I can speak to   many other countries when you look at   China you look at virtually any country   that we do business with it's not   exactly what you call good for our   workers when you look at the horrible   NAFTA transaction NAFTA has been a   disaster for the United States it's been   a disaster for companies and in   particular it's been a disaster for the   workers a lot of the companies just   moved but the workers are screwing   probably the reason I'm standing there   may be number one that and maybe the   military building up our military which   we will do and we will be stronger than   ever before and hopefully not have to   use it but we will be stronger   and perhaps far stronger than ever   before but it's probably the reason I'm   here is when you talk about trade so I   think that we are going to be a very   different country I think we're going to   be I'm going to have great values but in   terms of our military it's going to be   much stronger and our trade deals are   going to be good solid deals not deals   that lead to closing plants and   tremendous unemployment okay thank you   ma'am then view behind the table when we   speak about trade agreements then the   European Union is negotiating those   agreements for all of the member states   of the European Union but obviously   there's also input by the member states   so they bring to the table what's   important to them we have underlined as   an German industry gem business   community and have made the experience   that any kind of agreement that we have   concluded for example at the very latest   and with South Korea brought us more   jobs actually people were very much   concerned about losing jobs for example   at emotive industry but in the end   agenda particularly has written regard   South Korea in the end it turned out   that both sides benefited and I think   it's only fair that's the purpose of   concluding agreements that both sides   win and that is the sort of spirit I   think in which we ought to be guided in   negotiating any agreement between the   United States of America and the URI   hope that we can resume and the   agreement that we started we have just   now concluded our agreement with Canada   and I hope that we will come back to the   table and talk about the agreement   between you enter the US again mr. Graf   please Thank You Oscar Graf from de   Velde   madam Chancellor a question addressed to   you today we're talking about a trade   the present in the past always said that   mark he doesn't like multilateral trade   agreements but prefers bilateral trade   agreements do you think from the EU   point of view TTIP is a bilateral   agreement with washing on one side the   you on the other side now is the problem   a that America the President of the   United States and the Europeans have a   basically different understanding of   what the EU is all about that's my   question address to you and mr.   president my question addressed to you   from a rejected White House claims is   that the elite wiretapping on on you on   the Trump Tower on Trump organization or   on members of your campaign was that   British intelligence was either   responsible for it or involved in it and   after these claims are rejected what is   your take on that   are there other suspects or do you think   it was it was a mistake to blame British   intelligence for this end by the way my   second question are there from time to   time the tweets that you regret in   inside very seldom very cell there and   you would have so you never would ever   not to have probably wouldn't be here   right now but so very seldom we have a   tremendous group of people that listen   and I can get around the media when the   media doesn't tell the truth so I like   that   as far as wiretapping I guess by you   know this past administration at least   we have something in common perhaps   and just to finish your question we said   nothing all we did was quote a certain   very talented legal mind who was the one   responsible for saying that on   television I didn't make an opinion on   it   that was a statement made by a very   talented lawyer on Fox and so you   shouldn't be talking to me you should be   talking to Fox okay   thank you yeah global does their   president well I believe that the   president has clearly set out his   philosophy as to what traded winds have   to bring about for the American side as   well I personally don't think that   Germany needs to negotiate and not the   European Union we've devolved our   competences to the European Union's of   the European Union or rather the   Commission negotiates on behalf of the   member states so that's not going to   prevent us from concluding agreements   for me indeed this would be then qualify   as a bilateral agreement between the EU   and the United States if we had it but   the question is will it be of benefit to   both countries or not and let me be very   honest very candid a free trade   agreement with the United States of   America has not always been all that   popular in Germany either there have   been less demonstrations against this   vie trade agreement in the United States   than in Europe and also in Germany so I   am very glad to note that apparently the   sort of perspective on that has changed   a little bit at least in Germany too   thank you very much great honor thank   you thank you   [Music]   you
Sbe-lAWX7BQ~Trump TV Network~20170208~FULL: President Donald Trump Speech at Major Cities Police Chiefs Association Conference (2/8/2017)~8806.0~4.52317857742~133.0~18.0~   ladies and gentlemen the President of   the United States   [Music]   thank you very much this is they're   great to be with people I truly feel   comfortable with please sit down they'll   say I didn't get a standing ovation   because they never sat down and I say I   got one standing ovation because they   never sat down but I want to thank you   all i have great great love for what you   do and the way you do it and when I'm   with the police chiefs and I'm with the   Sheriff's of our country and these are   the big ones these are the really big   ones I just want to and I thank you very   much and I thought before I spoke about   what we're really here to speak about I   would read something to you because you   could be a lawyer or you don't have to   be a lawyer if you were a good student   in high school or bad student in high   school you can understand this and it's   really incredible to me that we have a   court case that's going on so long as   you know in Boston we want it with a   highly respected judge and a very strong   opinion but now we're in an area that   let's just say they are interpreting   things differently than probably a   hundred percent of the people in this   room I'd like to almost notice anybody   disagree when I when I read this but I'm   going to read watching what's in dispute   What's in question and you'll see this   it's I n 8 to 12 f 8 USC 1182 f   suspension of entry or imposition of   restrictions by the president okay now   this isn't just me this is for Obama for   Ronald Reagan for the president and this   was done very importantly for security   something you people know more about   then all of us was done for the security   of our nation the security of our   citizens so that people come in who   aren't going to do us harm and that's   why it was done   and it couldn't have been written any   more precisely it's not like oh gee we   wish it were written better was written   beautifully so just listen here's what   it says this is what they're arguing   whenever the president finds that the   entry of any aliens okay the entry the   entry of any aliens or of any class of   aliens so any aliens any class of aliens   into the United States so the entry of   people into the United States let's say   just to be precise of aliens into the   United States so anytime whenever the   president of finds at the entry of any   alien or any class of valence into the   United States would be detrimental to   the interests of the United States right   so if I find as president that a person   or a group of people will be detrimental   to the interests of the United States   and certainly there's lots of examples   that we have but you shouldn't even have   them necessarily he may be and he may by   Proclamation and for such period as he   shall deem necessary now the only   mistake is they should have said he or   she but hopefully it won't be a sheet   for at least another seven years after   that imola   see I just noticed that actually just   notice that I'm saying well this is not   politically correct it's correct but   it's not politically correct you know   this is the old days he made by   Proclamation and for such period as he   shall deem necessary so here it is   people coming in suspend the entry of   all aliens right that's what's us it's   not like again a bad high school student   would understand this anybody would   understand this suspend the entry of all   aliens or any class of aliens as   immigrants or non-immigrants or impose   on the entry of aliens okay so you can   suspend the aliens but you can suspend   the aliens from coming in very strong or   impose on the entry of aliens any   restrictions he may deem to be   appropriate okay so you can suspend you   can put restrictions you can do whatever   you want and this is for the security of   the country which again you're the   Chiefs you're the sheriff's you   understand this and I listen to lawyers   on both sides last night and they were   talking about things that had just   nothing to do with it I listened to a   panel of judges and I'll comment on that   I will not comment on the statements   made by certainly one judge but I have   to be honest that if these judges wanted   to in my opinion help the court in terms   of respect for the court they do what   they should be doing I mean it's it's so   sad they should be you know when you   read something so simple and so   beautifully written and so perfectly   written other than the one statement of   course having to do with Yoshii but when   you read something so perfectly written   and so clear to anybody and then you   have lawyers and you watched I watched   last   night in amazement and i heard things   that I couldn't believe things that   really had nothing to do with what i   just read and I don't ever want to call   a court bias so I won't call it biased   and we haven't had a decision yet but   courts seemed to be so political and it   would be so great for a justice system   if they would be able to read a   statement and do what's right and that   has to do with the security of our   country which is so important right now   we are at risk because of what happened   general Kelly is an extremely talented   man in a very good man now secretary   Kelly Homeland Security we are doing our   job it's a great man we're doing our job   and one of the reasons you probably   heard that we did it so quickly we I   could have in fact I said let's give a   one month notice and then law   enforcement and general Kelly was so   great because he said we totally knew   about it we know about everything we do   things well we did things right but the   law enforcement people said to me oh you   can't give a notice because if you give   a notice that you're going to be really   tough in one month from now or in one   week from now I suggested a month and I   said well what about a week they said no   you can't do that because then people   are going to pour in before the   toughness goes on do you people agree i   mean you know more about law than   anybody law enforcement so I wanted to   give like a month then I said well what   about a week they said well then you're   gonna have a whole pile of people   perhaps perhaps with very evil   intentions coming in before the the   restrictions so there it is folks it's   as plant it's as plain as you can have   it I didn't and I was a good student I   understand things I comprehend very well   okay better than I think almost anybody   and i want to tell you i listen to a   bunch of stuff last night   on television that was disgraceful it   was disgraceful because what I just read   to you is what we have and it just can't   be written any plainer or better and for   us to be going through this and by the   way a highly highly respected judge in   Boston ruled very strongly in our favor   you heard that fact I said to my people   why don't you use the Boston case and   there were reasons why they couldn't use   the Boston case this one came later   various reasons but here's the Boston   case and I won't read that but there   were statements made by that judge who   again highly respected that were right   on there were perfect they were perfect   so I think it's sad I think it's a sad   day I think our security is at risk   today and it will be at risk until such   time as we are entitled and get what we   are entitled to as citizens of this   country as Chiefs a sheriff's of this   country we want security one of the   reasons i was elected was because of law   and order and security it's one of the   reasons i was elected also jobs and lots   of other things but i think one of the   strongest reasons is security and   they're taking away our weapons one by   one that's what they're doing and you   know it and I know it and you people   have been very unhappy for a long period   of time and I can read the polls may be   better than anybody because it seems   that I understood the polls a lot better   than many of the pollsters understood   the pulse assuming they were honest   polls which I you know think probably   many of them weren't I really believe   that but but we need security in our   country we have to allow you folks to do   your job you're great people great   people great men and women and we have   to allow you to do your job and we have   to give you the weapons that you need   and this is a weapon that you need   and they're trying to take it away from   you maybe because of politics or maybe   because of political views we can't let   that happen so with that let's get on to   business right it's really something   thank you I want to thank sheriff Sandra   Hutchins and Chief Tom manga for your   leadership and frankly for the service   you have had great service everyone has   told me about you two legendary people   all of us here today are united by one   shared mission to serve and protect the   public of the United States during my   campaign for now I had the chance to   spend time with law enforcement   officials all across our country they're   the most incredible people you will ever   meet and I just wanted to say to all of   them right now from the bottom of my   heart thank you thank you thank you   [Applause]   there are many actions we in the federal   government can take to help improve   safety in your communities but i believe   that community safety begins with moral   leadership our police officers sheriffs   and deputies risk their lives every day   and they're entitled to an   administration that has their back   [Applause]   the first step in restoring public   safety is affirming our confidence in   the men and women charged with upholding   our laws and i'm going to add justices   judges in that category and i'm very   proud to have picked judge Gossage who i   think is going to be an outstanding   member of the Supreme Court outstanding   [Applause]   so I'd like to begin my remarks with a   declaration issued to all of you and   delivered to every member of the law   enforcement community all across the   United States my message today is that   you have a true true friend in the White   House you have I stand with you I   support our police I support our   sheriff's and we support the men and   women of law enforcement   [Applause]   right now many communities in America   facing a public safety crisis murders in   2015 experienced their largest single   year increase in nearly half a century   in 2016 murders and large cities   continue to climb by double digits in   many of our biggest cities 2016 brought   an increase in the number of homicides   rapes assaults and shootings in Chicago   more than 4000 people were shot last   year alone and the rate so far this year   has been even higher what is going on in   Chicago we cannot allow this to continue   we've allowed too many young lives to be   claimed and you see that you see that   all of them claimed by gangs and too   many neighborhoods to be crippled by   violence and fear sixty percent of   murder victims under the age of 22 or   african-american this is a national   tragedy and it requires national action   this violence must end and we must all   work together to end it whether a child   lives in Detroit Chicago Baltimore or   anywhere in our country he or she has   the right to grow up in safety and in   peace no one in America should be   punished because of the city where he or   she is born every child in America   should be able to play outside without   fear walk home without danger and   attended school without being worried   about drugs or gangs or violence some   many lives and so many people have been   cut short their potential their life has   been cut short so much potential has   been sidelined and so many dreams have   been shattered and broken totally broken   it's time to stop the drugs from pouring   into our country and by the way we will   do that   and I will say this general now   secretary Kelly will be the man to do it   and we will give him a wall and it will   be a real wall and a lot of things will   happen very positively for your cities   your state's believe me the wall is   getting designed right now a lot of   people say oh oh Trump was only kidding   with the wall I wasn't kid I don't kid I   don't kid i watch this and they say I   was kidding now I don't kid I don't kid   about things like that i can tell you   know we will have a wall it will be a   great wall and it will do a lot of will   be a big help just ask israel about   walls do all's work just ask israel they   work if it's properly done it's time to   dismantle the gangs terrorizing our   citizens and it's time to ensure that   every young American can be raised in an   environment of decency dignity love and   support you have asked for the resources   tools and support you need to get the   job done we will do whatever we can to   help you meet those demands that   includes a zero tolerance policy for   acts of violence against law enforcement   we all see what happens   we all see what happens and what's been   happening to you it's not fair we must   protect those who protect us the number   of officers shot and killed in the line   of duty last year increased by fifty-six   percent from the year before last year   in Dallas police officers were targeted   Forex execution think of this who ever   heard of this they were targeted for   execution 12 were shot and five were   killed these heroic officers died as   they lived protecting the innocent   rushing into danger risking their lives   for people they did not even know but   for people that they were determined to   save hats off to you people these slain   officers are an eternal monument to all   of the men and women who protect our   streets and serve our public we will not   forget them and we will not forget all   of the others who made that final   sacrifice in the line of duty God has   blessed our nation to put these heroes   among us those who serve in law   enforcement work long hours you work   long hours I know so many sheriff's so   many chief so many police work long   hours and dangerous hours oftentimes in   difficult conditions and for not that   much pain relative to what you're doing   they do it because they care we must   work with them not against them they're   working against you for many years   they've been working against you we must   support them not undermine them and   instead of division and disunity and   which is so much disunity we must build   bridges of partnership and of trust   those who demonize law enforcement or   who use the actions of a few to   discredit the service of many are   hurting the very people they   say that they want to help when policing   is reduced crime is increased and our   poorest citizens suffer the most and I   see it all the time when the number of   police goes down crime goes up to build   needed trust between law enforcement and   the communities they serve it is not   enough for us to merely talk to each   other we must listen to each other all   of us share the view that those in   uniform must be held to the highest   possible standard of conduct so   important you are the role models to   young Americans all across this country   many of whom want to go into law   enforcement many of whom want to be a   sheriff or a police chief many of whom   they have great respect for you   tremendous respect you don't even   realize it but I will tell you they have   great respect and admiration for the   people in this room and the people that   you represent and don't let anyone ever   tell you different don't let the   dishonest media try and convince you   that it's different than that because   it's not   [Applause]   that is why our commitment to law and   law enforcement also includes ensuring   that we're giving departments the   resources they need to train recruit and   retain talent as part of our commitment   to safe communities we will also work to   address the mental health crisis prison   should not be a substitute for treatment   we will fight to increase access to   life-saving treatment to battle the   addiction to drugs which is afflicting   our nation like never ever before ever   [Applause]   I've been here two weeks I've met a lot   of law enforcement officials yesterday   brought them into the Oval Office I   asked a group what impact do drugs have   in terms of a percentage on crime said   75 to 80 percent it's pretty sad we're   going to stop the drugs from Poirier and   we're going to stop those drugs from   poisoning our youth from poisoning our   people we're going to be ruthless in   that fight we have no choice and we're   going to take that fight to the drug   cartels and work to liberate our   communities from the terrible grip of   violence you have the power and   knowledge to tell general Kelly now   secretary Kelly who the illegal   immigrant grant gang members are now you   have that power because you know them   you're there you're local you know the   illegals you know them by their first   name you know them by their nicknames   you have that power the federal   government can never be that precise but   you're in the neighborhoods you know the   bad ones you know the good ones I want   you to turn in the bad ones call   secretary Kelly's representatives and   we'll get them out of our country and   bring them back where they came from and   we'll do it fast   you have to call up the federal   government Homeland Security because so   much of the problems you look at Chicago   and you look at other places so many of   the problems are caused by gang members   many of whom are not even legally in our   country and we will work with you on the   front lines to keep America safe from   terrorism which is what I began this   with terrorism a tremendous threat far   greater than people in our country   understand believe me I've learned a lot   and the last two weeks and terrorism is   a far greater threat than the people of   our country understand but we're going   to take care of it we're going to win   we're going to take care of it folks let   today be the beginning of a great   national partnership let today serve as   a great call to action and let this   moment represent a new beginning in   relations between law enforcement and   our communities I want you to know the   American public totally stands with you   I want you to know the American people   support you I want you to know how proud   we are truly proud to know you we   applaud your efforts we thank you for   your service and we promise that you   will always find an open door at the   White House an open invitation to our   great cups and sheriff's nationwide   they're great people you are great   people

uHM4-ti4bZ4~Trump TV Network~20170706~WATCH: President Trump Full Press Conference with President Andrzej Duda 7/6/17~2137.0~4.73626375198~85.0~6.0~   Xon see most distinguished about the   president ladies and gentlemen it is my   great pleasure to welcome to war so to   welcome to Poland the president of the   United States of America mr. Donald   Trump I am delighted with this visit   this visit in war so which is one of the   first international visits paid by mr.   president Trump visited stresses our   bond and the high quality of the   alliance between Poland and the United   States it also demonstrates that we are   and actually mutually assess each other   as loyal partners of those who cooperate   on many different areas including the   area of security within NATO alliance   and today this was one of the topics of   our discussion that we had during our to   that meeting with mr. president followed   by a plenary session of our two   delegations we talked about the presence   of American soldiers in Poland we talked   about transiting security of our part of   Europe including the eastern flank of   NATO we discussed generally the security   situation in this part of Europe apart   from that we mentioned the situation in   Ukraine we talked about the upcoming   zapad 17 military exercise which will   take place in Belarus we also talked   about contracts connected with the   modernization of the Polish Armed Forces   we discount the already entered into   agreement between Poland and the United   States and on purchasing Patriot   missiles so we discount the   implementation of the visa program we   also discussed the implementation of   another program code-named hamada we   discussed about all the things that were   implemented in the next few years as   regards to ending the security of Poland   ladies and gentlemen I am delighted   after these conversations I have a   feeling that the United States is   thinking very seriously and mr.   president a lambic thinking very   seriously about Homeland Security and   he's also thinking very seriously about   that United States of America our loyal   ally the president expressed very   strongly that strength of the Polish   community in the United States of our   Polonia of the Polish Americans whom he   met even before elections and mr.   president when again thank you very much   for that thank you for noticing   also the contribution of publish   Americans and Polish people in the   development in the buildings of the   prosperity of the United States of   America but apart from that ladies and   gentlemen we discussed economic   contracts not only military ones but all   of those connected with security we   spoke at length about LNG gas deliveries   to Poland I'm really pleased with the   first shipment of LNG gas and arrived to   Poland on the 8th of July from the   United States this dam has turned out   hugely successful there were no problems   whatsoever there were no barriers to   shape that death to our LNG terminal   through the LNG terminal internal   moisture this opens up the path to more   contracts I hope that in the near future   there will be a long term contract   entered into for LNG gas deliveries from   the United States and that through this   we will diversify sources of supply of   the hugely important raw material to   Poland in a few moments together with   mr. president we will attend the three   seas made where we were also going to   discuss issues pertaining to energy   security and pertaining to the   development of the transatlantic bond   between Europe and the United States we   will also talk about the developments in   infrastructure in our part of Europe in   Central Europe but we also going to   discuss the development of the European   Union because all the three C's   initiative countries are in member   states and whenever we talk about the   implementation of the cohesion policy   then   we are looking at it from the European   Union perspective and we wanted to   implement it through the development of   infrastructure along the north-south   axis to increase competitiveness of our   countries and at the same token to   increase the competitiveness of the   entire European Union I hope that we'll   be able to do that also in cooperation   of the United States according to the   win-win principle that is going to be   beneficial both from the United States   and for our countries mr. president once   again welcome I'm hugely delighted with   your visit in Poland and in my capacity   as president they're beautiful and thank   you very much on the behalf of the   entire polish submersion of the Polish   people for coming to Poland Thank You   mr. president   the President of the United States our   job from the floor is yours well thank   you very much president Duda and for   your really gracious hospitality we've   had a wonderful stay it's been quick but   the people of Poland have been so   fantastic and as you know polish   Americans came out in droves they voted   in the last election and I was very   happy with that result so I just want to   thank you and I want to thank them it's   true honor to be here in Poland it's a   majestic nation it really is it's a   spectacular place some of the most   beautiful sights that we just saw coming   over really very inspirational you're   rich in history and you have absolutely   an unbreakable spirit that's something   we've learned for over the course of   many years president I concluded a   productive meeting in which we   reaffirmed our enduring bonds of   friendship and have United our citizens   for a long time but we've never been   closer to Poland I think that we are   right now Poland is not only a great   friend but a truly important ally and a   partner with respect to our military   we've had great cooperations   with Poland we fought shoulder to   shoulder many different encounters   particularly grateful for the active   role Poland is taken in helping to   defeat Isis where we've made tremendous   strides tremendous gains   which you'll be hearing about over the   next period of time and other terrorist   organizations Poland's been right there   with us by training Iraqi Special Forces   and flying reconnaissance missions and   just about any time we requested they   were their brave Polish soldiers a   fought and work side by side with   Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan and on   behalf of all Americans I want to salute   you I want to thank you very very   special people I also want to thank the   Polish people for their kindness to more   than 5000 American troops at a   stationed in your country our strong   alliance with Poland and NATO remains   critical to deterring conflict and   ensuring that war between great powers   never again ravages Europe and that the   world will be a safer and better place   America is committed to maintaining   peace and security in Central and   Eastern Europe we're working with Poland   in response to Russia's actions and   destabilizing behavior and we're   grateful for the example Poland to set   for every member of the NATO alliance by   being one of the few nations that   actually meets its financial obligations   as you know I've been pretty hard on   some of the members of NATO for not and   the money is pouring in I can tell you I   was criticized mr. president but I can   also say that the people at NATO aren't   criticizing me they're very happy the   money has been pouring in in the last   year far greater than it ever would have   been it is past time for all countries   and all countries in the NATO alliance   to get going and to get up to their   obligations but I can say that Poland   has been right there and you will even   exceed that number and I appreciate that   very much and so do a lot of other   countries during our meeting I   congratulated president Duda on Poland's   recent election to the United Nations   Security Council   we also discussed our mutual commitment   to safeguarding the values at the heart   of our alliance freedom sovereignty and   the rule of law Poland joins the   security-cam   to let a very critical time it's a   critical time frankly for the world   because you see what's going on not only   must we secure our nation's from the   threat of terrorism but we must also   confront the threat from North Korea and   that's what it is it's a threat and we   will confront it very strongly president   Duda and I call on all nations to   confront this global threat and publicly   demonstrate to North Korea that there   are consequences for their very very bad   behavior we also discussed the ongoing   humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and   the need to defeat Isis and other   terrorist groups where they control   territory and populations we have fought   very hard and very powerfully against   Isis since I've been president and we've   made tremendous gains far greater than   has ever been made with respect to that   group while the cities of Raqqa and   Mosul will soon be liberated from these   murders criminals and butchers we   recognize that Syria requires a   political solution that does not advance   Iran's destructive agenda and does not   allow terrorist organizations to return   we also reaffirmed that any nation that   values human life can never tolerate the   use of chemical weapons and we won't   tolerate it either finally we agreed to   work to expand commerce between our   countries we strongly support the three   seas initiative and America stands ready   to help Poland and other European   nations diversify their energy supplies   so that you can never be held hostage to   a single supplier or as we sometimes   call it a monopoly I'm pleased to report   that the first shipment of American   liquefied natural gas arrived in Poland   last month and there will be many more   coming maybe we can get your price up a   little bit but that's okay   it's tough negotiator we look forward to   making the economic ties between the   United States and Poland even stronger   through trading relationships and that   is a balanced and reciprocal one we want   reciprocal trade relationships we don't   have too many of them I said before that   the United States has made some of the   worst trade deals ever in history that's   going to change that's going to change   the friendship between our peoples dates   all the way back to the American   Revolution a long time I look forward to   speaking more about these enduring bonds   of faith and freedom when I address the   entire polish nation in just a little   while here we have a big crowd mr.   president is going to be I think they're   showing up to you not for me right we're   going to have a big crowd that's what   the word is so president do - thank you   again for welcoming milani and myself to   your beloved homeland together we can   make the partnership between our two   nations stronger than ever before   special people special place and it's an   honor to be here thank you   thank you for them simply plant   adventure but Oklahoma cloth laughter   Thank You mr. break then now we have   time to take four questions two from   each side let us start with a guest from   the United States is there any question   from the US side   Thank You mr. president   in light of North Korea's latest ICBM   testing do you think they're beyond   redemption or is there a chance they   might actually make a u-turn and are you   willing and ready to launch military   action against them and if I may if I   may I have to ask about this since you   started the whole wrestling video thing   what are your thoughts about what has   happened since then   I mean CNN went after you and has   threatened to expose the identity of a   person they said was responsible for it   I like your father yeah I think what CNN   did was unfortunate for them as you know   now they have some pretty serious   problems they have been fake news for a   long time they've been covering me in a   very very dishonest way do you have that   also by the way mr. Posner what CNN and   and others I mean I know there's NBC is   equally as bad despite the fact that I   made them a fortune with The Apprentice   but they forgot that but I will say that   CNN has really taken it too seriously   and I think they've hurt themselves very   badly very very badly and what we want   to see in the United States is honest   beautiful free but honest press we want   to see fair press I think it's a very   important thing we don't want fake news   and by the way not everybody is fake   news but we don't want fake news bad   thing   very bad for our country as far as North   Korea is concerned I don't know we'll   see what happens   I don't like to talk about what I have   planned but I have some pretty severe   things that we're thinking about that   doesn't mean we're going to do them I   don't draw red lines president Obama   drew a red line and I was the one that   made it look a little bit better than it   was but that could have been done a lot   sooner and you wouldn't have had the   same situation that you have right now   in Syria that was a big mistake but I   think we'll just take a look at what   happens over the coming weeks and months   with respect to North Korea it's a shame   that they're behaving this way but they   are behaving in a very very   dangerous manner and something will have   to be done about it thank you thank you   David and mr. president if we're   speaking about press freedoms your party   has significantly clamped down on press   freedoms in the last year and now   appears to be weakening the power of the   national courts as well do you think   that people who live in other modern   democracies including some Americans are   wrong to criticize you for limiting   which reporters can cover the   parliaments sounds a funny OPA that so   to respond to your question sir media   order is a very significant thing indeed   and when we look at the situation in the   United States when we look at the   situation in Poland in every case you   can see a lot of pathologies I can give   you an example of one of Polish   magazines which convert to TV channels   of two different broadcasters and as an   example one of those broadcasters did   not report about my visit to Croatia the   visit of the President of the Republic   of Poland to Croatia a very important   one which was preparing that this wreath   is coming because this broadcaster did   not really like me as the presenter   Poland so I'm permanently criticized by   that broadcaster but I believe this is a   reality this is the right of the media   in Poland we've got an absolute liberty   and freedom of the media problem the   word there during previous governments   also when the former president was in   office when one of the magazines of top   magazine was visited by a special   services in order to take away   recordings which were compromising for   all the politicians of the previous   ruling party so that was when the   freedom was under threat but now we have   got absolute freedom of the media we do   do respect the freedom of the media we   do take care of the interests of the   Republic of Poland and of Polish people   Thank You mr. president now the   questions on the Polish side the first   question polish television one question   please   newest book tech I represent a polish   television one question concerning   energy because both of you mentioned   energy sector and the deliveries of LNG   so my first question goes to president   Trump in what type respective do you   think a permanent contract could be   entered into to ensure LNG gas   deliveries American delivers to Poland   and the question to president Duda could   Poland become a certain hub for the   transportation of American gets up to   three state country question I think we   can enter a contract for LNG within the   next 15 minutes do you have anybody   available to negotiate it will take   about 15 minutes you know we're becoming   a great exporter of energy very soon   will be a very great exposure of energy   and we've taken a lot of unnecessary   regulations out of our process and we   are doing things that we haven't been   able to do for a long time so we're a   were blessed with great land we didn't   even know it 15 years ago in terms of   what was underneath our feet and   certainly we have found out through   technology that we are truly blessed to   have this incredible wealth under our   feet and we are going to be an exporter   of energy it's already happening and   anytime you're ready we can do   additional contracts we've already done   the one but we can do many additional   contracts thank you   some of you banks one of the other   ladies and gentlemen I can give you the   following answer it is not the President   of the United States and the President   of Poland who are going to sign the   long-term contract for LNG gave delivery   to Poland but the contract will be   signed by companies by a Polish company   and an American company and visit how it   will be proceeded what is most important   however the most important thing is very   green lies given by the US government by   the US administration that there is an   incentive given by American for us to   buy gas from the United States and an   hour signed on the Polish side on the   side of the Polish Authority there was   also the green light and there is   interest in this particular thing   I count that after relevant negotiations   I know that those negotiations are   already ongoing I believe that after the   conclusion of those negotiations there   will be a long term contract for us   LNG deliveries to our LNG terminals   phenols gym and entering the second part   of your question can we become a hub   through which gas LNG gas American gas   will flow to Central Europe I am   convinced that the answer is yes I'm   convinced that the answer is yes and   today we are going to talk about this   also and under the framework of the   three C's initiative this is also   connected with the establishment of an   energy corridor of a gas corridor along   the north-south exit but also in the   future this could and Sherpa have   alternatives supplies of the Russian   supplies alternative supplies for   Ukraine this is of primary importance   and this is what we discuss today with   mr. president Trump I'm convinced that   the future is very rosy on this one   right the contracts will be entered into   and of course we on our part according   to the needs are going to develop our   capacities as regards of the reception   of the LNG gas from the US and some   other directions media is free in public   so now the question for the private to   broadcaster TVN mr. Ramnath thank you   very much and questions to both   president you mentioned military   cooperation I'd like to find out from   both of you president whether during   your exchange were there any concrete   guarantees extended concerning the   presence of American troops in Poland as   long as there is threat from the Russian   side and how do you see the future   presidents the future of the presence of   American troops in Poland   well we didn't discuss guarantees and we   weren't really in that position to   discuss guarantees but certainly we've   been here for a long time we have quite   a few troops here up to 5000 and we   will continue to do that and we will   continue to work with Poland but we did   not discuss guarantees now on your   adductors arrows mark   well sir with mr. president the topic   that we discussed first and foremost was   the security situation that we have here   we discussed in the context of what is   happening in our part of Europe in the   context of the up at 17:00 maneuvers   which we have already mentioned and from   that point of view there is no doubt   that the presence of American troops and   NATO troops in Poland today is still so   justified from this perspective if we   add to this the situation that we are   seeing in Ukraine all the time and it is   absolutely clear that we are going to   discuss it further with mr. president we   made an initial agreement to make next   year in the White House we agreed that I   will pay a visit to the United States   next year for the details will be worked   out later on but that year is important   both for us hold and for the Polish   Americans because next year we are going   to celebrate the centennial of Colin's   regaining of independence and I would   like me myself and mr. president to   stress together the important for that   year because this shows the contribution   of the Polish people to the welfare of   the United States over the last 100   years and last question   American media very briefly please   because the president has got to attend   a three summit a minute   the presence of President Trump go to   collect the next drill a stopped on the   question first a two-part question if I   may   will you once and for all yes or no   definitively say that Russia interfered   in the 2016 election well I think it was   Russia and I think it could have been   other people in other countries it could   have been a lot of people interfere I've   said it very I said it very simply I   think it could very well have been   Russia but I think it could well have   been other countries and I won't be   specific but I think a lot of people   interfere I think it's been happening   for a long time it's been happening for   many many years now the thing I have to   mention is that Barack Obama when he was   president found out about this in terms   of if it were Russia found out about it   in August now the election was in   November that's a lot of time he did   nothing about it why did he do nothing   about it he was told it was Russia by   the CIA as I understand it it was well   reported   and he did nothing about it they say he   choked well I don't think he choked I   think what happened is he thought   Hillary Clinton was going to win the   election and he said let's not do   anything about it had he thought the   other way he would have done something   about it so he was told in early August   by presumably the CIA that Russia was   trying to get involved or meddling   pretty strongly with the election he did   nothing about it   the reason is he thought Hillary was   going to win and if he thought I was   going to win he would have done plenty   about it so that's the real question is   why did he do nothing from August all   the way to November 8 why did he do   nothing his people said he choked I   don't think you jump to the follow-ups   for you on that mr. president you again   say you think it was Russia your   intelligence agencies have been far more   definitive they say it was Russia why   won't you agree with them I'll tell you   let me just start off by saying I heard   it was 17 agencies I said boy that's a   lot to even have that many intelligence   agencies right let's check it and we did   some very heavy research it turned out   to be three or four   it wasn't 17 and many of your   compatriots had to change the reporting   and they had to apologize and they had a   correct now with that being said   mistakes have been made I agree I think   it was Russia but I think it was   probably other people and/or countries   and I see nothing wrong with that   statement nobody really knows nobody   really knows for sure I remember when I   was sitting back listening about Iraq   weapons of mass destruction how   everybody was 100% sure that Iraq had   weapons of mass destruction guess what   that led to one big mess they were wrong   and it led to a mess so it was Russia   and I think it was probably others also   and that's been going on for a long   period of time but my big question is   why did Obama do nothing about it from   August all the way to November 8th he   did nothing about it   and it wasn't because he choked and   before   you talk about being angry President   Obama Thank You Velma but we must we   must go thank you very much thank you   very much dear lady it was two questions   thank you very much Jim quiescent then   Tom Thank You president thank you to the   members of the delegation thank you   ladies and gentlemen   thank you everybody very much   you
UL605KJKc2Y~Trump TV Network~20170405~President Donald Trump Press Conference With King Abdullah Of Jordan 4/5/2017~16525.0~4.27007293701~224.0~50.0~   ladies and gentlemen the President of   the United States and His Majesty King   Abdullah the second heaven hallow Sain   thank you very much your majesty   thank you for being with us today very   much appreciate it this is our second   meeting since my inauguration but our   first at the White House very special   place I can tell you that I've gotten to   know it well   long hours very special it's really an   honor to welcome you here today but   before we begin let me say a few words   about recent events yesterday chemical   attack a chemical attack that was so   horrific in Syria against innocent   people including women small children   and even beautiful little babies their   deaths was an affront to humanity these   heinous actions by the Assad regime   cannot be tolerated the United States   stands with our allies across the globe   to condemn this horrific attack and all   other horrific attacks for that matter   your majesty Jordanians are known for   their legendary hospitality and we will   do our very best to be equally gracious   hosts they're also known however I have   to say this for their fighting ability   and you are a great warrior and we   appreciate it thank you   two historical ties and close friendship   between our two countries dates back   three-quarters of a century in that time   the Middle East has faced many periods   of crisis and unrest perhaps never like   it is today however through them all   America has looked to Jordan as a valued   partner an advocate for the values of   civilization and a source of stability   and hope I am deeply committed to   preserving our strong relationship which   I will and to strengthening America's   long-standing support for Jordan and you   do have tremendous support within our   country I can tell you that as we know   the Middle East and the entire world is   faced with one of its gravest threats in   many many years since the earliest days   of the campaign against Isis Jordan has   been a staunch ally and partner and we   thank you for that   Jordanian servicemembers have made   tremendous sacrifices in this battle   against the enemies of civilization and   I want to thank all of them for their in   Carole ejust incredible courage so many   have been lost and we pay homage so many   in King Abdullah America is blessed with   a thoughtful and determined partner he   is a man who has spent years commanding   his country special forces he really   knows what being a soldier is that I can   tell you and he knows how to fight the   king has been a leader in calling for a   plan to defeat Isis once and for all and   I'm with you on that   we're both leaders on that believe me   that's what we speak about today and   that is what we are going to do and it   will be a shorter fight that a lot of   people are thinking about believe me   we've made tremendous strides as we   discussed as you know we had a very very   fine delegation come over from Egypt and   also from Iraq and they said more has   been done in the last six weeks that has   been done in years with the previous   administration and believe me we're   going to keep it that way   we will destroy Isis and we will protect   civilization we have no choice we will   protect civilization King Abdullah and I   also discussed measures to combat the   the evil an ideology that inspires Isis   and plagues our planet in addition we   also acknowledge the vital role that   Jordan has played in hosting refugees   from the conflict in Syria we have just   announced that the United States will   contribute additional funds to Jordan   for humanitarian assistance this aid   will help countries like Jordan host   refugees until it is safe for them to   return home the refugees want to return   home I know that from so many other   instances they want to return back to   their home and that's a goal of any   responsible refugee policy finally as we   discussed to advance the cause of peace   in the Middle East including peace   between the Israelis and the   Palestinians and I'm working very very   hard on trying to finally create peace   between the Palestinians and Israel and   I think we'll be successful I hope to be   successful I can tell you that the King   has been an ATAR a really tireless   advocate for a solution he's going to   help me with that and help me at the   highest level and we will be consulting   with him very closely in the days ahead   King Abdullah I want to take this   opportunity to thank you for your   partnership working together the United   States and Jordan can help bring peace   and stability to the Middle East and in   fact the entire world and we will do   that thank you very very much for being   with us   mr. president thank you for such a kind   and warm welcome to the White House I   finally remember the meetings we've had   many years ago and more recently several   months ago you've always been a generous   host and have always looked after us we   are very delighted with the way the   discussions have gone so far and we're   delighted to be here in such a wonderful   setting in such a beautiful day which i   think is a tremendous mark of how we are   going to move into the future we've had   a very good round of talks today and I'm   looking forward to continuing these   discussions later on in our meetings   after the press conference what I do   want to say is how much we deeply   appreciate the close relations we have   with the United States with you mr.   president with the American people this   is a strategic partnership that we call   and keep very close to our hearts and it   is a partnership on so many levels that   we will continue I think with the frank   discussions that we had today to improve   on as we face the challenges of the   future and I am very delighted for your   vision your holistic approach to all the   challenges in our region and to the   decades dedication of your team in being   able to translate your policy into   actions successfully hopefully as we   move forward the challenges we face   today are many and not exclusive to my   region as I've just mentioned they are   global and particularly the threats to   global security terrorism has no borders   no nationality no religion and therefore   joint action with a holistic approach as   I had just mentioned mr. president is   crucial I am very delighted that you   have the vision to be able to move in   that direction and I think that the   world will be in a very good place as we   move with all these challenges ahead no   doubt with all the challenges that we   face in the world the role of the u.s.   is key to all the issues that we have   around the world but it's not just the   fact that we should expect United States   to do all the heavy lifting the heavy   lifting has to be done by all of us in   the international community to support   the United States in being able to   translate that vision into the writer   so there's a lot of responsibility for   all of us in the international community   to support the president administration   and American people to bring brighter   days to all of us we are very encouraged   with the president's determination to so   support Arab and Muslim states in the   fight against terrorism but it is not   only the fight of terrorism inside of   our societies but we as Arab Muslim   States standing behind the international   community in being able to defeat this   international scourge in Syria we need a   political solution that ends the   conflict in the country and preserve its   unity and territorial integrity as the   president mentioned the issue we   discussed with the israeli-palestinian   conflict which is essentially the core   conflict in our region and the   president's early engagement is   beginning in bringing the Palestinians   and Israelis together has been a very   encouraging sign for all of us and I   think so it was that initiative that   allowed us at the Arab summit last week   to extend through the Arab Peace   Initiative the message of peace to   Israel which we all hopefully will work   together to make that come about all   Arab countries relaunch the peace   additions as I said last week it offers   a historic reconciliation between Israel   and the Palestinians as well as all   member states of the Arab League it is   the most comprehensive framework for   lasting peace and it ensures statehood   for the Palestinians but also security   acceptance and normal ties for Israel   with all AB countries and hopefully all   Islamic countries so we appreciate your   commitment and all these issues where   others have failed you will find a   strong ally in Jordan supporting you in   all your policies and if I may just say   as you have on on Syria and the gas   attack unfortunately as you and I both   agree this is another testament to the   failure of the international diplomacy   to find the solutions to this crisis but   I believe under your leadership we will   be able to unravel this very complicated   situation this has been going on ongoing   for seven years now has descended into   proxy wars from different parties with   dubious agendas but at the end of the   day is you pointed out mr. president is   the civilians women and children that   are paying   the heaviest price this is happening on   our watch on our conscious as well as   the you will gobble community and I know   the passion and emotion that the   president has expressed in how this   should not be tolerated whatsoever and   this stressful that sorry this threshold   of in humanity and savagery that have   been crossed every day is something that   I know the president will not allow to   happen wherever it may be and I fully   support and endorse the president in   this issue so I want to thank you sir   because you have the outlook of looking   not just at the Syrian challenges but   that of Iraq Israel Palestine Libya and   everything that is in our region so I   think your message to all of us is a   message of hope and that's what I take   away from this conference and I thank   you for all what you have done so far   and all that you will do sir all right   we'll take a few questions a Julie pace   thank you sir I'm questions on Syria for   both leaders but if I could start with   you mr. president you've condemned the   chemical attacks in Syria but you also   appeared in your statement yesterday to   pin some of the blame on the Obama   administration you're the president now   do you feel like you bear responsibility   for responding to the chemical attacks   and does the chemical attack cross a red   line for you   well I think the Obama administration   had a great opportunity to solve this   crisis a long time ago when he said the   red line in the sand and when he didn't   cross that line after making the threat   I think that set us back a long ways not   only in Syria but in many other parts of   the world because it was a blank threat   I think it was something that was not   one of our better days as a country so I   do feel that Julie I feel it very   strongly   into the chemical I now have   responsibility and I will have that   responsibility and carry it very proudly   I will tell you that it is now my   responsibility it was a great   opportunity missed as you know I'll be   meeting with the president of China very   soon in Florida and that's another   responsibility we have and that's called   the country of North Korea we have a big   problem we have somebody that is not   doing the right thing and that's going   to be my responsibility but I'll tell   you that responsibility could have made   been made a lot easier if it was handled   years ago before I move on to the King   can I just quickly ask you if the   chemical attack crosses a red line for   you it crossed a lot of lines for me   when you kill innocent children innocent   babies babies little babies with a   chemical gas that is so lethal if people   were shocked to hear what gas it was   that crosses many many lines beyond a   red line many many lines thank you very   much and your majesty if I could ask   about refugees your country has really   borne the brunt of the refugee crisis in   Syria the president has signed travel   bans that would block Syrians from   coming to the US if that goes into   effect what would the impact on your   country and across the region be well I   think as the president pointed out most   if not all Syrian refugees actually want   to go back to Syria and that what we're   working with the United States and the   international community is to be able to   stabilize the refugees in our country   give them the tools so that as we're   working with the solutions in Syria we   have the ability to be able to send them   back as a positive influence into their   economies and again the president and   the Europeans are being very afford   leading in being able to look after a   host community tremendous burden on our   country but again tremendous   appreciation to the United States and   and the Western countries for being able   to help us in dealing with that   directed your majesty how does the   outcome of the recent Arab summit help   the u.s. in its policy to advance   palestinian-israeli negotiations well as   I said the Arab Peace Initiative   came out with a resounding resolution to   offer peace to the Israelis to make them   feel that they're accepted into the   neighborhood and to be able to support   the president as he brings both parties   together and again I have to remind   people that very early on there was an   early engagement by the president and   his team to the Israelis and the   Palestinians to be able to see what he   can do to bring them together it is the   core conflict for a lot of us in the   region the president knows this he has   his instincts in the right place and   working with his team our job as I said   is to do the heavy lifting the ABS are   prepared to do whatever they can to   bring Israelis and Palestinians together   under the leadership of the president   thank you John yang Thank You mr.   president I'd like to follow up on   Julie's question and press you a little   more on Syria   you how will you distinguish your policy   in your actions on Syria from the in   action that you criticize the view of   the previous administration you say it's   now your responsibility what should we   see there what should we look for that   will be different and your majesty I'd   like to ask you what gives you this is   now your second meeting with the   president what gives you the optimism   that that mr. Trump will succeed in the   israeli-palestinian conflict where so   many others have failed before him to be   a broker for peace I like to think of   myself as a very flexible person I don't   have to have one specific way and if the   world changes I go the same way   I don't change well I do change and I am   flexible and I'm proud of that   flexibility and I will tell you that   attack on children yesterday had a big   impact on me big impact that was a   horrible horrible thing and I've been   watching it and seeing it and it doesn't   get any worse than that and I have that   flexibility and it's very very possible   and I will tell you it's already   happened that my attitude toward Syria   and Assad has changed very much and if   you look back over the last few weeks   there were other attacks using gas   you're now talking about a whole   different level so as you know I would   love to have never been in the Middle   East I would love to have never seen   that whole big situation start but once   it started we got out the wrong way and   Isis formed in the vacuum and lots of   bad things happened I will tell you what   happened yesterday   is unacceptable to me can I follow up   sir yes last year you seemed to be   reluctant to get involved   to intervene in Syria directly is that   one thing that's changed after yesterday   well one of the things I think you've   noticed about me is militarily I don't   like to say where I'm going and what I'm   doing and I watched past administration   say we will attack at such-and-such a   day at such-and-such an hour and you   being a warrior you would say why are   they saying that and I'm sure you set   back in Jordan you said why are they   saying that I watched Mosul where the   past administration were saying we will   be attacking in four months and I said   why are they doing that then a month   goes by and they say we will be   attacking in three months and then two   months and then we will be attacking   next week and I'm saying why are they   doing that and as you know Mosul turned   out to be a much harder fight than   anyone thought and a lot of people have   been lost in that fight I'm not saying   I'm doing anything one way or the other   but I'm certainly not going to be   telling you as much as I respect you   John thank you sir I think on behalf of   the president what I saw was an early   engagement by the president his team   with all of us on the way in the region   about the challenges between Israelis   and Palestinians I have the honor of   seeing the president and his team again   in January where this was discussed the   president understands the nuances and   the challenges I think he has the   courage and a dedication to be able to   do this like I said before all of us   have a responsibility to help the   president pushes over the finish line   and so his team has been in region   they've been talking to all the partners   and it is our job to facilitate the   atmospherics between his race and   Palestinians to move together and give   the support to the president to be able   to smooth the edges over between   Israelis and Palestinians to achieve   this and the president understands that   if we don't solve this problem how are   we going to win the global fight against   terrorism which is his number one   priority so this is a core issue that he   understands and I think he has the   commitment and he has my full support   for the assess he does from many many   countries in our region and   have to just say that the world is a   mess I inherited a mess whether it's the   Middle East whether it's North Korea   whether it's so many other things   whether it's in our country horrible   trade deals I inherited a mess we're   going to fix it we're going to fix it   okay thank you thank you majesty you   touch upon the subject now but if I   asked you to look forward how do you see   the future of fighting terrorism post   Raqqa and Mosul especially the role that   Jordan will play in eastern part of Iraq   and you believe the real battle will   start then and if I may mr. president   you know very well that the Iranian   militias and Hezbollah has been propping   the Syrian regime for a while over a few   years now will you go after them what   message will you give them today and   will you work with the Russians to stop   to ground the Syrian air force and to   establish safe zones thank you   well the first part is that we are   seeing very recently tremendous gains on   the ground in Raqqa and Mosul again I   think as the president alluded to is   very difficult to put timelines on this   issue because the battlespace is always   very fluid but I think that the war is   being won on the ground having said that   terrorists are on the move they'll be on   the move inside of Iraq and inside of   Syria so that we have to make sure that   we adapt our plans accordingly and they   move beyond borders beyond our region   and elsewhere so as we and and and the   administration have discussed it's this   holistic approach how do we fight them   wherever they are and I think that is   the understanding terrorists have no   respect for for borders and and and   religions and people so it's that the   seriousness of how we do this holistic   approach that I've mentioned several   times and what I'm really delighted is   that the understanding by the president   and the administration in how to deal   with this globally and I think you're   seeing a move in the right direction   because the policy now is being charted   out and my discussions with the defense   secretary in the foreign secretary   allows us to be then able to decide how   we adapt our   in the region to be able to come in line   with international diplomacy the Iran   deal made by the previous administration   is one of the worst deals I have ever   witnessed and I've witnessed some   beauties it's one of the worst deals   I've ever witnessed it should never have   been made   it was totally one-sided against the   United States and frankly against much   of the Middle East I will do whatever I   have to do they have a deal it was some   people say not done properly even in the   form of its finalization there was no   vote from Congress there was no real   ratification but I will do what I have   to do with respect to the Iran deal as   far as Isis is concerned the United   States will work with whoever it's   appropriate to work with to totally   eradicate Isis and other terrorists and   by the way Isis is one group but others   have formed frankly they're all over the   place we will do what we have to do to   eradicate terrorism   Iranian militias in Syria support in the   Syrian regime separate of the nuclear   deal what message do you have with him -   you will see they will have a message   you will see what the message will be   okay thank you thank you all very much   thank you thank you   you   you

proud to welcome the Falcons of the   United States Air Force Academy to the   White House most important   congratulations to you all   coach Calhoun you and your team had   quite a season like good Air Force guys   you flew under the radar to victory   you know we're buying a lot of those   under the radar planes you know in fact   you can fly over the radar you're still   not going to detect them it costs a lot   of money I'll tell you that this week   our Republican team had its own victory   under the radar that is a very important   thing for the men and women of the   United States military and it's a very   important thing for the people of our   country in our new budget and it's been   a very hotly contested budget because as   you know we have to go through a long   and rigorous process but we've ended   years of painful cuts to our military   and just achieved a 21 billion dollar   increase in defense spending   and we didn't do any touting like the   Democrats did by the way not only did we   achieve this massive and badly needed   increase in defense but we did so   without having to put in place an equal   increase in non-defense spending   breaking the so called parity rule that   was breaking our budget and degrading   our military and that's not happening   anymore that I can tell you with surety   so you're going to have the money we   need and the equipment we need there   will never be a time I will tell you   this when we will be spending more money   we are doing the necessary money we're   going to have the finest equipment of   all types whether it's airplanes or   ships or equipment in general that we've   ever had in the history of our country   we are taking care of our military and   we're not going to go back to what we   were doing for the last long period of   time our military is going to be taken   care of that I promise you thank you   thank you folks   with this major investment in America's   national defense a core campaign promise   of mine we are at last reversing years   of military cuts and showing our   determination and resolve to the entire   world and believe me the entire world is   watching and we have resolved like never   ever before   these long-awaited increases will make   America more safe and more secure and   give our amazing servicemembers the   tools equipment training and resources   they need and they very much deserve to   top that we achieved the single largest   increase in border security funding in   ten years so we have more money now for   the border that we've gotten in ten   years of the Democrats didn't tell you   that they forgot in their notes they   forgot to tell you that with enough   money to make a down payment on the   border wall   I think they'll go back and check their   papers this includes swiftly replacing   ineffective and failing fencing and   walls with an unbreakable barrier so   we're putting up a lot of new walls in   certain areas we're putting up a   tremendous amount of money to fix the   existing structures that we have some of   which we can keep into the future   they're in good shape but we have to   bring them back to the highest level   we'll be doing that with this payment   and make no mistake we are beginning to   build the wall and we will keep out the   gang members criminals drug and human   traffickers that threaten our citizens   and that threaten our security any   member of Congress who opposes our plans   on border security and I know these   folks didn't is only empowering these   deadly and dangerous threats and we will   not put up with it and the public won't   put up with it this bill also includes   important health care resources for our   great coal miners who have not been   treated well but now they're being   treated very well and continues to make   funding available so inner city children   here right in the nation's capital can   go to the school of their choice choice   is so important after years of partisan   bickering and gridlock this bill is a   clear win for the American people   we brought lawmakers together from both   sides of the aisle to deliver a budget   that funds the rebuilding of the United   States military makes historic   investments in border security and   provides health care for our minors and   school choice for our disadvantaged   children very importantly there is no   long term bailout for the insurance   companies that the Democrats desperately   wanted to subsidize donors the badly   failing   makohe do you know what a donor is   fellas you'll learn when you get a   little older you'll learn about donors I   used to be a donor used to get   everything I wanted this is what winning   looks like something that you folks   really know a lot about what a record   the Falcons had ten wins and only three   losses a tremendous achievement and they   played tough tough teams and they played   some teams that were slightly larger   right coach slightly coach the same boy   that big but you'd beat him right you'd   beat him he knows how to win just spoke   to Bob Kraft of the New England Patriots   right and he gave you a little pep talk   yes and he's a big fan too and but we   know one thing as good as this coaches   even he says he's not replacing   Belichick is that right but someplace   else you're going to stay where you are   you better stay right where you are   coach right   don't let find out you better never   leave us he better never leave   and the Falcons not only that but   finished very strong you ended the   season with six straight victories   including a win in the Arizona Bowl   which is a big deal who do you beat   South Alabama South Alabama good team   too but we all know the games that   you're most proud of I shouldn't say   this you know cuz I love these teams too   should I say it I thought they were   great Americans coach   alright the games they were most they   beat Navy good team do I have to give   the score yes beat Navy 28 to 14 and you   beat West Point 31 to 12 does anybody   feel guilty that you made me do that no   it's a great privilege for me for the   first time to present you the   commander-in-chief's trophy my first   time established in 1972 the   commander-in-chief's trophy has been   claimed by the air force academy this is   pretty hard to understand you didn't go   under the radar coach I mean it's really   an amazing thing a record listen to this   20 times you have the record more than   any other of the service academies   pretty amazing as the United States Air   Force celebrates its 70th birthday this   year this trophy will serve as a point   of pride for the Academy's cadets   graduates and all of the members past   and present of the United States Air   Force that we love   I love the effort I love those planes I   love buying those planes at a reduced   price I have been really negotiated I   have cut billions I have to tell you   this and they can check right Martha I   have cut billions and billions of   dollars off plane contracts sitting here   do they give me credit no but that's   okay so we can either do one of two   things we can buy more planes or we can   cut the budget what do you want to do   she says buy more planes I think you're   right nowadays I think you're right as   proud as we are of your achievements on   the field we are even more proud of you   and all of those who attend our service   academies in general for your   distinguished service on behalf of our   great nation whenever an Air Force crew   flies you'll always find a powerful   symbol of American strength and American   prestige from the a-10 warthog stand up   Martha this is what she flied she said   please please mr. president order more   you think that's just a great plane   right it does some pretty big damage I   know that okay and we're working on that   okay   she loves that plane - the f-16 viper   not as good not as good - the b-2 spirit   a little different but still no it's   pretty good though   our proud aircrafts and airmen fill our   friends and you wouldn't believe it with   the level of confidence and they really   truly strike fear into the hearts of our   enemies and I tell you we have so many   of those planes coming in we have planes   coming in from all different corners and   all different sizes and speeds and with   different capabilities you're going to   be very proud of what we're doing with   the Air Force and wherever thank you   thank you and wherever our space and   cyber airmen operate world-class systems   for modern warfare the full might of   America will be on display for all to   see   with the new budget increases we have   achieved in our spending bill we'll be   able to purchase the greatest planes   ever built including the f-35 that is   some plane and the next generation of   military aircraft we will maintain and   expand our superiority in the air and   our ability to protect and project   America's vital security interests just   across the river not far from the White   House stands a soaring tribute to the   men and women of the United States Air   Force the three arching spires of the   Air Force memorial represent the core   values of this noble branch of our armed   forces integrity first service before   self excellence in all

thank you very much   for joining us I'd first like to start   by extending my sincere thanks to   President Trump for inviting me down to   Washington any day I get to visit our   southern neighbors is a good day in my   books particularly when it's so nice and   warm compared to what it is back home we   are suffering under a significant winter   storm that's hitting our Atlantic   provinces particularly harsh so I just   want to send everyone back at home my   thoughts as they shovel out and impress   on everyone to stay safe no please no e   moi I have only been coming out the   president of myself have had a very   productive first meeting today we had   the opportunity to get to know one   another better and more importantly we   had the opportunity to talk about the   unique relationship between Canada and   the United States depends on both sides   of the 49th parallel have understood   that the bond between our nation's is a   special one no other neighbors in the   entire world are as fundamentally linked   as we are we've fought in conflict zones   together negotiated environmental   treaties together including 1991's   historic air quality agreement and we've   entered into groundbreaking economic   partnerships that have created good jobs   for both of our peoples Canadians and   Americans alike share a common history   as well as people-to-people ties that   make us completely and totally   integrated our workers are connected by   trade transportation and cross-border   Commerce our communities rely on each   other for security stability and   economic prosperity our families have   long lived together and worked together   we know that more often than not   our victories are shared and just as we   celebrate together so too do we suffer   loss and heartbreak together through it   all the foundational pillar on which our   relationship is built is one of mutual   respect and that's a good thing because   as we know relationships between   neighbors are pretty complex and we   won't always agree on everything but   because of our deep abiding respect for   one another we're able to successfully   navigate those complexities and still   remain the closest of allies and friends   make no mistake at the end of the day   Canada and the US will always remain   each other's most essential partner and   today's conversations have served to   reinforce how important that is for both   Canadians and Americans as we know 35 US   states list Canada is their largest   export market and our economies benefit   from the over 2 billion dollars in   two-way trade that takes place every   single day millions of good middle-class   jobs on both sides of the border depend   on this crucial partnership maintaining   strong economic ties is vital to our   mutual success and we're going to   continue to work closely together over   the coming years so the Canadian and   American families can get ahead come   newly civil your Canada lucrazon to   Google as we know 35 US states list   Canada as their largest export market   and our economies benefit from the over   2 billion dollars in two-way trade that   takes place every single day millions of   good middle-class jobs on both sides of   the both sides of the border depend on   this crucial partnership maintaining   strong economic ties is vital to our   mutual success and week we're going to   continue to work closely together over   the coming years so that Canadian and   American families can get ahead   the president Trump and I discussed   today at the end of the day the   President and I share a common goal we   both want to make sure that hard-working   folks can go to work at a good job put   food on the table for their families and   save up to take a vacation every once in   a while that's what we're trying to do   here today we reiterated that our   nation's are committed to collaborating   on energy infrastructure projects that   will create jobs while respecting the   environment and as we know investing in   infrastructure is a great way to create   the kind of economic growth that our   countries so desperately need in that   same vein we know that ensuring equal   opportunities for women in the workforce   is essential for growing the economy and   maintaining American and Canadian   competitiveness on the world stage as   such the president and I have agreed to   the creation of the Canada United States   council for advancement of women   entrepreneurs and business leaders this   initiative is more than just about   dollars and cents this is about ensuring   that women have access to the same   opportunities as men and prioritizing   the support and empowerment of women who   are senior business leaders and   entrepreneurs in doing so will grow the   Canadian and American economies and help   our businesses prosper Ethan animal the   please don't Trumpy muah finally   president Trump and myself have agreed   to work together to fight against the   traffic of opioids across our border the   rise of illegal use of opioids in our   society is nothing less than a tragedy   we will do everything we can to ensure   the safety of Canadians and Americans   ladies and gentlemen president Trump I   know that if our countries continue to   work together our people will greatly   benefit from this cooperation it time   and again that in order to tackle our   most pressing issues both foreign and   domestic we must work with our closest   allies learn from   and stand in solidarity as a united   voice with a level of economic and   social integration that is unmatched on   the world stage canada and the united   states will forever be a model example   of how to be good neighbors Winston   Churchill once said that long Canadian   frontier from the Atlantic to the   Pacific Oceans guarded only by   neighborly respect and honorable   obligations is an example to every   country and a pattern for the future of   the world that my friends is the very   essence of the canada-us relationship I   look forward to working with President   Trump over the coming years to nurture   and build upon this historic partnership   once again it's a tremendous pleasure to   be here in Washington merci beaucoup   thank you very much okay we'll take a   couple of questions Scott them and Scott   Thank You mr. president q you just spoke   about the desire to build bridges   although there are some notable and   philosophical differences between   yourself and Prime Minister Trudeau I'm   curious as you move forward on issues   from trade to terrorism how do you see   this relationship playing out and are   there any specific areas with which   during your conversations today you each   decided to perhaps alter or amend your   stance is already on those sensitive   issues like terrorism and immigration   and Prime Minister Trudeau while only in   its infancy so far how do you see this   relationship compared to that under the   Obama administration well we just began   discussions we are going to have a great   relationship with Canada may be as good   or better hopefully than ever before we   have some wonderful ideas on immigration   we have some I think very strong very   tough ideas on the tremendous problem   that we have with terrorism and I think   when we put them all together which will   be very very quickly we have a group of   very talented people we will see some   very very obvious results we're also   doing some cross-border things that will   make it a lot easier for trade and a lot   better and a lot faster for trade we   have through technology we have some   really great ideas and they'll be   implemented fairly quickly one of the   things we we spoke about was the fact   that security and immigration need to   work very well together and certainly   Canada has emphasized security as we   look towards improving our immigration   system and remaining true to the values   that we have and we had a very strong   and fruitful discussion on exactly that   there's plenty that we can draw on each   other from in terms of how we move   forward with a very similar goal which   is to create free open societies that   keep our citizens safe and that's   certainly something that we're very much   in agreement on Tony with Charles   mr. president mr. prime minister and mr.   prime minister could you answer in   English and French for us please a   little bit of a follow-on on my American   colleagues question a president Trump   you seem to suggest that Syrian refugees   are a Trojan horse for potential   terrorism while the Prime Minister hugs   refugees and welcomes them with open   arms so I'd like to know are you   confident the northern border is secure   you never be totally confident but   through the incredible efforts already I   see it happening of formerly general   Kelly now secretary Kelly we have really   done a great job where were actually   taking people that are criminals very   very hardened criminals in some cases   with the witch with a tremendous track   record of abuse and problems and we're   getting them out and that's what I said   I would do I'm just doing what I said I   would do when we won by a very very   large electoral college vote and I I   knew that was going to happen I knew   this is what people were were wanting   and that wasn't the only reason that   wasn't my only thing and that we did so   well odd but that was something that was   very important and I said we will get   the criminals out the drug lords the   gang members we're getting them out   general Kelly who's sitting right here   is is doing a fantastic job and I said   at the beginning we are going to get the   bad ones the really bad ones we're   getting them out and that's exactly what   we're doing I think that in the end   everyone's going to be extremely happy   and I will tell you right now a lot of   people are very very happy right now   Canada has always understood that   keeping Canadians safe is one of the   fundamental responsibilities of any   government and that's certainly   something that we're very much focused   on at the same time we continue to   pursue our policies of openness towards   immigration refugees without   compromising security and   part of the reason where we were been   successful in doing that over the past   year welcoming close to 40000 Syrian   refugees is because we have been   coordinating with our allies the United   States and around the world to   demonstrate that security comes very   very seriously to us and that's   something that we that we that we   continue to deal with sickly okay it is   clear that if you want to have a healthy   and secure society you're safe society   you have to make sure that you maintain   that you focus on security and we have   welcomed refugees from Syria we have   been very successful but we have always   taken our responsibility towards   security very seriously and our allies   including the United States understand   this focus very well and they have done   so since the very beginning this place   you president Trump now that you've been   in office and received intelligence   briefings for nearly one month what do   you see as the most important national   security matters facing us and Prime   Minister Trudeau you've made very clear   that Canada has an open-door policy for   Syrian refugees do you believe that   president Trump's moratorium on   immigration has merit on national   security grounds okay thank you many   many problems when I was campaigning I   said it's not a good situation now that   I see it including with our intelligence   briefings we have problems that a lot of   people have no idea how bad they are how   serious they're not only internationally   but when you come right here where I   mean obviously North Korea is a big big   problem and we will deal with that very   strongly we have problems all over the   Middle East we have problems just about   every corner of the globe no matter   where you look at a great meeting this   weekend with Prime Minister Abe a of   Japan and got to know each other very   very well extended weekend really   we were with each other for long periods   of time and our staffs and   Representatives but on the home front we   have to create borders we have to let   people that can love our country inn and   I want to do that we won't have a big   beautiful open door and we want people   to come in and come in our country but   we cannot let the wrong people in and I   will not allow that to happen during   this administration and people the   citizens of our country want that and   that's their attitude too I will tell   you we are getting such praise for our   stance and it's a stance of common sense   maybe a certain toughness but it's   really more than toughness it's a stance   of common sense and we are going to   pursue it vigorously and we don't want   to have our country have the kinds of   problems that you're witnessing taking   place not only here but all over the   world we won't stand for it we won't put   up with it we're just not going to let   it happen we're going to give ourselves   every bit of chance so that things go   well for the United States and they will   go well thank you canada and the united   states have been neighbors a long time   and Canadians and Americans have stood   together work together at home and   around the world we fought and died   together in battlefields in World War   One World War two in Korea in   Afghanistan but there have been times   where we have differed in our approaches   and that's always been done firmly and   respectfully the last thing canadians   expect is for me to come down and   lecture another country on how they   choose to govern themselves my role and   our responsibility is to continue to   govern in such a way that reflects   canadians approach and be a positive   example in the world   hey Fisher left all this fish I like oh   nice Thank You mr. prime minister well   ask my question in French first in debt   for you I'll get again in English mr.   Wu's mr. Prime Minister I heard you   correctly you said that Canadian   businesses Canadian workers are   concerned for other businesses and for   their work and jobs concerning the   renegotiation of NAFTA so what   guarantees did you get from this   government that we will keep our jobs   and our businesses in the even ago she   ation of NAFTA mr. president again   during the last three months you have   denounced NAFTA you have talked over and   over about the Mexican portion of the   agreement very little about the Canadian   one my questions in in two short part is   is Canada a fair trader and when you   talk about changes to NAFTA concerning   Canada are we again are you talking   about big changes or small chances thank   you bb shall music first of all Alicia   thank you for your question it is a real   concern for many Canadians because we   know that our economy is very dependent   on our advanced our relationship with   the United States goods and services do   cross the border each way every single   day and this means a lot of millions of   jobs for Canadians and good jobs for   Canadians so we are always focusing on   these jobs but there are also good jobs   millions of jobs in the united states   that depend on those relationships   between our two countries so when we sit   down as we did today and   as our teams will be doing in the weeks   and months to come we will be talking   about how we can continue to create good   jobs for our citizens on both sides of   the border and during this exercise we   continue to understand that we have to   allow this free flow of goods and   services and we have to be aware of the   integration of our economies which is   extremely positive for both our   countries and this is the focus that we   will have in the coming weeks and months   to come where of the fact that much of   our economy depends on good working   relationship with the United States good   integration with the American economy   and the fact is millions of good jobs on   both sides of the border depend on the   smooth and easy flow of goods and   services and people back and forth   across our border and both President   Trump and I got elected on commitments   to support the middle class to work hard   for people who need a real shot at   success and we know that by working   together by ensuring the continued   effective integration of our two   economies we are going to be creating   greater opportunities for middle-class   Canadians and Americans now and well   into the future I agree with that one   hundred percent we have a very   outstanding trade relationship with   Canada will be tweaking it will be doing   certain things that are going to benefit   both of our countries it's a much less   severe situation than what's taking   place on the southern border on the   southern border for many many years the   transaction was not fair to the United   States as an extremely unfair   transaction we're going to work with   Mexico we're going to make it a fair   deal for both parties I think that we're   going to get along very well with Mexico   they understand and we understand you   probably have noticed that Ford is   making billion   of dollars of new investments in this   country you saw in tell the other day   announced that because of what I've been   doing and what I'm doing in terms of   regulation lowering taxes etc they're   coming in with billions and billions of   dollars of investment in thousands and   thousands of jobs General Motors   likewise is expanding plants and going   to build new plants fiat-chrysler was at   a meeting where they're doing the same   Jack Ma we have so many people that want   to come into the United States it's   actually very exciting I think it's   going to be a very exciting period of   time for the United States and for the   workers of the United States because   they have been truly the forgotten man   and forgotten women it's not going to be   forgotten anymore believe me so a   relationship with Canada's outstanding   and we're going to work together to make   it even better and as far as the   southern border is concerned we're going   to get that worked out we're going to   make it fair but we are going to make it   so that everybody is happy it's very   important to me thank you thank you very   much thank you ladies and gentlemen   thank you very much   you

President of   the United States   thank you very much   thank you   friends members of Congress ambassadors   veterans and most especially to the   survivors here with us today it's an   honor to join you on this very very   solemn occasion I'm deeply moved to   stand before those who survived   history's darkest hour your cherished   presence transforms in this place into a   sacred gathering thank you Tom Bernstein   Alan Hulk Sara Bloomfield and everyone   at the Holocaust Memorial Council and   museum for your vital work and tireless   contributions We are privileged to be   joined by Israel's ambassador to the   United States friend of mine done a   great job and said some wonderful words   Ron Dermer the State of Israel is an   eternal monument to the undying strength   of the Jewish people the fervent dream   that burned in the hearts of the   oppressed is now filled with the breath   of life and the Star of David waves atop   a great nation arisen from the desert to   those in the audience who have served   American uniform our country eternally   thanks you we are proud and grateful to   be joined today by veterans of the   Second World War who liberated survivors   from the camps your sacrifice helped   save freedom for the world for the   entire world   [Applause]   sadly this year marks the first day of   remembrance since the passing of Elie   Wiesel a great person a great man his   absence believes an empty space in our   hearts but his spirit fills this room is   the kind of gentle spirit of an angel   who lived through hell and whose courage   still lights the path from darkness   though le story is very well known by so   many people it's always worth repeating   he suffered the unthinkable horrors of   the Holocaust his mother and sister   perished in Auschwitz he watched his   father slowly dying before his own young   eyes in Buchenwald he lived through an   endless nightmare of murder and death   and he inscribed on our collective   conscience the duty we have to remember   that long dark night so as never to   again repeat it they're survivors in   this hall through their testimony   fulfilled the righteous duty to never   forget and engrave into the world's   memory the Nazi genocide of the Jewish   people you're witnessed evil and what   you saw is beyond description beyond any   description many of you lost your entire   family everything and everyone you loved   gone you saw mothers and children led to   mass slaughter you saw the starvation   and the torture you saw the organized   attempt   at the extermination of an entire people   and great people I must add you survived   the ghettos the concentration camps and   the death camps and you persevered to   tell your stories you tell of these   living nightmares because despite your   great pain you believe in Ellie's famous   plea that for the dead and the living we   must bear witness that is why we are   here today to remember and to bear   witness to make sure that humanity never   ever forgets the na dzis master six   million Jews two out of every three Jews   in Europe were murdered in the genocide   millions more innocent people were   imprisoned and executed by the Nazis   without mercy without even a sign of   mercy yet even today there are those who   want to forget the past we're still   there are even those filled with such   hate total hate that they want to erase   the Holocaust from history those who   deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to   this horrible evil and will never be   silent we just won't we will never ever   be silent in the face of evil again   [Applause]   denying the Holocaust is only one of   many forms of dangerous anti-semitism   that continues all around the world   we've seen anti-semitism on University   campuses in the public square and in   threats against Jewish citizens even   worse it's been on display in the most   sinister manner when terrorists attacked   Jewish communities or when aggressors   threaten Israel with total and complete   destruction this is my pledge to you we   will confront anti-semitism   [Applause]   we will stamp out prejudice we will   condemn hatred we will bear witness and   we will act as president of the United   States I will always stand with the   Jewish people and I will always stand   with our great friend and partner the   State of Israel   [Applause]   so today we remember the six million   jewish men women and children whose   lives and dreams were stolen from this   earth we remember the millions of other   innocent victims the nas ease so   brutally targeted and so brutally killed   we remember the survivors who bore more   than we can imagine we remember the   hatred and evil that sought to   extinguish human life dignity and   freedom but we also remember the light   that shone through the darkness we   remember sisters and brothers who gave   everything to those they love survivors   like Steven Springfield who in the long   Death March carried his brother on his   back as he said I just couldn't give in   we remember the brave souls who banded   together to save the lives of their   neighbors even at the risk of their own   life and we remembered those first   hopeful moments of liberation when at   long last the American soldiers arrived   in camps and cities throughout occupied   Europe waving the same beautiful flags   before us today speaking those three   glorious words you are free   it is this love of freedom this embrace   of human dignity this call to courage in   the face of evil that the survivors here   today have helped to write unto our   hearts the Jewish people have endured   oppression persecution and those who   have sought and planned their   destruction yet through the suffering   they have persevered they have thrived   and they have enlightened the world we   stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit   of the Jewish people I want to close   with a story enshrined in the museum   that captures the moment of liberation   in the final days of the war it is the   story of ger decline a young Jewish   woman from Poland some of you know her   gurdas family was murdered by the Nazis   she spent three years imprisoned in   labor camps and the last four months of   the war on a terrible death march she   assumed it was over at the end on the   eve of her 21st birthday her hair had   lost all of its color and she weighed a   mere 68 pounds yet she had the will to   live another day it was tough good or   later recalled the moment she realized   that her long-awaited deliverance had   arrived she saw a car coming towards her   many cars had driven up before but this   one was different on its hood in place   of that wretched swastika was a bright   beautiful gleaming why   star two American soldiers got out one   walked up to her the first thing Gerda   said was what she had been trained to   say we are Jewish you know we are Jewish   and then he said so am i it was a   beautiful moment after so much darkness   after so much evil as Gerda took this   soldier to see other prisoners the   American did something she had long   forgotten to even expect he opened the   door for her in Goethe's words that was   the moment of restoration of humanity of   humaneness of dignity and a freedom but   the story does not end there because as   some of you know that young American   soldier who liberated her and who showed   her such decency would soon become her   husband a year later they were married   in her words he opened not only the door   for me but the door to my life and to my   future girl has since spent her life   telling the world of what she witnessed   she like those survivors were among us   today has dedicated her life to shining   a light of hope through the dark of   night your courage strengthens us your   voices inspire us and your stories   remind us that we must never ever shrink   away from telling the truth about evil   in our time evil is always seeking to   wage war against the innocent and to   destroy all that is good and beautiful   about our common humanity but evil can   only thrive in darkness and what you   have brought us today is so much more   powerful than evil you brought us hope   hope that love will conquer hatred that   right will defeat wrong and that peace   will rise from the ashes of war each   survivor here today is a beacon of light   and it only takes one light to   illuminate even the darkest space just   like it takes only one truth to crush a   thousand lives and one hero to change   the course of history we know that in   the end good will triumph over evil and   that as long as we refuse to close our   eyes or to silence our voices we know   that justice will ultimately prevail so   today we mourn we remember we pray and   we pledge never again thank you god   bless you and God bless america thank   you very much thank you   [Music]   thank you

mean each generation   of Americans toward a more free and more   prosperous future among these Patriots   are women like the legendary Abigail   Adams right who during the founding   urged her husband to remember the rights   of women he was very much a pioneer in   that way we've been blessed with   courageous heroes like Harriet Tubman   who escaped slavery   [Music]   and went on to deliver hundreds of   others to freedom first in the   Underground Railroad and then as a spy   for the Union Army she was very very   courageous believe me and we've had   leaders like susan b anthony have you   heard of susan b anthony I'm shocked   that you've heard him who dreamed of a   much more equal and fair future an   America where women themselves as she   said helped to make laws

Manhattan American   women in every generation of shown   extraordinary grit courage and devotion   our present generation stands on the   shoulders of these Titans and that's   what they were and are

access to affordable   childcare   we want every daughter an America to   grow up in a country where she can   believe in herself believe in her future   and follow her heart and realize her   dreams

early this year I met with a remarkable   group of leaders they were women   entrepreneurs from all across the   country they started their businesses   from absolutely nothing and today have   grown them into successful enterprises   that employ hundreds and in certain   cases even thousands of people just   think of what our country could achieve   if we unleashed the power of women   entrepreneurs nationwide think of   [Music]   so the man I stand before you as   president but if I weren't president I   wouldn't be happy to hear that statement   that would be a very scary

chance to   succeed to do that we must believe in   each other and we must dare to dream of   a better brighter and more prosperous   future for all of our citizens we have   no choice that's what we

WvF9A8Q1yTo~Trump TV Network~20170223~President Donald Trump Leads a Listening Session with Manufacturing CEOs (2/23/2017)~10792.0~4.58139514923~231.0~27.0~   ladies and gentlemen the President and   Vice President of the United States   [Music]   [Music]   thank you everybody please sit down   well thank you very much it's great   honor to have everybody and some of the   great people in the world of business   many of you I know many of you I know   from reading all of our wonderful   magazines and business magazines in   particular so it's an honor to have you   with us today bringing manufacturing   back to America creating high wage jobs   was one of our campaign promises and   themes and it resonated with everybody   it was really something what happened   states that hadn't been won in many many   years were they came over to our fold a   lot of it had to do with the jobs and   other reasons but jobs and I'm   delivering on everything that we've said   in fact people are saying they had never   seen so much happen in 30 days of a   presidency we've delivered on a lot and   I think mark can explain and mark can   probably say some of the things we're   doing for the auto industry are going to   be doing that for many of the industries   as you know the United States lost one   third of our manufacturing jobs since   NAFTA that's an unbelievable number and   statistic and seventy thousand factories   closed since China joined the WTO   seventy thousand factories so when I   used to give that statistic I used to   talk about it and I always thought it   was a typo I said has to be a typo I   tell Wilbur Wilbur that can't be right   70000 think of it seventy thousand   factories so you say what are we doing   my administration's policies and   regulatory reform tax reform trade   policies will return significant   manufacturing jobs to our country   everything's going to be based on   bringing our jobs back the good jobs the   real jobs they've left and they're   coming back they have to come back   you've already seen companies such as   Intel Ford mark has been great GM   walmart Amgen amazon Fiat they came the   other day they're going to   make a tremendous investment in the   country Kerry and many others announced   significant new investments in the   United States for example Ford is doing   700 million in Michigan creating seven   hundred new jobs as a vote of confidence   it was actually stated a vote of   confidence we have many other companies   doing the same thing carry as you know   and I got involved very late almost like   by two years late but many of the jobs   that were leaving from Mexico they're   bringing back at least 800 jobs they're   bringing it back and they actually never   got to leave I have no idea what they   did with the plant in Mexico but we'll   have to ask them because it was largely   built General Motors is investing 1   billion in u.s. plants adding or keeping   7000 jobs and going to be investing a   lot more than that over the next fairly   short period Lockheed Martin has 18   they've just announced eighteen hundred   new jobs and us plants were doing a   great job and we started negotiating   with them a little bit on the f-35   they've cut their price a little bit   thank you very much she's tough but it   worked out well I think for everybody   and I think I have to say this Marilyn   you've gotten a lot of credit because   what you did was the right thing so we   appreciate it cut a price set over 700   million right by over 700 million do you   think Hillary would have asked for 700   mo boy I hope you I assume you wanted   her to win but you know what you're   going to do great and you're going to   make more planes it's going to work out   the same or better Walmart announced   plans to create 10000 jobs and all of   those jobs are going to be in the United   States sprint softbank is putting in 50   billion dollars because of our election   in the United States over the next four   years to create 50000 jobs they've been   terrific by the way and we have many   others many of you are in the room and   you know exactly what I'm talking about   we have many many other companies and   we're very happy today we have 24 CEOs   from the largest menu   facturing companies in the country and   even in the world they represent people   just in this room nearly 1 trillion of   sales and 2 million employees large   majorities of which are in the United   States they share our commitment to   bring manufacturing back and to create   jobs in this country which has been the   biggest part of my campaign I would say   the border big part military strength   big part and jobs big part I don't want   to say which is most important I guess   we always have to say defenses may be   the most important but many of you take   care of our defense you make great   products nobody makes the products that   we do for military nobody and in fact a   couple of countries who were not allowed   to buy from us I gave them hello Jeff I   gave them authorization you can only buy   from us I want them to buy from us they   were getting planes from other countries   because our and their allies but they're   going to be buying from us from now on   and I just want to thank all of my   people myself has been amazing Gary as   you know you all know Gary from Goldman   Gary Cohen and we're really happy just   paid 200 million dollars in tax in order   to take this job by the way   which is very much unlike Gary but he's   great and he'll be criticized by the   media because he's getting paid 197   thousand dollars i'll say he really   wanted that money which he gave up i   think he gave up did you give that up   Gary I think so yeah it was one of those   things but that's right I want to thank   Wilbur has been so fantastic i've known   Wilbur for so long and he's a great guy   great negotiator but a very fair   negotiator and he's going to be doing   things that the deals we have with other   countries are unbelievably bad we don't   have any good deals in fact I'm trying   to find a country where we actually have   a surplus of trade as opposed to it   everything's our deficit with mexico we   have 70 billion in deficits trade   deficits and it's unsustainable we're   not going to let it happen can't let it   happen we're going to have a good   relationship with Mexico I hope and if   we don't we don't but we can't let that   happen seventy billion dollars in trade   deficits and that doesn't include the   drugs that poor across the border like   like water so we can't let that happen   with China we have close to a 500   billion dollar trade deficit so we have   to do something I spoke to the president   I spoke to many people we're going to   work on that very very hard and we're   going to do things that are the proper   things to do but I actually said to my   people find a country where we actually   do well so far we haven't found that   country it's just losses with everybody   and we're going to turn that around I   want to thank Jared Kushner who's been   so involved in this and all of my guys   we have a great team we have a team of   all-stars and we've been credit really   been given credit for that right now Rex   who as you know he's in Mexico I said   that's going to be a tough trip because   we have to be treated fairly by Mexico   that's going to be a tough trip but he's   over there with general Kelly who's been   unbelievable at the border you see   what's happening at the boy   all of a sudden for the first time we   getting gang members out we're getting   drug lords out we're getting really bad   dudes out of this country and at a rate   that nobody's ever seen before and   they're the bad ones and it's a military   operation because what has been allowed   to come into our country when you see   gang violence that you've read about   like never before all of the things much   of that is people that are here   illegally and they're rough and they're   tough but they're not tough like our   people so we're getting amount I thought   what we could do is maybe we'll start   with Ken on my left and we'll go around   the room and introduce yourselves to the   press lots of media one thing we have   lots of media how are you treats me   that's one that treats me very nicely   one of the fuse hi and we'll just start   around go around the room and then we'll   talk privately without the press and   we're going to figure out how to bring   many many millions of jobs more back to   the United States okay can go ahead   Thank You mr. president it's good to be   here came for you from working home   Thank You mr.

xCutqlmiHgA~Trump TV Network~20170324~WATCH: President Trump Speaks After Pulling Healthcare Bill (3/24/2017)~9913.0~4.45851516724~198.0~31.0~   trash your help a bit of metal thank you   very much we were very close was a very   very tight margin we had no Democrats   support we had no votes from the   Democrats they weren't going to give us   a single vote so it's a very difficult   thing to do I've been saying for the   last year and a half that the best thing   we can do politically speaking is let   Obamacare explode it is exploding right   now it's many states have big problems   almost all states have big problems I   was in Tennessee the other day and   they've lost half of their state in   terms of an insurer had no insurance and   that's happening too many other places i   was in kentucky the other day and   similar things are happening so   obamacare is exploding with no democrat   support we couldn't quite get there with   just a very small number of those short   in terms of getting our bill fair a lot   of people don't realize how good our   bill was because they were viewing phase   one but when you add phase two which was   mostly the signings of secretary price   who's behind them phase one but when you   add phase two which was mostly the   signings of secretary price who's behind   them and you add phase three which I   think we would have gotten it became a   great Phil premiums would have gone down   been very stable would have been very   strong but that's okay but we were very   very close and again I think what will   happen is Obamacare unfortunately will   explode could have a very bad year last   year you had over a hundred percent   increases in various places in Arizona   understand it's going up very rapidly   again like it did last year last year   was 116 besaid many places fifty sixty   seventy percent I guess it averaged   whatever the average was very very high   and this year should be much worse for   Obamacare so what would be really good   with no democrat support if the   democrats when it explodes which you   will soon if they got together with us   and got a real health care field I'd be   totally open to it and I think that's   going to happen i think the losers are   Nancy Pelosi and Chuck children because   now they own Obamacare they own it 100%   donuts and this is not a Republican   health care this is not anything but a   Democrat health care and they have   Obamacare for a little while longer   until it ceases to exist which it will   at some point in the near future and   just remember this is not a love Elvis   is there bill you know when they all   become civilized and get together and   try and work out a great health care   bill for the people of this country   we're open to it was totally open to it   I want to thank the Republican Party I   want to thank Paul Ryan he was very very   hard I will tell you that he worked very   very hard Tom Price and mike pence was   right here I'll vice president I great   vice president everybody worked hard I   worked as a team player and would have   loved to have seen this past but again I   think you know I was very clear because   I think it wasn't a speech I've made a   very few who I didn't mention that   perhaps the best thing that could happen   is exactly what happened today because   we'll end up with a truly great health   care bill in the future after this mess   known as Obamacare explode so   want to thank everybody for being here   it will go very smoothly I really   believe I think this is something that   certainly was an interesting period of   time we all learned a lot we learned a   lot about loyalty we learned a lot about   the vote getting process we learned a   lot about some very arcane rules in   obviously both the Senate and in the   house so it's been certainly for me it's   been a very interesting experience but   in the end I think it's going to be an   experience that leads to an even better   health care plan so thank you all very   much and I'll see you soon thank you now   your intention to go for tax reform or   what's next on your priority would be   going right now for tax reform which we   could have done earlier but this really   would have worked out better if we could   have had some Democrats support remember   this we had no democrat support so now   we're going to go for tax reform which   I've always liked in speaker Ryan's   leadership and his girl you get things   done yes I am I like speaker Ryan he   worked very very hard a lot of different   groups he's got a lot of factions and   there's been a long history of liking   and disliking even within the Republican   Party long before I got here but I've   had a great relationship with the   Republican Party it seems that both   sides like Trump them that's good and   you see that I guess more clearly than   anybody but we've had a grab not going   to speak badly about anybody within the   party but certainly there's a big   history I think Paul really worked hard   and I would say that we will probably   start going very very strongly for the   big tax cuts and tax reform that will be   next   why is she going to happen there's not   much you can do about it it's going to   pass things that can happen to Obamacare   there's not much you can do to help it   I've been saying that for a year and a   half and said look eventually it's not   sustainable the insurance companies are   leaving you know that they're leaving   one by one as quick as you can leave and   you have states in some cases soon will   not be covered so there's no way out of   that but the one thing that was   happening as we got closer and closer   everybody was talking about how   wonderful it was and now it will go back   to real life people will see how bad it   is that it's getting much worse you know   I said the other day when President   Obama left 17 he knew he was into the   pier 17 s going to be a very very bad   year for Obamacare very very bad you can   have explosive premium increases and you   need here for Obamacare very very bad   you can have explosive premium increases   and your deductibles is so high people   don't even get to use it so they'll go   with that for a little while and I   honestly believe I know some of the   Democrats and they're good people I   honestly believe the Democrats will come   to us and say look let's get together   and get a great health care bill or a   plan that's really great for the people   of our country and I think that's going   to happen we have to go in the house   without any Democratic support why do   you think you weren't able to craft a   deal among the reporting party well we   were very close we were just probably   anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short could   have even been closer than that you'll   never know because you never know how   they vote but in the end I think we   would have been ten boats may be closer   and it's very hard to get almost a   hundred percent you know you're talking   about a very very large number of votes   among any group and we were very close   to doing it but when you get no votes   from the other side meaning the   Democrats it's really a difficult   situation   right now no I think we have to learn   Obamacare go its way for a little while   and we'll see how things go I'd love to   see it do well but I can't ever it again   it's not a question of gee I hope it   says well I would love it to do well I   want great health care for the people of   the station but it can't do well it's   imploding and should will explode and   it's not going to be pretty so the   Democrats don't want to see that so   they're going to reach out when they're   ready and whatever they're ready we're   ready betrayed by the house freedom   caucus at all please see the most   difficult i'm not actually they're   friends of mine i'm disappointed because   we could have had it so i'm disappointed   I'm a little surprised to be honest with   you we really had it it was pretty much   there within grasp but I'll tell you   what's going to come out of this is a   better bill I really believe a better   bill because there were things in this   bill I didn't particularly that and I   think it's a better bill you know both   parties can get together and do real   health care that's the best thing   Obamacare was rammed down everyone's   throat one hundred percent Democrat and   I think having bipartisan would be a big   big improvement so no I think that this   is going to end up being a very good   thing I'm disappointed with their   friends of mine and you know they got   all those are very hard time to them in   a very hard vote but they're very good   people   what specifically Hartman well I think   we can have things that I would have   liked more and if we had bipartisan I   really think we could have a health care   bill that would be the ultimate and I   think the Democrats know that also and   someday and they're not too distant   future that'll happen and I never said I   guess I'm here what 64 days I never said   repeal and replace Obamacare you've all   heard my speeches I never said repeal it   and replace it with in 64 days and a   long time but I want to have a great   health care bill and plan and we will it   will happen and it won't be in the very   distant future I really believe there   will be some Democrats support and that   will happen at it will be an even better   bill I think this was a very good bill I   think it will be even better the next   time around and I don't think that's   going to be in too long i heard that any   specific we want to see change going   from this bill cool i mean i don't want   to speak about specifics but there are   things i could have I would have liked   even more but I thought overall this was   a very very good bill and I thought tom   price dr. time person who really is   amazing on health care and his knowledge   I thought he did a fantastic job same   with Mike Pence I think these two guys   they work so hard and really did a   fantastic job thank you very much thank   you   thank you guys how I did you   thank you sir hey

President of   the United States and the Prime Minister   of Japan thank you very much   Prime Minister Abe a on behalf of the   American people I welcome you to the   very famous White House you honor us   with your presence this is one of our   earliest visits from a foreign leader   and I am truly glad that it could be   from such an important and steadfast   ally the bond between our two nations   and the friendship between our two   peoples runs very very deep this   administration is committed to bringing   those ties even closer we are committed   to the security of Japan and all areas   under its administrative control and to   further strengthening our very crucial   alliance the us-japan Alliance is the   cornerstone of peace and stability in   the Pacific region it is important that   both Japan and the United States   continue to invest very heavily in the   alliance to build up our defense and our   defensive capabilities which under a   mutual leadership will become stronger   and stronger and as time goes by   ultimately they will be impenetrable we   faced numerous challenges and bilateral   cooperation is essential our country is   committed to being an active and fully   engaged partner we will work together to   promote our shared interests   of which we have many in the region   including freedom from navigation and of   navigation and defending against the   North Korean missile and nuclear threat   both of which I consider a very very   high priority on the economy we will   seek a trading relationship that is free   fair and reciprocal benefiting both of   our countries the vibrant exchange   between us is a true blessing Japan is a   proud nation with a rich history and   culture and the American people have   profound respect for your country and   its traditions I also want to take this   opportunity mr. prime minister to thank   you and the people of Japan for hosting   our armed forces working together our   two countries have the ability to bring   greater harmony stability and prosperity   to the Pacific region and beyond   improving countless lives in the process   we are committed to that goal highly   committed Prime Minister obey on behalf   of the United States of America I thank   you for being with us today we will soon   be traveling to the great state of   Florida where I know we will have a long   and very successful talk negotiations   and a very very productive weekend mr.   prime minister   this is the fourth time in six months   for me had to visit the United States   the last time was in Pearl Harbor Hawaii   at the end of last year   I am indeed sincerely grateful for the   always heartwarming welcome accorded to   me   by the American people I would also like   to express my sincere gratitude to   president Trump Oh Donald you must have   been very busy in this very important   period of a hundred days after your   inauguration and thank you very much for   inviting me over her to the White House   my name is Abbot but in the United   States some people mistakenly pronounce   my name is ape but that is not bad   because even in Japan   everybody knows the name of that great   president that farmer carpenter's son   can become a precedent and that fact 150   years ago surprised the Japanese who   were still under the Shogunate a rule   the Japanese opened their eyes to   democracy United States is the champion   of democracy   Donald president you are excellent   businessman but you have never been in   the Congress or being a governor you   have not experienced being in the public   office but you have fought the uphill   struggle and fight for more than a year   in the election campaign to become a new   president and this is the dynamism of   democracy I would like to celebrate and   congratulate Donald I've been sworn in   as the president the United States is a   country having the largest number of   chances opportunities in the world that   has always been the case right now as   well as going forward this will never   change   and that is the reason why automotive   industries and other Japanese the   businesses have built factories all over   the United States to engage in local   production here last year from Japan to   the United States there have been more   than 150 billion dollars of new   investment being made into the United   States and those Japanese businesses   have created large number of jobs but   the mutually beneficial economic   relations have been built by Japan in   the United States with President Trump /   are taking on the leadership I'm sure   they will be major scale infrastructure   investment will be made including the   fast speed train those of you who have   rode on the Japanese Shinkansen I'm sure   you would appreciate the speed the   comfort and safety with the latest   maglev technology from the Washington DC   to New York where Trump Tower exists   only one hour would it take if you ride   the maglev train from Washington DC here   to New York Japan with that are high   level of technical capability we will be   able to contribute to president Trump's   growth strategy there will be even more   new jobs being born in the United States   to further deepen the bilateral economic   relations between Deputy Prime Minister   a Seoul and vice president pence there   will be a cross-sectoral dialogue to be   held and we have agreed on this and   furthermore in asia-pacific where we see   dramatic growth to expand free trade and   investment this will be a big chance for   both Japan and the United States but of   course it must be done in a fair manner   never should a state-owned company   backed by state capital should not make   any economic intervention free ride on   intellectual property property should   not be condoned in asia-pacific region   with Japan in us taking on the   leadership to create free and fair   market based upon rules should be built   I and president Trump has confirmed on   our strong will to do so the cornerstone   of peace and prosperity in Asia Pacific   that that is the strong japan-us   alliance and this is an unwavering ties   between our two countries I am president   the Trump will work together to further   strengthen our alliance we have shared   this strong resolve as we see   increasingly difficult security   environment we have confirmed that the   us-japan security pact article 5 will be   applied a to think at the islands the   United States will strengthen its   presence in division and under the   banner of the proactive contribution to   peace Japan and will play a greater role   at the same time we will maintain the   deterrence and also her to proceed on   reducing the impact we had a will fought   through on her that the realignment of   the US forces in Japan and hinako's   relocation to hinako of the MCAS Futenma   is the only solution and Japan and us   will continue to her to work closely on   this on North Korea we heard the word   the strongly ally demand North Korea to   abandoned nuclear and ballistic missile   the program and not how to make any more   provocations and we have a completely   agreed on the importance of the early   solution for the abduction issue in East   China Sea South China Sea and Indian   Ocean everywhere we need her to maintain   her the freedom of navigation and rule   of law in such international order the   master had to be maintained Japan in   United States have confirmed that we   will strongly a protest any use of force   as well as radical version or to change   the status pole I ended the president   will address not only bilateral but   regional hood issues and we have had a   very frank exchange of views on the   peace and prosperity of the world that   we should contribute for any form over   terrorism should be strongly condemned   and we had a word to cooperate but in   our fight against terrorism Japan had a   will of course exercise Orca metric   troll in this regard and furthermore or   the regional conflict there are the   refugees of poverty and infectious   diseases there are many hit the   challenges faced by the world which will   be a serious issue that to threaten the   peace and stability for Japan as well as   the United States but Japan in the   United States and the international   community must work hand in hand in   order solve these questions of course   there are disagreements but we should   not close down but they had a dialogue   just by pointing to the differences and   ignoring the common interests and common   goals we need to have a dialogue because   there are disagreements what do we   mostly desire what is most desired by   those who are challenging the existing   international order is that to just   focus on differences we should not close   a deal dialogue Japan and I have worked   for four years and I have consistently   fought through her on   our foreign policy now whatever the   challenge and difficulty ahead of us I   and Trump are President Trump I will   continue our dialogue are to seek shared   solutions and after lunch said I am   looking forward at for weekend in   Florida with Donald we will play golf   together my scores in golf will is not   up to the level of Donald at all but my   policy is never up never in always   aiming for worthy the cup never had to   to just the goal with the short cuts and   short the chops that those are the words   never found in my dictionary but in a   relaxed atmosphere I hope to take time   to discuss with Donald on the future of   the world future of the region and   future of Japan in United States thank   you much   we'll take a few questions unless you   don't want to ask any questions if   that's possible   maybe we'll start where is a Daniel   halper New York Post Daniel   I'm curious about yesterday's ruling in   the Ninth Circuit Court has it caused   you to rethink your use of executive   power and how will you respond and will   you sign new executive orders and   perhaps a new travel ban and mr. prime   minister I'm curious about your reaction   to America's withdrawal from the   trans-pacific partnership the TPP do you   think that that's weaken America's put a   position in Asia and how do you think   had you envisioned it any sort of trade   deal with the president working out well   your question was unrelated to what   we're here for today but I'll answer it   we are going to keep our country safe we   are going to do whatever is necessary to   keep our country safe and we had a   decision which we think will be very   successful with it shouldn't have taken   this much time because safety is a   primary reason one of the reasons I'm   standing here today the security of our   country the voters felt that I would   give it the best security so we'll be   doing something very rapidly having to   do with additional security for our   country you'll be seeing that sometime   next week   in addition we will continue to go   through the court process and ultimately   I have no doubt that we'll win that   particular case   [Music]   now in the world we are also facing her   we had issues of refugees and terrorism   we need to work closely together on   these global issues Japan they have   always played our own role but going   forward or we would continue to work   with the international community to   execute a responsibility in a   commensurate manner and each of our   country has immigration control the   scheme as well as policy on immigration   as well as refugees these are to do with   domestic affairs of that country so I   would refrain from making any comments   okay a blake Burman Fox Blake Burman   [Music]   Thank You mr. president I'd like to pick   up where where Daniel left off if you   don't mind you said earlier this week   and I'm quoting for you said I've   learned a lot in the last two weeks   and terrorism is a far greater threat   and the people of our country understand   but we're going to take care of it based   off of what you have learned and now   knowing that your executive order is at   least temporarily on hold do you still   feel as confident now as you have been   at any point that you and the   administration will be able to protect   the homeland and mr. prime minister   thank you I would just like to pick off   again on what Daniel had asked about TPP   do you feel it's a mistake that the   United States has at least signaled its   intention to withdraw from the deal   thank you both I feel totally confident   that we will have tremendous security   for the people of the United States we   will be extreme vetting which is a term   that I developed early in my campaign   because I saw what was happening and   while I've been president which is just   for a very short period of time I've   learned tremendous things that you could   only learn frankly if you were in a   certain position namely president and   there are tremendous threats to our   country we will not allow that to happen   I can tell you that right now we will   not allow that to happen so we'll be   going forward and we'll be doing things   to continue to make our country safe it   will happen rapidly and we will not   allow people into our country who are   looking to do harm to our people we will   allow lots of people into our country   that will love our people and do good   for our country it's always going to be   that way at least during my   administration I can tell you that   ana ho Oh TPP into tava on TPP of course   we are fully aware of president Trump's   a decision on economic issues we will be   discussing at the working lunch to   follow as for Japan in United States a   trade and investment as well as economic   relations how can we develop and grow   our relationship as I have already   mentioned a Deputy Prime Minister also   and vice president pence I will create a   new framework for dialogue and I am   quite optimistic that had the good   results will be seen from the dialog now   a foe wholly free and fair common set of   rules to be created for the free trade   regime in via the region and that was   the purpose of TPP and that the   importance have not changed I'm myself   believe that Susanna's NHK know her too   much man   thank you my name is Hara from NHK I   have a question to Prime Minister other   now for the automotive market in Japan   as well as foreign exchange of for Japan   in the prior remark so there have been   discrepancy in your positions so at the   summit meeting what were the discussions   and were you able to narrow down the gap   and president the Trump had said that he   will make United States a great a   country what there is is meant by the   great country and prime minister what do   you mean when you say United States is a   great ally for you now with the birth of   the Trump administration the new Genesis   will have to be built between Japan and   us in economy lations in order to put   forward such strong message I have   proposed to launch a new framework a for   Economic dialogue and we were able to   agree on this as for   sectoral discussions we will be having a   discussion at the art working lunch   in any case between President Trump and   I myself on Japan and US economic   relations we will we have already agreed   that we will have vice president Pence   and deputy prime minister also or to   discuss fully on her the economic   relations between our two countries and   we are looking forward for the good   results so to ensue from the debate a   between had a V at experts as for the   foreign exchange or we will have   Secretary Treasury and Minister of   Finance I will continue in the close   communication for the United States to   become a great nation the various roles   played by the United States and the   responsibility to go with it the hold   over is faced with increasing   uncertainty that United States will   become a great America and become a   great and strong ally would be good for   Japan and for Japan and u.s. alliance to   be further strengthened would be good   not only for two nations but also   contribute to the peace and prosperity   of Asia Pacific and the United States to   become even greater we will welcome that   thank you I will say that and you've   seen it ever since I won the election   and became president-elect I've been   telling companies car companies and   other companies many companies come back   into the United States and they've been   coming back in and big announcements are   going to be made over the next short   period of time some of you already know   what those announcements are we've lost   a lot of our factories a lot of our   plants and those factories of those   plants will be coming back and jobs will   be coming back to Michigan and Ohio and   Pennsylvania and North Carolina and so   many other places where we've   lost so many jobs and those are the   people that were so good to me and now   I'm being good to them so we've had a   tremendous number of announcements we've   had Ford and General Motors and many   many others Intel yesterday made a major   announcement and they did that because   of what is happening with our tax   structure which is going along very well   and we'll be having some very big news   over the next short period of time but   we are a nation of tremendous potential   and the expression make America great   again I will tell you and I will add   very struggling with greater surety it   will be greater than ever before and I   just want to thank the Prime Minister   for a friendship you know we developed a   great friendship when we met in New York   City at Trump Tower we spoke for a long   long period of time and when I greeted   him today at the car I was saying I   shook hands but I grabbed him and hugged   him because that's the way we feel we   have a very very good bond very very   good chemistry I'll let you know if it   changes but I don't think it will so I   just want to I just want to thank the   Prime Minister for being here we're   going to be meeting your wife in a very   short period of time and I look very   much forward to that and I want to thank   everybody in the room we're going to   have a tremendous relationship long term   relationship of mutual benefit with   Japan thank you all very much   thank you thank you mr. prime minister   yes certainly   okay go ahead on here those I must thank   you very much from Sankey Edison boom my   name is Takeda I have a question to   president Trump Obama administration   under the rebalance to hood Asia I have   emphasized Asia but China is taking   hardline stance in South China Sea as   well as China Sea and North Korea has   went on her own the missiles and nuclear   development   so some countries in Asia are concerned   over commitment of United States in Asia   so against this backdrop as was   mentioned earlier for the trump   administration of all the situations in   Asia how would you respond to the   increasing difficulty here and the   president that you have repeatedly   stated about China taking on the   currency foreign exchange policies which   are not the good for the United States   do you think that eventually it will   change in the future I had a very very   good conversation as most of you know   yesterday with the president of China it   was a very very warm conversation I   think we are on the process of getting   along very well and I think that will   also be very much of a benefit to Japan   so we had a very very good talk last   night and discussed a lot of subject it   was a long talk and we are working on   that as we speak we have conversations   with various representatives of China I   believe that that will all work out very   well for everybody   China Japan the United States and   everybody in the region as far as the   currency devaluations I've been   complaining about that for a long time   and I believe that we will all   eventually and probably very much sooner   than a lot of people understand or think   we will be all at a level playing field   because that's the only way it's fair   that's the only way that you can fairly   compete in trade and other things and we   will be on that field and we will all be   working very hard to do great for our   country but it has to be fair and we   will make it fair I think the United   States is going to be an even bigger   player than it is right now by a lot   when it comes to trade a lot of that   will have to do with our tax policy   which you'll be seeing in the   not-too-distant future we'll have an   incentive-based policy much more so that   we have right now right now we don't   even know nobody knows what policy we   have but we're going to have a very much   incentive-based policy we're working   with Congress working with Paul Ryan   working with Mitch McConnell and I think   people are going to be very very   impressed we're also working very much   and this has a lot to do with business   on health care where we can get great   health care for our country at a much   reduced price both to the people   receiving the health care and to our   country because our country is paying so   much and Obama care as you know is a   total and complete disaster so we're   going to end up with tremendous health   care at a lower price and I think people   are going to be extremely happy   difficult process but once we get going   and you know tom price was just approved   a few hours ago so we finally have our   secretary and now we get down to the   final strokes again I want to thank   everybody for being here I want to thank   mr. prime minister what an honor what a   great honor it is and let's go to   Florida   [Applause]   [Music]

Donald Trump and   the prime minister of the State of   Israel intervention Thank You President   Trump Donald Sarah and I are absolutely   delighted to welcome you and Melania to   the Prime Minister's residence in   Jerusalem the eternal capital of the   Jewish people the united capital of the   Jewish state we've known each other for   many years and it's always good to see   you but it's also wonderful to see the   blossoming friendship between our two   beautiful lives Sarah and Melania you're   so welcome here and we're so pleased to   see you we're honored to have you in our   home you've been today mr. president to   the western wall one of the holiest   sites of Judaism you've been to the   Church of the Holy Sepulchre one of the   holiest sites of Christianity we protect   the Christian sites as no one else does   anywhere in this region we protect   Christian sites Muslim sites obviously   Jewish sites were committed to the   freedom of all faiths and to the rights   of all mr. president I appreciate the   fact that you went to the Western Wall   and you're the first acting president   who's done that the people of Israel   applaud you for it   we had a terrific discussion today and   when I say terrific it encompasses   everything we could talk about   deregulation we can talk about economics   I think we quote each other we   understand each other and so much of the   things that we wish to accomplish for   both our countries but I want to thank   you especially today for your deep   commitment to Israel's security its   well-being and its future I have no   doubt that as we work together you and I   the alliance between our countries will   grow ever stronger I want you to know   how much we appreciate the change in   American policy on Iran which you   enunciated so clearly just an hour ago I   want you to know how much we appreciate   your bold decision to act against the   use of chemical weapons in Syria and I   want to tell you also how much we   appreciate the reassertion of American   leadership in the Middle East I look   forward to working closely with you to   confront the dangers we face together in   this volume violent and volatile Middle   East I believe that together we could   roll back Iran's march of aggression and   terror in this region and we can thwart   Iran's unbridled ambition to become a   nuclear weapons state I also look   forward to working closely with you to   advance peace in our region because you   have noted so succinctly that common   dangers are turning former enemies into   partners and that's where we see   something new and potentially something   very promising it won't be simple but   for the first time in many years and mr.   president for the first time in my   lifetime I see a real hope for change   the Arab leaders who you met yesterday   could help change the atmosphere and   they could help create the conditions   for a realistic peace these are all   great signs on your historic visits   it's a visit that I think has echoed   down the ages because the great Abraham   Lincoln is reported to have said that   there was no city on earth he's so much   desire to see as Jerusalem well mr.   president Donald there's no city on   earth where you are more welcome than   right here with us in Jerusalem welcome   to Jerusalem welcome to Israel thank you   very much and it's a great honor to be   with my good friend Prime Minister   Netanyahu and of course Sarah thank you   and also thank you for that beautiful   tour   Melania is still talking about it thank   you very much you honored me and Melania   by being one of the first world leaders   to visit the White House as you know and   we had a very good and sound discussion   and now you honor us again by welcoming   us to your home on my first trip abroad   as the president of the United States   this is a land filled with beauty Wonder   and the Spirit of God I've been amazed   by the glorious and beautiful monuments   and holy sites and the generosity of   your incredible people because it's all   about the people I was deeply moved by   my visit today to the Western Wall words   failed to capture the experience it will   leave an impression on me forever today   we reaffirm the unbreakable bond of   friendship between Israel and the United   States   a friendship built on our shared love of   freedom our shared belief in human   dignity and our shared hope for Israel   at lasting peace we want Israel to have   peace but we are more than friends we   are great allies we have so many   opportunities in front of us but we must   seize them together we must take   advantage of the situation and there are   many many things that can happen now   that would never have been able to   happen before and we understand that   very well that includes advancing   prosperity defeating the evils of   terrorism and facing the threat of an   Iranian regime that is threatening the   region and causing so much violence and   suffering during my travels I have seen   many hopeful signs that lead me to   believe that we can truly achieve a more   peaceful future for this region and for   people of all faiths and all beliefs and   frankly all over the world in my visit   to Saudi Arabia I met with many leaders   of the Arab and Muslim world including   King Salman who treated us so   beautifully and really wants to see   great things happen for the world   he really does I got to know him well   and he really does these leaders voice   concerns we all share about Isis   about Iran's rising ambitions and   rolling back its gains and about the   Menace of extremism that has spread   through too many parts of the Muslim   world I'm encouraged that they pledged   cooperation to confront terrorism   and the hateful ideology that drives it   so hard   America welcomes the action and support   of any nation willing to do the hard but   vital work in eradicating the violent   ideologies that have caused so much   needless bloodshed and killing here and   all over the world we are willing to   work together I believe that a new level   of partnership is possible and will   happen one that will bring greater   safety to this region greater security   to the United States and greater   prosperity to the world this includes a   renewed effort at peace between the   Israelis and the Palestinians and I   thank the Prime Minister for his   commitment to pursuing the peace process   working very hard at it   it's not easy I've heard it's one of the   toughest deals of all but I have a   feeling that we're going to get there   eventually   I hope I'm certain we will have very   productive discussions and we're going   to have very productive discussions in   my opinion with the leaders of other   nations also and I feel strongly about   that because there's a lot of love out   there and people from all nations even   nations that you would be surprised to   hear they want to stop the killing   they've had enough America stands ready   to assist in every way we can our deep   and lasting friendship will only grow   deeper and stronger as we work together   in the days ahead I thank you again for   hosting us in this beautiful and ancient   land truly it's a land of wonders and   it's my honor to be here with you Sarah   thank you Bibi thank you   I appreciate it very much great honor   thank you thank you what would you like   a sister hey   thank you very much thank you thank you   very much factors of those famous doping

 very good James ah but really you're the   backbone of America with the talent in   this room we can build any city at any   time and we can build it better than   anyone   [Applause]   but we're going to do even better than   that together we are going to rebuild   our nation you're the keepers of the   great trades and traditions that built   our country from the New York skyline to   the Golden Gate Bridge you represent the   workers whose hand skills and dreams   will build the great landmarks of our   future every day your members live out   what I call the American creed they're   on the job before dawn and after dusk   and they never quit until that job is   done you know that true true we saw this   grit on display when the construction   trades helped rebuild New York City   after 911   I was a terrible time we were all there   was a terrible time in this country's   history worst attack in the history of   our country worse than Pearl Harbor   Pearl Harbor they were attacking   military here they were attacking   civilians worst attack and I saw what   happened within a very short period of   time we were back rebuilding and we   build you did and I really congratulate   it took a lot of courage and a lot of   strength thank you the fact is you take   pride in every part of your work every   joist bolt and rivet you're not only   builders but your artisans very talented   people a lot of people don't understand   you're very talented people enriching   our cities and landscapes with works of   great beauty and just as you take pride   in your work our nation takes great   great pride in you believe me and it's   time that we give you the level playing   field you deserve   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   thank you thank you Washington and Wall   Street have done very very well for   themselves now it's your turn and you're   going to be also sharing the wealth and   [Applause]   you know for many years we've been taken   advantage of by other countries all over   the world they took advantage of us we   had leaders that didn't have a clue or   worse that's not going to happen anymore   folks it's not going to happen anymore   you see what's going on right now in   fact the trade deficit went way down   just announced before I got on stage and   i will tell you we're going to have a   whole different set of values when it   comes to representing our country that i   can tell you right now this election was   all about returning power to the people   I've spent my life working side by side   with American builders and now you have   a builder as your president   one of my first acts as president was to   stop one of the great sellouts of the   American worker I immediately withdrew   the United States from the disaster this   would have been a disaster this would   have been another NAFTA which by the way   is a disaster I took you out of the   trans-pacific partnership thank you that   one wasn't even close you know it I know   it everybody knows it next I cleared the   way for the construction of the Keystone   XL and Dakota access pipeline   [Applause]   and it's looking like that's going to   have about 42000 jobs involved those   two jobs at some number of great people   that's a big big beautiful a lot of   people and Sean actually in a whole   group joined me in the Oval Office when   we approved the Keystone permit and I   joke I joke that day I said can you   imagine the head of this big Canadian   company in this case they build   pipelines and they failed didn't work   they paid millions and millions and   hundreds of millions of dollars to   consultants and lawyers and they failed   and it was over and then one day Trump   wins and a few days later they get a   knock on the door sir the Keystone   pipeline was just approved can you   imagine I want to see the expression on   his face and he's a nice guy actually   they came to the office because you know   I did say you have to use American steel   you have to fabricate it here now they   had already bought sixty seventy percent   of it so you can't be too wild right but   I was signing the order I said when they   buy this deal I didn't like the answer I   said who fabricated the steel I didn't   like the answer i said from now on we're   going to put a clause got to be made in   America we want Americans still made   animal right another hundred percent   and you'll be hearing more about this in   the very near future but as time goes by   let's say over the next seven and   three-quarters years meaning eight years   we believe in two simple rules by   American and hire American that's what's   going to be and that's not just a slogan   it's a promise believe me that's a   promise the era of economics Orenda has   come to an end to come to an end we have   surrendered as a country to outside   interest the era of economic victory for   our country has just begun you will see   no longer will we listen to those failed   consultants who've made one wrong   prediction after another delivering   nothing but soaring trade deficits and a   big fat shrinking workforce for decades   now we've watched as our factories of   shuddered almost seventy thousand   factories our jobs have been stolen and   blue-collar wages have declined we've   seen the economic pain inflicted on our   fellow Americans and Pittsburgh and   Detroit and Baltimore we didn't just   offshore our jobs we offshored a big big   part of the American dream we enriched   foreign countries at the expense of our   own country the great united states of   america but those days are over   I'm not and I don't want to be the   president of the world I'm the president   of the united states and from now on   it's going to be America first we're   going to bring back our jobs and yes   we're going to bring back the American   dream as I travel the nation I heard the   pleas of the Forgotten men and women of   our country the people who work hard and   play by the rules but who don't have a   voice together we are their voice and   they will never ever be forgotten again   that i can tell you i don't know if you   saw but if you watch the democrats now   the anger the anger and hatred and   they're trying to figure out where did   all these people came that voted for   Donald Trump remember they said because   the electoral college is very very hard   they say almost impossible for a   Republican to win the odds are stacked   and they would say there's no way to 270   you need 270 there's no way to 27 I   heard that so much for a year I kept   saying maybe I shouldn't be running you   know Sean I said maybe I shouldn't run   because there's no way the people are   telling me the same people that say all   of the bad stuff they're saying there's   no way to 270 well but there was a way   to 306 but wasn't that an exciting one   you know kind of places that nobody   entered Donald Trump has won the state   of Michigan they go what Donald Trump   has won the state of Wisconsin they came   out of the blue and we didn't even need   them and we love those two states   because we won the state of Pennsylvania   and we won Ohio and Iowa in North   Carolina and South Carolina in Florida   and so many others we ran the coast and   if you don't run it you can't win huge   disadvantage the electoral college is   very very tough   they say almost impossible for   Republican to win but I had the support   of i would say i would say almost   everybody in this room we had tremendous   we had tremendous support though we did   we had tremendous secure we had   tremendous support and i'll tell you we   really had the support of the workers we   had tremendous support of the workers   what would you like to make a change   hooks would you like to make a change   because if anybody wants to make a   change you won't be having so many jobs   that i can tell you your jobs will be be   a whole different story because in the   last decade you lost over 750   construction seven think of this 750000   construction jobs real wages in the   construction sector have fallen more   than fifteen percent since the 1970s we   ranked 39th in the world for   construction permitting and approvals   for infrastructure projects can take up   to 10 years since taking office I've   signed one action after another to   eliminate job-killing regulations that   stand in a way I had a chart is that   yard around here someplace did you have   that I have to show this chart you   because it's amazing actually   this is if you want to build a highway   in the United States these are some of   the permits that you need it's a process   that can take way over ten years and it   just never happens then at the end of   the period they vote against it and   we're getting rid of many of these   regulations you have to go through 17   agencies many permits in each agency in   February alone we added almost 60000   new construction jobs country I ordered   expedited environmental reviews for   infrastructure environmental and energy   projects all across the country no   longer will you have to wait year after   year for approvals that never come I   also took historic action to lift the   restrictions on American energy   production and to put our miners who   have been treated horribly back to work   consumer confidence a great people   consumer confidence is at the highest   level in more than a decade you've seen   all of the charts all of the studies the   National Association of Manufacturers   just the other day reported the most   optimism in the entire history of its   survey which is a old survey 93% of   manufacturers are optimistic about the   future it's almost twenty-seven percent   lower than that just a few months ago   the home builders confidence index is at   its highest level in 12 years and now in   breaking news it was just reported today   the monthly US trade deficit declined by   ten percent for a reason not by accident   believe me it's for a reason we're also   going to protect your jobs by protecting   our borders my administration is just a   matter of weeks and literally short   period of time has brought record   reductions to illegal   immigration record reductions down 61   percent since inauguration general Kelly   is doing a fantastic job and will crack   down on visa abuses that undermine the   American worker and we're doing that   right now these are so many other   achievements have defined our first ten   weeks in office we've done so much for   the worker than so much for the military   we've done so much for the police   officers or men in blue and women in   blue who are not treated fairly we're   fighting for workers of all backgrounds   and from all walks of life but to   achieve true progress we must remember   our legacy we're the nation that built   the tallest skyscrapers on what was once   the Hudson River and put neon lights of   Las Vegas in the middle of the desert   but if government continues to punish   America's builders then we will not be   that nation any longer I'm calling on   all Americans Democrat Republican   independent to come together and take   part in the great rebuilding of our   country that is why   that is why in my address to Congress I   called on lawmakers to pass legislation   that produces a 1 trillion dollar   investment in the infrastructure of our   country and we need it with your help we   can rebuild our country's bridges   airports seaports and water systems we   will streamline the process to get   approvals quickly so that long delayed   projects can finally move ahead and with   lower taxes on America's middle class   and businesses we will see a new surge   of economic growth and development all   of you have come to the nation's capital   to call members of the House and Senate   to action you've also called your   president to action when you see them   you can tell Congress that America's   building trades and its president are   very much united   together we are ready to break new   ground we will build in the spirit of   one of the great projects in our   nation's history an enduring symbol of   American strength the Empire State   Building was forged in the Great   Depression and provided jobs for more   than 3000 workers we've all seen the   pictures rugged workers perched dozens   and dozens of stories up in the air   workers like these moved almost 60000   tons of steel install 200000 cubic feet   of stone and laid 10 million bricks to   build that American icon and they did   the job in a record time 13 months hard   to believe think of that boy state   building built in 13 months during the   Depression nowadays you couldn't even   get a building permit or approval in   that amount of time when the workers had   secured the last piece of steel and that   amazing and beautiful structure they   mark the moment as we still do today   with what is called a topping out   ceremony 1050 feet above the streets of   New York City they hoisted a beautiful   and great American flag   [Applause]   they did a good job they did a good   those iron workers you better believe it   it was an American flag that represented   American projects the big bold and   daring dream of one man and then one   city and then finally one people that   banner marked our nation's proud climb   to the top of the world our people   endured through the hardships of   depression and the battles of World War   two and they emerge from these trials   stronger and more United than ever   before now we must again someone that   same national greatness to meet the   challenges of our time only miles from   the halls of Congress and the newsroom's   of Washington you will find once   thriving cities marred by empty lots and   once booming industrial towns that have   become rusted and are in total disrepair   standing before me today in this very   Hall are the men and women who have   given the chance can transform these   communities you are the citizens who can   rebuild our cities revive our industries   and renew our beloved country and i know   you will stop at nothing to get the job   done   [Applause]   for the rest of their lives everyone who   worked on the Empire State Building knew   when they looked up at that great New   York skyline that they had lifted the   Stars and Stripes atop the tallest   flagpole on earth and that somewhere   high above the city streets their place   in history was carved into beams of   steel in the future when we become the   trials and we are trials of our times we   too will emerge stronger and more United   than ever before it's happening you   watch when we rise above the cynics and   critics who live only to defend the   status quo and to defend themselves from   failure then we too will construct a   lasting monument to national greatness   in this future our nation's workers and   craftsmen will look way out at the vast   open landscape and they will build new   bridges and new schools and new   landmarks and they will proudly raise up   for all to see a bright and beautiful   American flag and when we see that flag   we will remember that we all share one   American home one American Heart and one   American destiny may God bless our   nation's builders may God bless our   nation's workers and may God bless the   United States of America thank you very   much   you
