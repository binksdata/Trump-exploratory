[Applause]   we're having to mostly big groups thank   you everybody thank you in 12 days we   are going to win Ohio and we are going   to win back the White House believing a   brand-new poll just came out Remington   research has us up four points in Ohio   [Applause]   early voting is underway so make sure   you get out and vote right this is   amazing all no matter where we go we   have these massive crowds we just left   one that was eleven thousand were just   it's been amazing the receptivity   there's never been anything like this in   this country but you have to get out and   vote because otherwise always now we're   going to win we're going to win big I   think we're going to win a lot bigger   than people even understand you know hot   pitta we're tired of stupidity and we're   tired of incompetents and we're going to   run it properly and that's what we want   we want to we want to make America great   again folks very simple seventy-five   percent of the american people think our   country is on the wrong track who are   the other 25 just that accurate who are   the 25-percent we're going to fix it and   we're going to get our country back on   the right track real change begins with   immediately repealing and replacing   Obamacare what a mess   it never worked from day one it was   never destined to work there was no way   it was ever going to work and I said   before they voted i said that's never   going to work it has just been announced   that Americans are going to experience a   massive double digit hiking Obama care   premiums including a one hundred and   sixteen percent premium hike in the   great state of Arizona thank you that   don't worry you're not going to be so   far behind don't worry it's a mess it's   a mess it's going up at numbers like you   wouldn't believe just so you understand   Hillary Clinton is going to double down   double up she wants that thing she's   going to spend so much money but you're   going to spend more money you're right   even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is   the craziest thing in the world quote   craziest thing in the world where people   wind up with their premiums doubled and   their coverage cut in half job-killing   Obamacare is just one more way the   system is rigged Hillary Clinton wants   to double down an Obamacare destroying   American health care forever and   destroying businesses forever because   you see what it's doing to business is   small and big just this year crooked   Hillary declare that Obamacare is one of   the greatest accomplishments of   President Obama of the Democratic Party   and of our country   can you imagine I'm just standing here   say could you believe this can you   imagine if that's one of your greatest   accomplishments as president that is and   it's a disaster and by the way we're   going to repeal it but it's gonna die of   its own weight it's not gonna can't make   it anyway the insurance companies are   all leaving they're fleeing here at Ohio   another five insurance companies are   dropping out of Obamacare you'll have   nobody to negotiate with just one maybe   and that's a tough negotiation that   means all the residents covered by plans   from these companies will be getting   cancellation notices very shortly i'm   sure you look forward to that it's a   catastrophic situation beyond   imagination repealing obamacare is one   of the single most important reasons we   must win on november eighth she wants to   keep   she wants to keep it we're gonna repeal   it we're going to have a really great   plan that's going to cost much less and   be much better real change also means   getting rid of the corruption in   Washington Hillary Clinton bleats and   deleted 33 thousand emails lied to   Congress under oath made 13 phones   disappear somewhere the hammer and then   told the FBI she couldn't remember 39   times   the Clinton crew gave more than six   hundred and seventy-five thousand   dollars to the wife of the deputy FBI   director overseeing the investigation   into Hillary's illegal so we need to   reopen the investigation   information came out today just a little   while ago that's more devastating than   anything you've seen so far WikiLeaks   more information but it pertains to what   they knew and it makes all of them   they're already liars but it confirms it   for the 75th time Hillary Clinton put   the office of Secretary of State up for   sale and if she got the chance she put   the Oval Office up for sale also i   proposed a contract with the american   voter that will end the corruption and   give the government back to the people   I want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment and you know I've been on   that side just so you understand life   was a lot easier on that side I didn't   have to do this but today i announced   june you're welcome yeah well   here well we had to do the right thing   the Washington establishment to hear and   heed the words I'm about to say if we   win on November a ok ok you ready when   we win   [Applause]   is a lot of good energy in Ohio that I   could you know I worked here very early   in my career like the earliest one of   the first jobs I've ever done I worked   in Cincinnati Anna was a great success   and it gave me that confidence you know   I had a success and it was confidence   and I love Ohio always have so when we   win we are going to Washington DC and we   are going to drain the swamp   you know that phrase started about a   week ago and I thought it was terrible I   didn't like it at all I said I don't   know I just don't like it and now it's   become one of the hottest phrases   anywhere in the world that I'm saying I   like it that's like did you ever see the   great singers Frank Sinatra some of his   greatest hits he didn't like him but at   the end he liked him very much I so what   happened with drain the swamp it's a   great phrase but it's true the people   like it that's much more important that   the court my contra is my plan to bring   back our jobs we're living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world so true Ohio has lost one in   four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a   deal signed by Bill Clinton and   supported strongly by crooked Hillary   remember   [Applause]   how is the one that said that at section   this guy's screaming at Slick Willy it's   true that's right supported strongly by   Slick Willy i think i'll make that   remember every time you see a clothes   factory and before I get into this is   it's too depressing is this the most fun   you'll ever have right being at a trump   rally we've got a trump rally there's   nothing but all right now let's get back   to the closed factories okay but every   time you see a close factor a wiped-out   community here in Ohio the Clintons were   really involved because NAFTA's been   such a disaster and he signed it new   mothers metal closed its factory in   Toledo and laid off 168 workers and   shipped their jobs to Mexico 2010 texty   leather corporation closed their Toledo   factory and laid off 160 workers and   move their jobs to China and Canada in   2009 honeywell auto lights factory   enforced area over the past 16 years is   laid off and moved at least 900 jobs to   Mexico employees at dixon ticonderoga   rawa whoo Dixon Ticonderoga rights at   the name who the hell cares their gun I   mean who cares maybe we'll get him back   so we try getting him back   [Applause]   see now with me they wouldn't be able to   leave because whatever the hell they   make when they go to Mexico and they   make their product and they want to send   it back over the border and they leave   us with clothes plants and unemployment   and Mexico gets to cash the employment   the factories everything what happens is   they make their product you want to send   it across I say don't thank you it's a   thirty-five percent tax to get your   product like thirty five percent tax and   you know it's going to happen by doing   early enough they're not leaving they're   not leaving they're not going to leave   and if they do leave we make a lot of   money as a country that's okay but   nobody's leaving thirty-five percent go   ahead leave we'll enjoy it very much   we've lost and I say this all the time   because it's hard to believe seventy   thousand factories I thought it was a   type of I thought it was 700 or 7,000   it's seventy thousand factories since   China entered the World Trade   Organization another bill and hillary   back disaster under my contract if a   company wants to fire their workers move   to mexico or other countries and ship   their products back into the United   States as I said we will put a   thirty-five percent tax or tariffs on   those products and they will not leave   not gonna leave now the politicians do   this some of them did some of them   probably don't because they don't have   any basic understanding of the way the   system works but a lot of them knew this   but they controlled by special interests   you know I'll have over a hundred   million dollars invested in this   campaign meaning oh you know if I don't   win I will I will consider that some of   these dishonest people back here and   they are among the world's most aside   they are disgusting they are among the   world's most dishonest people but   believe it or not some of them they said   this what we have all done together is   one of the great political phenomena   some Bill O'Reilly said this is the   single greatest political phenomena that   he's ever witness right right but i'll   tell you what i'll be in for over a   hundred million dollars and a lot of   work a lot of energy and they were   saying it doesn't matter what you've   done will go down in the record books   and history because you know let's face   it when we started with 70 people i   wasn't exactly favored to win right the   only people that thought i was going to   win were the people that knew me right I   have friends that went in place bets   they said anytime I can place a bet   three percent on Trump I what I have one   friend read a lot of money but but you   know what one by one they disappeared   and then we're down to one person who's   got low energy very low energy she goes   to sleep so look here's the story folks   here's the story who is more low energy   bill o'reilly just a spare just did Bill   O'Reilly on tonight he said who's more   low energy jeb bush or hillary clinton   he just asked me that way what's the   answer   o.o who's more low-energy item hey and   you know what I say does it matter Ohio   is it the center of American Motor   Vehicles and the industry is really   suffering in terms of production   according to the state development   almost seventy-five percent of all light   vehicles produced in North America made   in Ohio or within 500 miles of this   great state the auto industry and its   feeder industries account for over ten   percent of Ohio's economy 75 of Ohio's   88 counties have at least one automotive   industry business nearly 1 in 8 Ohio   residents are either directly or   indirectly employed by the oh no   industry Hillary Clinton supported and   lobbied for the South Korea trade   agreement you know that one that's been   another disaster on the promise of 75   thousand new jobs instead her trade deal   destroyed 100,000 jobs mostly in the   auto industry and believe me as you   stand here today your executives are   negotiating deals to move businesses out   of Ohio and into Mexico and other   countries because we have nobody to   protect our companies and really nobody   to protect our workers next you got me   you got me believe me I'll put that   Hilary wants the trans-pacific   partnership which will kill the rest of   our auto jobs and kill jobs generally   speaking in this country won't be here's   the good news it will never be as bad as   NAFTA you never thought I'd say that   NAFTA is the all-time King they'll never   be anything like it first of all it was   defective the day it was done you know   it's a different tax system this is a   vat tax system right oh look there's a   person clapping because only one person   understood it this whole audience right   you know what I'm saying it's a vat tax   system so before we even start if we go   in or they come out we're seventeen   percent behind their taxes almost   seventeen percent so we're 17 so it was   a defective agreement for many years and   nobody ever fixed it so they had this   huge advantage for many years because of   the tax systems I will stop   trans-pacific partnership and I will   bring the auto jobs back to America and   keep your remaining auto jobs in ohio   believe me nobody's leaving they may   leave for a different state don't get   angry at me but we got to keep them in   our country we love our country right we   will immediately begin renegotiating   NAFTA that disaster and if we don't get   the deal we want we will terminate NAFTA   and get a much better deal alright   believe me you know folks there's got to   be a two-way street right you know you   want some coming this way the problem is   it's a one-way highway right out as part   of our plan to bring back American jobs   we will lower taxes on our businesses   from thirty five percent down to fifteen   percent will go from the highest to   among the lowest   Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on   small businesses up to forty five   percent what a difference you know a lot   of difference this is and just think you   to myself right now we should just   cancel the election and just give it to   trump right what do we even have about   what are we having her policies are so   bad why do we have a big difference   Hillary also says she wants to put coal   miners out of work not gonna happen   stop producing shale energy in most   places and place a permanent moratorium   on energy development on federal lands   where vast coal and shell energy and   other forms of energy are located my   administration will unleash all sources   of American energy including shale oil   natural gas renewables and clean coal   and we're putting the miners back to   work we will put our miners back to work   and we will put our steel workers who   are under siege back to work   we will become a rich nation once again   a woman came up to me three months ago   she said mr. Trump I love you I'm going   to vote for you she said but you're   making a terrible mistake when you talk   about making our country rich again it   doesn't sound good i said to me it   sounds good what she explained and i   understand you know in this world are   politically correct you're going to be   rich again we're going to make a rich   country again we need to be a rich   country again if we're going to do what   we have to do in terms of infrastructure   which is a disaster you know we spent   six trillion dollars in the Middle East   we could have rebuilt our country twice   and we are now in far worse shape in the   Middle East then if our presidents just   went to the beach every day right or in   the case of Obama went golfing every day   instead of every other day right see the   problem is he went every other day so   therefore the day he stayed in the White   House was not good and what about this   what about a guy who's constantly   campaigning for crooked Hillary totally   does right that's all he does he   campaigns this guy ought to be in the   White House working on jobs working on   our military working on defeating Isis   what a what a terrible situation but to   be a rich country we also must be a safe   country Hillary Clinton unleashed Isis   on to the world the vacuum was created   and it spread into the United States   there are now 1,000 open Isis   investigations in the United States Isis   is on a campaign of genocide against   Christians in the Middle East or what   they call the nation of the cross that's   what they call the nation of the Cross   think of that think of that that's the   term they have for Christians and people   who said that over there let me see who   said it who's the guy   don't worry they're gonna be I'll tell   they are dreaming of having her win   Gavin notice she says we're going to   work on the tax code we're gonna work on   Isis we're going to work on this she's   been there for 30 years what you've been   doing right what's he been doing Isis is   dreaming Isis's dreaming of her becoming   president that I can tell you they're   crucifying drowning and beheading their   victims not since medieval times have we   seen what's happening have you ever   thought you see this they're throwing   people off buildings and hanging their   victims from meat hooks the New York   Post just published reports about Isis   crushing children to death and burning   adults allowed this is what we have this   is what has been unleashed now Hilary   wants massive immigration from the most   dangerous regions of the world where   Isis operates including a five hundred   and fifty percent increase in Syrian   refugees entering our country over and   above the thousands and thousands   already coming here under Obama   a trump administration is going to   suspend immigration from tara prone   regions and we will suspend the syrian   refugee program   and you know what we're working will   build safe zones in Syria will do things   will get the Gulf states to put in the   money because our country has no money   we are 20 trillion dollars doubled up   under Obama and yet our roads are no   good and our tunnels and our hospitals   and our bridges and our schools so we   owe all this money and you know i'd like   to say if we heard the money and we're a   tippy top shape right tippy top but   we're not in tippy top we're in terrible   shape pretty sad pretty sad let me say   this as clearly as I can if I'm elected   president I am going to keep radical   Islam   [Applause]   when I'm elected president   [Applause]   better get out and vote I'm going to   keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell   out of our country collision belly   Hillary also said she wants totally open   borders meaning you don't have a country   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and yes we will build a wall a   real one this will be a real wall and   Mexico will pay for the wall thousands   of Americans have been killed by illegal   immigrants and by the way the Border   Patrol agents and ice both endorsed me   in ghostly first time they've ever   endorsed a candidate for president right   here in Ohio 60 year old Margaret   customer was murdered in cold blood by   an illegal immigrant earlier that day   our killer shot another woman in the arm   while she was with her children in a   nearby park police encountered the man   more than three weeks before the crime   spree but federal authorities under   Obama refused to take him into custody   people that knew this thug were begging   were begging that he be incarcerated he   was so dangerous nothing was done then   there was the case of 90 year old Earl   Olander a Minnesota farmer who was   brutally beaten by illegal immigrants   that left to bleed to death in his own   house Earl's body was found with his   hands bound behind his back and duct   tape and blunt force injuries to his   head his killers had criminal records of   my lung but they did not meet the Obama   administration's priority for removal   then you had the recent case of 800   people tough ones who were going to be   deported you saw that three weeks ago   right they were going to be deported now   you know if they're going to be deported   for our from our country they got to be   trouble what happened is there was a   mistake made and instead of deporting   them congratulations everybody they   became United States citizens and it was   a mistake bed instead of 800 I've little   bad news for you instead of 800 it was   close to 1,800 people so they became so   I then said very strongly then undo the   era under the era and they said we can't   do that it would not be constitutional   can you believe this can you believe it   right I have a message for the cartels   the drug dealers and the gang members   when I win when when do you understand   [Applause]   your long reign of crime and terror will   come to a crashing end we will also   repeal the obama-clinton defense cuts   and rebuild our badly depleted military   where we have our greatest fear we will   rebuild our army which is the smallest   since world war two and maybe we need it   more than ever before almost ever before   we've had some other pretty bad times   too but we need we need strength peace   through strength threat new orders for   equipment for our troops will need to   come to places like lima ohio home of i   like lima better what do you like home   of the abrams tank is that the best tank   in the world is it is it the best and we   will change our foreign policy Hillary   Clinton's policies in Iraq and Syria in   Libya through the middle east into   turmoil now Hilary wants to start a   shooting war in Syria in conflict with a   nuclear-armed rust which could very well   lead to World War three and you see the   way she talks about Putin I mean no   wonder Putin doesn't like her and has no   respect for you know their nuclear arms   it's alright would be nice if we got   along we don't we don't but it would be   nice but how can he get along with her   how can he get along with her he's got   no respect for her number one and the   way she talks ridiculous I'll tell you   what honestly if we could have a good   relationship with Russia that would be a   good thing not a bad thing I mean I   to say hey good I don't know that that   will happen but it would be a good thing   one thing I'll figure it out real fast   you understand that right I'll figure it   out real fast total Americans I say it's   time for new leadership we have to have   the roof we cannot have another four   years of Barack Obama cannot just think   about what we can accomplish in the   first 100 days we're going to have the   biggest tax cut since Ronald ray we're   going to eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation provide school   choice and put an end to common core   bring your education we're going to   rebuild our military and take care of   our great great veterans they have not   been taken care we will support the   wonderful men and women of law   enforcement save the Second Amendment   which is under siege and appoint   justices to the United States Supreme   Court who will uphold and defend the   Constitution of the United States   Americans are tired of being told by   politicians that they have to defer   their dreams to another day but really   you and I know it's another decade or   many decades away it's like our politics   are caught in a total time loop we keep   collecting the same people over and over   again who keep making the same mistakes   and who keep offering the same old tired   excuses these career politicians keep   telling us that things can change that   we can't try new solutions not only try   the new solutions are common sense so   simple I mean keeping our jobs that's   going to work folks it let me tell you   it's amazing it's amazing that it's gone   this long but again the special interest   of donors they control the politicians   but I have a message for them the future   belongs to the dreamers not the cynics   and not the critics   I'm asking all Americans to join me in   dreaming big like we used to in this   country big and bold for our future I'm   going to fight for every America every   background in every stretch of this   nation I'm going to fight for every   mother who has lost her child to illegal   immigration or drugs or gang violence I   am going to fight for every community in   Ohio in Michigan in Pennsylvania and all   around this nation whose jobs have been   ripped out and shipped to other   countries because we have people that   are not capable of properly   representatives so sad so easy and so   said I'm going to fight for every   citizen who believes that government   should serve the people not the donors   and not the special and I'm going to   fight to bring us all together as   Americans we're living in a divided   country it's not going to be divided   we're going to love everybody like we   love the people in this world just   imagine what our country could   accomplish if we started working   together as one people under one God   saluting one American flag off the   problem we're going to bring back jobs   to the inner cities we're going to bring   proper education including school choice   and we're going to bring safety back   we're going to bring safety back you   can't walk out the streak you buy a loaf   of bread and you end up getting shot so   we're going to work very strongly with   the african-american community and   remember this the Democrats have been   talking about this for years fun I mean   50 80 90 100 unbroken we are going to   solve the educational problem the crime   problem and the jobs problem of the   inner cities   and a lot of people are going to be very   happy going

bhT3xq4mZkE~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161020~Full Speech: Donald Trump Rally in Delaware, Ohio (10/20/2016) Post Final Debate vs Hillary Clinton~16474.0~4.82547998428~548.0~25.0~   the fire marshal they have a lot of   people outside but they got a lot in so   I appreciate it thank you very much   thank you   in 19 days we are going to win the state   of Ohio and we are going to   No   and I worked in ohio and i love ohio i   can genuine early voting is underway so   make sure you mail in your ballot and   you have to do it quickly and in person   but in november eighth get there we're   going to do something that has never   been done before in this country ladies   and gentlemen I want to make a major   announcement today I would like to   promise and pledge to all of my voters   and supporters and to all of the people   of the united states that i will totally   accept the results of this great and   historic presidential election if i win   all right seriously the debate last   night was amazing and everybody said i   won including every single online poll   and some had it at 90 and close to   ninety percent so let's go the question   of voter fraud came up during the debate   we want fairness in the election this is   having nothing to do with me but   happening to do with the future of our   country we have to have fairness John   Podesta Hillary Clinton's campaign   chairman was quoted in WikiLeaks as   saying illegal immigrants could vote as   long as they have their drivers license   what I'm saying is don't be naive folks   don't be naive one of the big issues   that came up last night was the fact   that the Clinton campaign has paid   people to disrupt violently our rallies   and to incite absolute total bedlam   it's so bad so bad and you know I've had   occasions where we had rallies and it   was so incredibly violent I said what's   going on over here these were paid   people by the Clinton campaign and it   just came out and I give a lot of credit   to the people that brought this out   believe me this is criminal behavior   that violates centuries of tradition of   peaceful democratic elections a campaign   like Clinton's that will incite violence   is truly a campaign that will do   anything to win and the candidate like   crooked Hillary Clinton who will lie to   Congress lie to the FBI destroy 33,000   emails put her office up for sale and   put our confidential information in the   reach of our enemies is a candidate who   is truly capable of anything including   voter fraud in addition it was just   learned that Hillary Clinton was given   the exact questions to a previous debate   word for word by donna Brazile   who is now under tremendous pressure to   resign from the DNC as she should be she   should resign how can a woman do that   that is cheating at the highest level   but I ask you why shouldn't Hillary   Clinton resign from the race she was   given think of it she was given these   questions she used these questions   studied the questions got the perfect   answer for the questions and never say   that she did something that was totally   wrong and inappropriate hence the name   crooked Hillary   [Applause]   years ago there was a show called the   sixty-four-thousand-dollar question a   contestant got the questions in advance   and his life was ruined they found out   about it remember anybody remember his   name come on   vandoren very good you look younger than   that Charles Van Doren Charles Van Doren   was his name he got the questions and   his life was ruined but Hillary Hillary   Clinton got the quest they give it   forget donna Brazile she should resign   she looked like such a fool last night   on television trying to say well she   didn't know what was going on she had no   idea she said get me out of here she got   the questions she got the questions she   gave them to Hillary Clinton Hillary   Clinton didn't say I'd like to announce   that a mistake was made and I can't take   these question I mean look how many   questions are there right can you   imagine if I got the questions they   would call for the reestablishment of   the electric chair do you agree with it   but she got the questions and she didn't   report it she went out there knowing the   questions she didn't report it that is   very dishonest she's a very dishonest   person this is even bigger because we   are going for the presidency of the   United States so this is very important   Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt and   dishonest person ever to seek the office   of the presidency   so it's in that context that I was asked   a question about whether i would agree   in advance to concede the results on   election night if for some reason we   should lose which we're not going to   lose and that was sort of an   unprecedented question if al gore or   george bush had agreed three weeks   before the election to concede the   results and waive their right to a legal   challenge or a recount then there would   be no supreme court case and no boar   gore versus bullish your Bush versus   Gore and there have been numerous other   cases in effect I'm being asked to waive   centuries of legal precedent designed to   protect the voters but listen to this   according to Pew highly respected there   are 24 million voter registrations in   the united states that are either   invalid or significantly inaccurate okay   I think the people in this room   understand it more than our leaders   although maybe our leaders understand   more than we think they understand   listen to this 1.8 million people are   dead but they're registered to vote some   of whom vote even though they're dead   which is really a hard thing to do   but it's easy if rod is involved right   see a 1.8 million people who were dead   who are registered to vote and some of   them vote one was a Republican and after   death became a democratic it's true 2.8   million people are registered in more   than one safe so you got two point eight   million people they can vote in Ohio and   so place else and fourteen percent of   non-citizens are registered to vote and   then I here we have such a beautiful   everything so wonderful you understand   what I'm coming from I think right now I   am NOT a politician so I can say it like   it is but those are terrible those are   terrible and frightening statistics   America is a constitutional republic   with a system of laws these laws are   triggered in the case of fraud or in the   event of a recount where it's needed of   course I would accept a clear election   result but I would also reserve my right   to contest or file a legal challenge in   the case of a questionable result   right   and always I will follow it abide by all   of the rules and traditions of all of   the many candidates who have come before   me always bottom line we're going to win   we're going to win we're going to win so   good we're gonna win so big november   eight we're going to win together we are   going to deliver real change that puts   again america first it's going to be   America   [Applause]   thank you what are you people have   spirit so early here if it's a beautiful   thing to see all over the country it's   the same the spirit it's a movement like   they've never seen that dishonest media   they've never seen anything like that   they've never seen I've never seen   anything like   they've never seen anything like we are   going to renegotiate our terrible trade   deals and illegal immigration stop the   massive inflow of refugees reduce   surging crime cut taxes and regulation   unleash job producing energy American   energy rebuild our military and take   care of our vets now our vets our great   veterans have not been taken care of the   way they should be taken care of that I   can tell you our vets are treated   oftentimes not as well as illegal   immigrants and we're going to change   that very fast our vets are going to be   treated properly and with great respect   that's not happening   and we are going to repeal and replace   Obamacare   [Applause]   just in case you haven't noticed rates   are going up sixty seventy eighty   percent next year's going to be worse   it's a catastrophe and it's dying anyway   but we're going to repeal it we place it   you can have great health care at a   fraction of the cost okay your jobs will   come back under a trump administration   you jobs a flail your incomes will go up   under a trump administration your taxes   will go way down under a trump   administration and Hillary Clinton is   going to raise your taxes she's going to   raise your taxes your companies won't be   leaving Ohio under a trump   administration right now our economy   isn't growing practically at all last   quarter it was only around one percent   gdp people have hardly ever heard of   numbers like that if in China it goes to   seven or eight percent it's like   considered a national catastrophe here   where one percent isn't everything   wonderful everything's not wonderful and   if it was wonderful we wouldn't have   packed auditoriums no matter where we go   Olivia I'm going to get us to four   percent growth and maybe more and create   25 million jobs for our country over the   next ten years many workers are earning   less today than they were 18 years ago   they're working harder they're working   longer but they're making less and in   some cases they're working two and three   jobs but still taking home less money   it's ridiculous they're getting older   they're working harder and so am i i'm   working harder and i'm getting all right   it was harder believe me I'm working on   it companies like carrier are firing   their workers and moving to Mexico   floored is moving all of their small car   production to Mexico what I'm president   if a company wants to fire their workers   and leave for Mexico or other countries   then we will charge them a thirty-five   percent tax when they want to ship their   products back into the United States and   they won't leave believe me those   companies will not believe if we do that   they will not leave and you know what if   they do that'll be fine we'll make a lot   of money but they're not going to be   leaving and our politicians should have   told you this years ago you would have   stopped this horrible onslaught of   companies leaving but two things either   than not very smart or they are smart   but they're controlled by their donors   and special interests okay so either way   the people lose your Clinton has raised   countless millions of dollars from big   donors who want to ship our jobs to   other countries you know that you saw   that last night remember which I said   open border it's the open border I don't   want open border but she turned out she   wanted open ones what wikileaks has done   a job on her hasn't   and you take a look she really has a   hatred almost for Catholics she's got a   hatred for evangelicals I mean what they   said about Catholics and evangelicals   and so many other things so many other   things and actually the one I liked was   John Podesta saying that who's her   campaign chairman saying that Hillary   Clinton has bad instincts she's got bad   interestings i don't want somebody with   bad instincts as our president i'll tell   you if I were Hilary I fired that guy he   said so many bad things well bill said   about Obamacare right two weeks ago he   said this is the craziest thing I've   ever seen he was right he suffered that   evening right he suffered but this is   why I'm proposing a package of ethic   reforms to make our government honest   once again it's time to drain the swamp   of corruption in Washington DC and we're   going to do   those reforms include the following a   five-year ban on executive branch and   congressional officials lobbying the   government after they leave government   service that make it a fortune not going   to have it that's why they make all   these sweetheart deals a lifetime ban on   former executive branch officials   lobbying on behalf of a foreign   government a ban on foreign lobbyists   raising money for American elections I   don't want that you don't want that   nobody wants it then you wonder why do   we make all these dumb deals and these   horrible deals friends who might come up   how could they have made such a stupid   deal they can't be as I said they are   actually smart but you have to   understand this is the way the system   works additionally i'm going to push for   a constitutional amendment to oppose   term limits on all members of god it's   about time not only will we end   government corruption but we will end   economic stagnation my plan for the   economy can be summed up in three very   beautiful words jobs jobs jobs   at the center of what will be a historic   jobs plan will be fixing our terrible   trade deals and they are terrible 47   million Americans are in poverty and 45   million Americans are right now on food   stamps we have nearly 800 billion annual   trade deficit in goods with the world   and the worst so-called recovery since   the Great Depression you know we hear   about a recovery so worse since the   Great Depression hard to believe Ohio   has lost one in four manufacturing jobs   since NAFTA and China's entrance into   the World Trade Organization two deals   done by Bill and back strongly by   crooked Hillary America has lost listen   to this seventy thousand factories since   China joined the WTO and by the way try   doing business over in China not easy   folks not easy we're living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world they're stealing our jobs   they're stealing our companies they're   taking our money we have drugs we have   debt we have empty factories that's   going to end that's going to end so easy   a trump administration is going to   renegotiate NAFTA the worst ever son   from the worst trade deal ever signed in   history stand up to foreign cheating and   currency manipulation and stop the jobs   from leaving our country we're going to   stop them it won't be hard   won't be hard in order to help bring our   jobs back to Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania   North Carolina all across this great   nation I'm going to undertake a major   reorganization of our bureaucracy which   we have to do up african american trade   policy is currently mismanaged by dozens   of competing bureaucracies spread across   the departments of agriculture commerce   labor state treasury all of these   departments so many departments get that   mosquito out of here little nurse with   mosquitoes nowadays folks but up here   you haven't been hit yet right that's   what we need is a nice mosquito bite   thank you i love you too mosquito I   dread smack in the middle of the nose   now we don't want it and my   administration all trade policy making   will be consolidated into one very   important office   we're going to call it the American desk   and it will be located inside the   department of commerce and I'll be   checking with those people because we're   not going to lose our companies anymore   it's so complicated so many different   departments have to get involved and by   the time they get involved they're gone   they signed with all of these other   countries the mission of the American   desk will be to protect the economic   interests of the American worker and the   national interests of the United States   because they're hurting our national   interests we owe 20 trillion dollars   right now doubled under Obama and we   haven't done anything all roads are bad   or airports are bad our schools are bad   everything's bad they're falling down so   we have all this debt we haven't started   yet because we have to fix the   infrastructure of our country it's going   to be America first believe me   as part of our plan to bring back our   jobs we're going to lower our business   tax from 35% to fifteen percent we're   also going to rebuild our inner cities   african-americans and Hispanics living   in the inner cities are suffering the   violence is unbearable and unbelievable   you walk to the store with your child   and you get shot there's no education   there are no jobs and there's   practically no safety nearly 3,500   people have been shot in Chicago since   the beginning of the year since january   first 3,500 people that's worse than   what you're reading about over in the   Middle East in many cases homicides are   up nearly fifty percent in Washington DC   and more than sixty percent in Baltimore   and it's getting worse to the   african-american and Hispanic   communities who are suffering I say what   do you have to lose vote for Donald   Trump I'm going to fix the inner self   I'm going to fix the inner city what do   you have to lose seriously and I mean it   the inner cities are so bad they've been   run so badly by Democrats for decades   and decades and decades sometimes more   than a hundred years unbroken and they   get the votes and they go on their way   and they don't do a thing so i hope the   african americans i hope the hispanics i   hope they've got a vote for Trump we're   going to do something about it believe   me big pink we will be a rich nation   once again but to be a rich country we   must also be a safe country and the   national security begins at the border   speaking in secret to a foreign bank   Hillary Clinton said her dream is for   totally open trade and open borders you   saw that last night when she tried to   lie about   right she tried to lie about it and she   came up with something she was talking   about energy she tried to lie about it   just like she lied about other things he   tried to lie lazar I remember she said   TPP which by the way is a disaster it   will be a disaster for Ohio they have no   no guards no synth guards they don't   talk about currency manipulation in the   agreement it's thousands of pages long   it's a disaster for Ohio and   Pennsylvania and any place that makes   anything it's bad Hillary's pan includes   an open border with the Middle East   meaning generations of radicalism and   terrorism spreading and growing within   our shores just last week and Iraqi   refugee approved for entry by Hillary   Clinton State Department pled guilty to   joining Isis there are many of them so   let me state this as clearly as I can if   I'm elected president of the United   States I am going to keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of our   [Applause]   we've got enough problems don't you   think don't you think we have enough   that will end up being the great Trojan   horse that they'll read about in 200   years like you read about Trojan horse   current that will be and we don't want   to be a part of that history we will   also stop the crisis of illegal   immigration a trump administration will   secure and defend our borders and yes we   will build the wall   [Applause]   and Mexico will pay for the wall we have   the first-ever endorsement from our ice   and Border Patrol officers first time   they ever endorsed a candidate for bread   every year countless American lives are   lost to sanctuary cities my opponent   strongly supports sanctuary cities I   don't think she knows why like the ones   that got Kate Steinle killed by a   five-time deported criminal illegal   immigrant if I'm elected president I'm   going to cut off federal funding to   sanctuary cities and quickly and we are   going to make sure that our immigration   authorities do the job that they're   supposed to be doing and these in many   cases of great people that are not   allowed to do the job I can tell you in   the case of the Border Patrol and the   ice agents these are great American   people that frankly by backing me   they're going to be working much harder   they don't have to stand back you know   the expression is called stand back   people just walk right into our country   we are going to save American lives   either we win this election or we are   going to lose this country   to sum up here are some of the amazing   things we're going to be doing for our   country starting in 2017 we are going to   have the biggest tax cut since Ronald   Reagan we will eliminate every   unnecessary job-killing regulation which   affects so many of them we will defend   our religious liberty we will provide   school choice to every low-income child   in America and we are going to end   Common Core education is going to be   what   we will totally support the men and   women of law enforcement   we talked about this last night at the   debate we will save the Second Amendment   which right now is under siege and I   will appoint justices to the United   States Supreme Court who will uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   States   you have 19 days to make every dream you   ever dreamed for your children for your   family for your country come true thank   you god bless you thank you our campaign   is powered by a love for this country   and our love for our fellow citizens and   is there any better place to be than a   trump rally or any safer place to it's a   campaign about rejecting the cynicism   and elitism of our failed political   establishment which is doing great harm   to everybody to us I am going to fight   for every citizen of every background   from every stretch of this nation I'm   going to fight for every child living in   poverty I'm going to fight for every mom   who lost their child to illegal   immigration and drugs and gang violence   I'm going to fight for every community   whose jobs and factories have been   ripped out of our states like Ohio and   Pennsylvania and Florida and so many   others you take a look at new england   you take a look at what's happened you   take a look at new york state upstate   New York and you see what's going on we   will never ever ever let that happen   again we're going to bring them back I'm   going to fight for every person in this   country who believes government should   serve the people not the donors and the   special   and I'm going to fight to bring us all   together as Americans imagine what our   country could accomplish if we started   working together as one people under one   God saluting one American flag   [Applause]   in 10 years in 20 years in 30 years   you're going

back soon we're   going to negotiate fair trade deals that   put American workers back to work that   put America first   [Applause]   we're going to stop the product dumping   the unfair foreign subsidies and the   currency manipulation that's absolutely   killing our companies and by the way   killing our jobs we're going to stop the   foreign cheating the era of economic   surrender which is what we've done   essentially is over a new era of   American greatness is going to begin and   it's going to start a little ahead of   schedule will consider the start date   November 8th that's when you go out to   vote   [Applause]   going to be a big day November 8th you   got to get out there no state has been   hurt worse really by Hillary Clinton on   trade policies than Ohio Hillary Clinton   back to her husband's NAFTA she backed   China's entrance into the World Trade   Organization she backed the job-killing   trade deal with South Korea which was a   disaster and backed TPP trans-pacific   partnership one bad deal after another   oh hi oh is lost nearly one in three   manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and   nearly one in four manufacturing jobs   since China entered the World Trade   Organization   that's really something these are deals   made at the top we have no leadership   we're going to have great leadership   we're going to bring our jobs back we're   going to open new companies you're going   to be so proud of your country once   again   [Applause]   a trade deficit in goods with the world   is now think of it eight hundred billion   dollars trade deficit can you imagine   that subtracts directly from our growth   our economy grew early one point one   percent in the last quarter a total   disaster a number that's so low they   went back and they checked and guess   what they found it was too high they had   a reduced it even further that was last   week   this is the legacy of Barack Obama this   is the legacy of Hillary Clinton if you   for any reason have a really bad day and   it happens to be Hillary it'll be four   more years of Obama but worse   it'll be four more years of high taxes   four more years of Isis growing all over   the place four more years of Obamacare   going up forty fifty sixty percent   nobody can afford it the deductibles are   so high it doesn't work anyway you have   to be hit by a truck and die slowly very   very slow you'll never get to use it   that's okay don't get hit by a truck I'm   promising you a new legacy for America   we're going to create a new American   future but to do that we have to stop   the Hara known as trans-pacific   partnership going to be a horrible deal   it will be perhaps as bad as NAFTA I   don't think anything will ever top and   after personally but it'll be very bad   our trade deficit with the proposed TPP   members countries cost the state of Ohio   more than one hundred thousand   manufacturing jobs just last year   imagine how many more jobs would be lost   if TPP was actually approved if it was   actually approved Hillary Clinton who   called key PP the gold standard would   100% approve it if she ever got in we   won't let that happen   [Applause]   we'll win this election and we'll keep   America out of TPP we will defend our   freedom our jobs and our economic   independence it's going to be America   first   my economic plan is going to grow this   economy raise your wages and create   millions and millions of new jobs for   this country   here are a few of the things that we're   going to do and we're gonna get them   done quickly a massive tax cut for   working Americans we're going to   eliminate regulations that kill American   jobs and that includes getting rid of   Obama administration's new anti energy   rules that will raise Ohio energy bills   by more than 40 percent very very   quickly Hillary Clinton say she wants to   put a lot of coal miners out of business   she wants to put him out of business   we're going to protect our coal miners   we're going to protect our steel workers   we're going to protect our factory the   how about factory workers the factories   that we have left the factories that we   have left we're going to protect our   workers we're going to put the miners   and the steel workers back to work we're   going to get your energy bills way down   where they should be we're going to   repeal and replace Obamacare   [Applause]   which by the way will save another 2   million jobs over the next decade we're   going to create jobs for all of our   people and we're going to fight to   ensure that every young african-american   and Latino job is put on the ladder of   American success and what that means is   a great education and a great job a   major part of this agenda includes   school choice school choice so important   merit pay for teachers and support for   our great charter schools and we're   going to bring your education local   folks we're going to get rid of Common   Core Common Core will be out we're   bringing it local bring it up local   I want every single child in this   country to be included in the American   dream another major part of our agenda   is immigration security we need to   protect American jobs security and   safety   don't worry we're gonna build that wall   that wall will go up it's going to go   [Applause]   we're gonna build the wall Mexico's   going to pay for the wall we're going to   stop drugs from coming in   [Applause]   we've got to stop the drugs from pouring   into our states   it's poisoning our youth and others our   youth is being poisoned people are being   poisoned and we've got to get accept and   we will get accept and we're going to   get it stopped quickly if I win quickly   last night I outlined a bold new   immigration reform to create prosperity   and opportunity for all of our people   especially those who have the least we   will treat everyone with dignity respect   and compassion but our greatest   compassion will be for the American   citizen   [Applause]   [Applause]   it will be from now on   America first I had a great meeting   yesterday with the President of Mexico   where we both expressed our shared   desire and it is a shared desire to   secure the border   put the cartels out of business and to   keep jobs in our hemisphere   but let's also talk about government   corruption no issue better illustrates   how corrupt my opponent is than her   pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of   State here is one example of Clinton   corruption as Secretary of State Hillary   Clinton signed off on a deal allowing   Russians to take an increased stake in a   company called uranium 1 giving up   control of about 20% of America's   uranium supply to the Russians you know   how important uranium is you know what   it represents Clinton's approval of the   deal netted the owners of uranium   company millions of dollars in exchange   for signing off the deal some of the   former owners of uranium 1 gave the   Clinton Foundation many millions of   dollars in donations   in addition bailant received $500,000   for his speech   I mean think of this - a Kremlin backed   investment firm that was a big big   beneficiary of the deal here's another   example of pay-for-play   in the Clinton State Department in 2009   a telecom giant named Ericsson came   under US pressure for selling telecom   equipment to several oppressive   governments including Sudan Syria and   always Iran   it's Iran they're involved in a lot of   stuff aren't they some of these regimes   use those technologies to monitor and   control their own people in June 2011   Hillary Clinton State Department began   adding goods and services to a list that   might be covered under expanded   sanctions on Iran and other state   sponsors of terrorism during that time   Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill   Clinton paying him seven hundred and   fifty thousand dollars his highest   paying speech in April 2012 the Obama   administration issued an executive order   imposing sanctions on telecom sales to   Iran and Syria but those sanctions did   not cover   Erikson's work in Iran I wonder why a   trump administration will end government   corruption no one will be above the law   [Applause]   we will have one set of rules for   everyone in Hillary Clinton's world we   have one set of rules for her and   another set of rules for everybody else   I'm fighting for everyone who doesn't   have a voice we are soon going to have a   voice   [Applause]   I'm fighting for the Forgotten men and   women of America forgotten believe me   forgotten I am your voice I didn't need   to do this folks I'm spending a lot of   money   I'm not having those big checks written   like you know who's getting spent a lot   of money but you know what in the end   it's going to be so worth it because   we're going to make America great again   [Applause]   Hilary Clinton's campaign is funded by   Wall Street and hedge fund managers my   campaign is powered by my money but also   by small dollar donations from people   working all across the country who want   a better future for their children   nothing terrifies the ruling class more   than when everybody and everyday working   people give five ten fifteen sixty   eighty a hundred dollars to help us take   government away from the special   interests and give it back to the voters   come November 8 we are once again going   to have a government that serves you   your family and your country than I have   we're going to rebuild our depleted   military avoid needless foreign wars   build new friendships overseas and   remember those three famous words peace   through strength   [Applause]   we're going to work with our allies to   crush defeat and utterly destroy Isis   we're going to have a new immigration   screening test for entry into the United   States we only want to admit those into   our country who share our values and   love our people and I mean love our   people   my tax reforms will add millions of new   jobs and thousands of new small   businesses my energy reforms will create   millions of new jobs and lower the price   of your energy bill   very very substantially my trade reforms   will raise wages grow jobs and trillions   and new wealth into our country we are   going to become a wealthy country again   and we will be able to do things that   were not even thinking about right now   we we are not even thinking about what   we're supposed to be doing my   infrastructure plans will rebuild your   roads your bridges your tunnels your   railways your airports and they are a   mess   my regulatory reforms will make it   easier for small businesses to thrive   including

[Music]   I   [Music]   and   [Music]   and   [Music]   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Applause]   have you been seeing what's happening   with those bowls that like rocket ships   I'll tell you spring break I love Ohio   [Applause]   did well in Ohio gave me confidence to   go out with life but right at the   beginning I was in Ohio so we're love it   thank you everyone for coming in portage   we are going to win the great state of   Ohio   the one knows   new polls just out have us with a very   substantial lead in Ohio nationwide   we're looking great in time we're   looking great in North Carolina we are   looking great in the state of   Pennsylvania we just left your nap sure   we have a lead in New Hampshire these   very dishonest people back to the media   to get it   you can order personally you can show   off in november eight who is loaded   right but you shaving it a little red   thing   wanna be tradition   real change begins with immediately   repealing and replacing horrible   Obamacare   gentlemen announced that the residents   of Ohio are going to experience massive   massive problems with their obamacare   you know about that I guess right you   know about it's a serious problem it is   a serious problem and you're going to   have numbers in the great state of   Arizona it's got up 116 percent okay 116   percent so you can have a lot of   problems we're going to work on it very   hard 88 counties in Ohio are losing at   least 3 Obamacare ensures a year okay so   next year you're going to have almost   almost nobody even to negotiate with by   next year but it's not going to matter   because if we win the election you're   not going to have Obamacare do   [Applause]   nothing to worry about believe me and we   are going to have great health care at a   much lower price and it's going to be   something you're going to be very proud   of right now it's an international joke   Obamacare to international joke dreams   are surging companies are leaving   ensures of fleeing doctors are quitting   I know so many doctors they quit and   generally speaking deductibles are going   through the roof some higher than others   we have deductibles I've heard as high   as fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars   yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down   and Obamacare making it even more   expensive I'm asking for your loan so we   can replace Obamacare and save health   care for every family in Ohio but more   importantly because we don't want to   think of ourselves for every family in   the United States to pick   [Applause]   real change also means restoring honesty   to government so we want to start by   getting rid of Hillary Clinton   [Applause]   the FBI now has multiple open criminal   investigations going on Hillary Clinton   lots of bad things are happening lots of   really bad things are happening but I'll   tell you what you're going to be amazed   when it's all finished when you look at   how it's all flushing out the system is   a beautiful system when it works we have   a rigged system so many times you see   this I mean you have things going on   there incredible that includes a   discovery of another 650,000 emails and   also a criminal investigation into her   pay-for-play corruption at the State   Department last night was just confirmed   that the six hundred and fifty thousand   emails include brand new emails not   previously seen by authorities likely   including classified information   Hilary is now facing major problems with   perjury the FBI agents say their   investigation is likely to yield perhaps   an indictment the reports also show that   the political leadership at the   Department of Justice is trying as hard   as they can to protect your angel Heller   this is the wager they want to protect   their range   did we ever have a situation like this   is first of all forget about as of last   Friday with the new 650,000 emails it   was bad to get that she should have been   disqualified for running for president   from the first   I mean take a look at the first batch   what we even have to go now we're doing   it all look what we found how many times   do we have to do this I believe the FBI   wanted to do it and she was protected by   friends of hers at the Department of   Justice that's the department where as   you know the Attorney General was on the   airplane now they said was for 45   minutes talking about the grandchildren   I'm talking about God 447   I don't think so   I think they were talking about a   position in other words a continuation   of a position I think that's what they   were talking about folks Hilary is   engaged in a criminal massive enterprise   and cover-ups like probably nobody ever   before remember John Podesta said she   has bad instincts and you know she was   getting off the plane they would just   announcing new wiki leaks that i wanted   to say there but I didn't want to keep   you waiting   the plan   [Applause]   I didn't wanna go there were some   beauties coming out and I'm saying do I   listen for another you know you can   listen for hours but think of it John   Podesta her top person such as bad   instincts for the hell wants a president   where the person that knows her best at   her instincts her bed now Bernie Sanders   such as bad judgment but at least he was   running against her right but the person   working with idea what I would fire   Podesta very quickly by word you should   be fired and honestly shouldn't Huma be   fired I mean can you imagine can you   imagine did you get rid of all the   emails yes ma'am they're all gone yes   ma'am this is gone up for month did you   get rid of the emails yes ma'am they're   gone we deleted 33,000 up they're all   gone I think we're in the clear and then   they find out going through a pervert   time   Anthony Weiner anybody in New York does   all about Anthony where and I predicted   in the year-ago did you hear me right   and I said all the things I said and   they all said what a horrible thing to   say I turned out to be right answer even   some of these very dishonest people in   the media said Trump roll call that one   I called a lot of I called the bottom   but can you imagine whom I i get rid of   they're all gone 33,000 didn't I do a   good job and then they find out oh we   got bad news boss   they I think they went on the cloud you   know the time   never disappears off the clap for those   people when they advertise the cloud   ever disappears she said was we're bad   news they just found 650,000 emails can   you imagine and I'll tell you some of   those emails all i would get anything   some of those emails are so bad they're   so classified debbie on classical they   have emails there that are beyond   classified   it's all coming down because I've always   had a lot of confidence in the FBI they   give amazing people in the area and   they're not happy they're not happy   about life what's happened and then not   happy about the way they're being pushed   around and you don't push them around   for long believe me she created an   illegal email sir to shield their   criminal activity and corrupt pay for   play and then she illegally destroyed 33   thousand emails after this is the big   key after the secure after receiving a   congressional subpoena so after so she   gets to subpoena and she says get rid of   it and that's fine and yet they put four   star general last week james Cartwright   highly respected current four-star   general they may put him in jail for up   to five years for doing nothing by   comparison General Petraeus has suffered   suffered horribly reputation destroyed   for doing nothing by comparison they   took the kid who wanted some pictures of   the submarine that's an old separate   they got plenty of pictures in the enemy   wants if they got bloody other he wanted   him took a couple of pictures they put   him in jail for a year I saw his mother   the other night on television   I'll tell you what folks we've never   been in a situation like this and then   she's allowed to run for president and   general Cartwright is put in jail for   doing he knows but he said he did it and   he said he'd after he said that he lied   for national security purposes who knows   but he did nothing by comparison to what   she's done if she were to win it would   create an unprecedented constitutional   crisis she is likely to be under   investigation for a long time concluding   probably in a criminal trial we all want   to go through a process and we want to   make sure everyone is guilty properly   guilty properly everything has to be   perfect but she did things where and we   have on trial have to go but what she's   guilty she's guilty just if you took   theme as and that's the least of what   you did she got rid of emails that's the   least of what she did if she ever got   into the Oval Office Hilary and her   corrupt friends would rob this country   blind   my contract with the American voter   begins with a plan to end government   corruption   entire corrupt Washington establish to   hear and heed the words we all are about   to say we all you ready it's an amazing   how this phrase is called I didn't like   it I thought it was corny I thought it   was really sort of corny phrase I didn't   like it when we win a November rate   we're going to Washington DC and we are   going to drag   [Applause]   they're all screaming drain the swamp   but Frank Sinatra didn't like by what he   did like till he sang it Jordan's went   crazy sang it again became number one   over suddenly loved it very much at the   core of my contract is my plan to bring   back our jobs   one informants manufacturing jobs and   staff there deal signed by Bill clip and   supported by crooked Hillary Clinton   America's lost us one of the hardest   things to believe because it doesn't   seem physically possible 70,000 factory   since China entered the World Trade   Organization another bill and hillary   backed disaster we're living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world it's true it's a single   greatest job step you take a look at   what's happened not only are you look at   upstate New York you look in   Pennsylvania look at North Carolina look   at South Carolina you look at what's   going to look at new england new england   boy they got in general motors laid off   1151 works in moraine and move their   jobs to Mexico China and various other   countries   for easier laid off 356 workers in Troy   anybody from Troy good do you still have   your job and move their jobs to Mexican   Delphi later 5805 what's with delphi you   know about that right 5805 workers in   date boy oh boy that's a lot of jobs and   move their jobs to Mexico   we have a one-way highway going into   some of these countries especially   Mexico everything goes in I always say   they get the jobs the plants the money   we give the drugs we get the   unemployment so one way street not going   to happen any more folks knock it out   there has to be consequences when that   happens they're going to be consequences   we're going to fight I don't worry but   we'll build them all it's gonna be   [Applause]   and every time I see a Delphi and every   time I see these companies leaving that   ball gets a little bit higher we're   going to fight for workers and we're   going to fight the Delphi of these other   companies don't leave us and they're   going to be consequences because the   people got a raw deal and they deserve   so much better at Trump administration   will stop the jobs from leaving Ohio or   from leaving America and will stop the   jobs I tell you wat like you've never   seen before it will happen quickly the   theft of American prosperity will end if   a company wants to fire their workers   leave Ohio move to another country build   their big beautiful factory ship their   products back into the United States we   will make them pay thirty-five percent   tax going through a very strong   and you know what's gonna happen did not   get a little doctor later now the   politicians could do something about   this how long have we been talking about   this 15 years he's got really bad over   the last five or six years really bit   it's gotten to be catastrophic   catastrophic but they know this I mean   some dude something some are not exactly   I want sex   some are too bright that mark and some   are getting tremendous amounts of money   from donors and from people that want to   see those companies leave they have   reasons for the companies to leave   including ownership interest and those   companies the problem is the politicians   are working for those donors they're not   working for the American people they're   not working for all the people that got   fired what we're good job so what's   going to happen is they won't leave and   the ones who do leave that's okay too   because the country will make a fortune   because that's going to be called the   consequence we can stop it dead and as   we speak right now you have leaders in   your cup going out right now as we're   sweeping you have leaders going out join   to negotiate deals to leave Ohio in   other places go to Mexico go to other   countries but don't worry about it   because if I get elected that we very   little negotiation a drop another   stretch we'll renegotiate NAFTA and if   we don't get the deal we want we will   terminate after and get a much better   deal for our workers i want free traffic   once we try to keep going the free tract   when I 1332 but i really want fair trade   fair for this country and for our   workers that's what's going to be we're   gonna fair fair trade   we will also immediately stop the   job-killing trans-pacific partnership   from happening that's going to be next   that's another NAFTA potential as part   of our plan to bring back jobs we're   going to lower taxes on American   business from thirty-five percent of we   will massively cut taxes for the middle   class we will also unleash American   energy including jail oil natural gas   and clean coal we're going to put   we're going to put our steel workers   back to work   we will cancel baby after the global   warming payments to the United Nations   [Applause]   by the way nobody even knows what   happens to that one I could that's a   pretty good idea but nobody even knows   what happens and we will use that one to   invest in America that includes proj is   like improving Interstate 71 car does   anybody like that I got it like a lot of   islip save the money you know we owe 20   trillion okay do you like the idea of   improving the interstate I mean it's not   exactly you're not thrilled by it let's   not do with that with it let's save the   money and replacing the Brent Spence   bridge and since I which is critical to   the region you like that one better   you know we should do that before we do   a project have a big rally how do you   like doing the interstate people god I   do you like doing the bridge all we love

experienced   their largest single increase in 45   years now the dishonest media doesn't   tell you that they don't want you to   know that firearm related deaths the   police officers are up forty five   percent just now just a couple of hours   ago to New York City police offers   supposed to be too great people were   shot in the Bronx badly badly shot we   send our thoughts and prayers to the   officers on their families just happened   moments before I left the plane   unbelievable a trump administration will   protect those who protect us and we will   stop this tremendous surge in crime   we will also keep America safe from   terrorism Hillary Clinton wants a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees flowing into our country   that's above the thousands that are   coming in now under the Obama plan five   hundred and fifty percent above the   thousands already coming in her plan   will import generations of terrorism   extremism and radicalism and it's   something we can't allow to happen   they'll be in our schools they'll be in   our communities and honestly we want to   take care of people and we have to and   will help them we'll build safe havens   will get the Gulf states who have   nothing but money and they haven't done   their job they will pay for it we're not   paying for it we have 20 trillion we're   not paying for it when I'm elected   president so we will take care of it we   want everybody who wants to take care of   it but we don't want to end up like   France you see what's happening in Paris   and nice you see what's happening in   Germany the problems we have enough   problems in our country we will suspend   the Syrian refugee program and we will   keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell   out of our country   [Applause]   and we have a president by the way all   he does his campaign shouldn't he be   back like trying to get jobs and working   on Isis and maybe not giving a four   month notice that we're going into Mosul   to attack them you saw that whole   situation we will be attacking Mosul in   four months I say why don't don't tell   me I don't want to hear that because we   are going to capture the leaders of Isis   by attacking mausam you see what's going   on right I'd say it all the time and   every military leader general Flynn was   great general Kellogg they're all saying   you're so right so we have a president   frankly doesn't know what the hell he's   doing he doesn't know what look at   what's happening with so many things   whether it's jobs but why is he spending   all of his time campaigning for somebody   under federal investigation all he does   is campaign and campaign he ought to be   back in the Oval Office he ought to be   back there working he ought to be back   there working   [Applause]   I have a lot of good suggestions up here   okay so we're going to make our country   strong again we're going to build up our   military which is so badly depleted so   badly depleted you know these are the   greatest people there are and we have   old equipment we have old fighter jets   we have all planes and guns and   everything the enemy has newer and   better equipment than we do in many   cases recently they had a documentary on   the Jets they're 18 19 years old you saw   it look a lot of people solve it where   they can't replace the parts they can't   replace the parts they have to go to   plane graveyards and plain museums   because they don't make the parts that   anymore so all of these things are   happening we are going to have a   top-notch modern military we don't have   a choice we don't have a choice   [Applause]   we are going to do something else how   many vets are in the audience wow that's   a lot of vets we are going to take care   of our vets and we're going to take care   of them properly we have illegal   immigrants coming into the country that   are taking better care of then our vets   and that's not going to happen that's   not going to happen our vets are waiting   on line for five days six days seven   days 10 days to see a doctor for a   simple procedure or a simple   prescription not going to happen anymore   not going to happen you know that and   this is a number two numbers are the   hardest to believe that we lost seventy   seven thousand factories that i told you   about 77 I thought they meant 700   factories or 7,000 77,000 the other one   is that we have a suicide rate 22 vets a   day it's I said that can't be right you   mean 22 a year no 22 a day and a lot of   that is because of the horrible horrible   situation that's taking place run by the   Veterans Administration and this has   gone on for years and Hillary's Hillary   Clinton said it's fine it's just fine   the way it is and you know that she said   it's just fine the way it is and that's   the thing during the debates it was very   interesting and I did win the debates in   all fairness you   did you see where she said all the time   I'm in debate prep Hillary Clinton is   debating I mean she's in the bedroom she   is in debate prep she was in there for   weeks you know what it was it was really   an excuse for her to go to sleep and Rex   she was in debate prep now I kept   hearing I felt guilty she'd sort like a   week and a half before and she was in   debate prep she wasn't a debate prep and   the truth is if you don't know the   subject so well that you have to prep   for two weeks you're the wrong person   anyway but it was really an excuse for   her to sleep and to rest okay but we did   well so we did win the debates right   every poem every single poll said we won   the debates but I I learned something in   the debates because she's saying we will   fight Isis we will do this we will do   that we don't like what you did with   taxes startled trunk I said well that's   okay why didn't you change the tax cut   by the way all of her friends do the   same thing torrent but why don't you   change the tax code you were there you   were senator Secretary of State you're   with I mean you were the wife of the   president she doesn't like it you know   so I'd watch she's like a critic she   complains but she'll never do anything   about it she said we'll get rid of Isis   well there was no Isis when she became   Secretary of State ice is formed during   her tenure right it came out of the   vacuum because the way they got out of   Iraq was unbelievable he's stupid and   ice is formed now they're in 32   countries she has zero chance of getting   rid of Isis I have one hundred percent   chance okay i have 100   we have no choices is like we're living   in medieval times this is it like it's   war and people get shot and people get   killed and it's horrible this is   people's heads are chopped off by the   hundreds by the thousands and if you   Christian you have no chance and it's   very hard you know if you're in Syria   I've heard this for years it's amazing   even before the migration if you're a   Christian it was almost impossible to   come into the United States almost   impossible and yet these people were   under this horrible horrible rule and   they were being decimated and killed and   by the way the evangelicals Christians   Jews Catholics I have such tremendous   support it's unbelievable some believe   it's unbelievable so we're going to do   things that are going to make you very   proud or we're going to be strong again   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and as I said when these young   attractive people started screaming they   want the wall we will build a wall that   will make you so happy to that group   over there   a lot of uthia we're going to build a   great wall and Mexico's going to pay for   the wall and the reason we're gonna have   a great relationship with Mexico the   mexican president short while ago very   nice with a great meeting but mexico is   beating us at the border they're killing   us entre we have a trade deficit with   mexico that nobody would believe it's a   fraction of what we're talking about   with respect to the cost of the world   because a lot of politicians ask me the   question how are you going to get Mexico   to pay I said when you see their trade   deficit billions and billions of dollars   and you look at the cost of the wall   then you'll understand how easy it's   going to be so we're going to build a   wall it'll be a great wall Mexico's   gonna pay for the wall we're going to   stop those drugs from pouring in and   poisoning are you we're gonna stop it   and it will be a great well maybe   someday they'll name it after Trump who   the hell knows I really don't know if I   want a wall but that's we received the   first-ever endorsement from our ice and   Border Patrol officers   it's just been reported that as a result   of our open borders violent   transnational cartels have spread into   all 50 of our state's you've read that   more than ninety percent of those   arrests are here illegally so ninety   percent of the people that are here   doing the things that you and I know   they're doing are in our country   illegally they're killing innocent   Americans and others threatening schools   and totally destroying communities a   government that will not protect its   people is a government unworthy to lead   unworthy to leave I mean think of it   think of it with respect to radical   Islam where you have a president that   won't mention the words and you have a   candidate that won't say radical Islamic   terrorism how do you solve a problem if   you refuse to acknowledge it Hillary   will never protect your family which is   why she can never lead this country but   that's only one reason why the other   reason why is that she is guilty of so   many crimes and that's why it's a rigged   system because she should not be allowed   to run and when you look at what's going   on with her protection you'll understand   exactly what I'm saying when I say   rigged system you can ask Bernie Sanders   about a rigged system the mistake he   made what he endorsed Hillary Clinton he   made a deal with the devil and his stock   went way down and we're going to get a   lot of Bernie Sanders people supporting   us because he was right about one thing   he was right about the borders and trade   and you know what I'm much tougher on   trade that he was ever   ever and a lot of his people are coming   over should have never made a deal he   would have gone down as a great person   in political history had he not made   that deal and now he just goes out and   speaks before small crowds and then you   see WikiLeaks all the bad things they   say about him that alone should stop it   that alone should stop it and just like   I said that's why Hillary should fire   Podesta how do you have people working   that say these horrible things about you   where I love reading those WikiLeaks the   immigration office is warned in their   letter when they endorsed me that   Hillary's plan is the most radical   immigration proposal in the United   States history it will lead to the loss   of thousands and thousands of lives and   they know what they're talking about   folks as Secretary of State Hillary   Clinton allowed many many many people   the most dangerous and violent criminal   aliens to go free because their home   countries refuse to take them back now I   don't blame their home countries but   well we catch drug lords killers gang   members and we bring them back into   their home country I give you my word   there won't be one instance where that   country doesn't take those people   and we are going to have a plan because   they keep coming back and back and back   and back because we're weak and were   ineffective when they come back five   years in jail when they come back again   more than five years in jail and when   they come back a third time much longer   than that let me tell you folks that   never coming back it's a very simple   solution than never coming back they'd   come back 12 x 13 times they look at us   they laugh Hillary supports totally open   borders there goes your country and   strongly support sanctuary cities like   San Francisco where Kate Steinle was   murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported at least five times here in   Ohio 60 year old Margaret Castle dick   was murdered in cold blood by an illegal   immigrant last July in nearby concord   township earlier that day her illegal   immigrant killer attempted to rape a   fourteen-year-old girl and shot another   woman while she was with her children in   the park police encountered the illegal   immigrant more than three weeks before   the crime spree but federal authorities   refused to take him in just refused to   take him into custody he was set free   and then he went out and killed Margaret   and people that knew him by the way were   begging begging that he'd be   incarcerated but our weak immigration   policies are responsible for many many   deaths many deaths a trump   administration will end this nightmare   of violence we will protect American   lives we will cancel all federal funding   to sanctuary cities we will stop illegal   immigration deport all criminal aliens   and dismantle every last criminal cartel   and it will happen within the first week   of my presidency   [Applause]   when we win you will finally have a   government on your side fighting for   your community and protecting your   family   we will also repeal the obama-clinton   defense sequester and rebuild our so   badly depleted military we will build   new advanced aircraft at places like   wright-patterson Air Force Base you like   that place I like it too I'm honored to   have the endorsement of more than 200   top Admirals and generals and more than   22 medal of honor recipients they were   with me last night we're in Fort Bragg   that was an amazing evening we had   21,000 people last night most incredible   brave people you've ever seen Hillary   brought death and disaster to Iraq Syria   Libya she empowered Iran and she   Unleashed Isis across the world that's   what she did through and competence   through gross incompetency and Obama   Unleashed Isis now she wants to start a   shooting war in Syrian conflict with a   nuclear-armed Russia that could easily   lead to World War three she's an   unstable person folks I know my people   she's an unstable person I mean look at   the way she handled this email mess do   you want that handling our country   Hilary and our failed establishment have   spent listen to this one this is the new   number six trillion dollars on wars in   the Middle East that we never win that   go on forever never win them I wonder   what General MacArthur would say I   wonder what General George Patton is   spinning he's going to spin they're   spinning in their graves they made us   less safe they've shipped our jobs and   our wealth to other countries and   they've left our borders wide open at   home we send troops to fight and die and   defend our borders but we don't care   about our borders we're more interested   in defending the borders of countries   that a lot of people have never even   heard of some believable think of it we   fight to defend a border and someplace   far away but we don't even have borders   in our country that will change in   november eighth   and by the way two things I want people   to come into our country we're going to   have Aegis 7 a big and beautiful door   we're going to have the big beautiful   doors but they're going to come into our   country legally legal they're coming   into our country legally and the process   is going to be speeded up and it's going   to be brought into a modern age it's now   archaic people in line for 10 and 12   years but people are going to come in we   want people to come into our country but   they're going to come in through a   process they're going to come in Legally   a trump administration will never ever   put the interests of a foreign country   before the interests of our country   I'm not running to be President of the   world to believe me I'm running to be   president of our great United States of   America   I   and from the day I take office it will   be always America first to all Americans   I say it's time for change in it's time   for new leadership can you imagine four   years of Hillary Clinton now I mean   seriously forget about running forget   about the race can you imagine four more   years of Isis four more years of high   taxes four more years of nothing but   problems in addition to all of the   legalities that she's done ayeeee ayeeee   I don't even like to think about it just   think about in closing what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trump administration we are going to   have the biggest tax cut since Ronald   Reagan she is raising taxes very   seriously you saw her tax increase its   massive you know we have the highest tax   nation in the world and she wants to   raise taxes we're going to eliminate so   many different things but our taxes are   going way down and we're going to get   rid of all unnecessary job-killing   regulations we're going to cancel every   illegal Obama executive order we will   protect religious liberty   rebuild our military and we are going to   take great care as I said of our   veterans provide school choice and put   an end to common core we're bringing   education local we will support the   great men and women of law enforcement   we're going to save our Second Amendment   which is under siege and appoint   justices to the Supreme Court who will   hold you know this look this is one of   the most serious things Justice Scalia   died very unexpectedly we have one the   next president could appoint as many as   34 I mean there's even a scenario it   could be five if we don't get this right   we will not have a country many people   think it's like the most important thing   so we're going to appoint justices to   the United States Supreme Court who will   uphold and defend the Constitution of   the United States so important   for all those people that don't even   mention that it's one of the really   important elements of what we're doing   and one of the very most important   things that we're going to be doing it   is time to cut our ties with the fail   politicians of the past Hillary Clinton   is a candidate of yesterday we are the   movement of the future we are fighting   for every citizen who believes that   government should serve the people not   the donors and not the special entry we   are fighting to save everything honestly   we're fighting to save everything we're   not just looking at having a strong   military and having that we're fighting   to save everything our country is a   total mess you just take a look you just   take a look we're also fighting to get   rid of sanctuary cities we're fighting   to get rid of sanctuary cities we're   fighting to save the next worker from   being laid off when their job is ship   unexpectedly to another country we're   fighting to save our government from   crime corruption you look at what's   happening our government's being eaten   alive cronyism and kick the crooks out   of Washington DC don't let the pundits   the politicians of the media tell you   what kind of a country you have don't   let them limit your dreams because they   want to limit your dreams you can have   any future you want all we have to do is   stop believing in our failed politicians   and start believing in America again   I'm asking you to reject the cynics and   to dream big because with your vote we   are just four days can you believe it   four days this started on june sixteenth   of last year it seemed like it was never   going to end 17 people 17 people one by   one by one they said Donald Trump is   inexperienced I've been in politics on   my life but I've been on the other side   of the equation i'm not saying but one   by one by one and then they disappeared   some great people ben Carson supporting   us incredibly Mike Huckabee so many   great every so many cool almost all of   them great people and we actually do   have a very unified Republican Party   I'll tell you but most importantly we're   going to make such great decisions for   this country we're going to make such   great you're going to be so proud but so   think of a june sixteenth of last year   and now it's four days away from the   change you've been waiting for your   entire life   you're gonna think back to this day and   you're gonna say that was a great day   that was a beautiful day I even like mr.   Trump's plane made in America by the way   was better than me he's made in America   I don't make them like that anywhere   else but you're going to say this was a   very very important day because it led   to your vote on november eighth or   whenever you do it before that is fine   just as long as you do it do it anytime   you want but do it and our country   started winning again we started winning   with trade we started doing things   properly we built up our military we   knocked the hell out of Isis we started   winning again we took care of health   care we got great health care at a much   much much lower cost it's unacceptable   but we started winning again together we   are going to make America wealthy again   we will make America so very strong   again we will make America safe again   and we will make America great again   thank you very much everybody thank you   God bless you everybody god bless you   get out and vote thank you thank you   everybody   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you
BLulODCrMks~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160913~Full Speech: Donald & Ivanka Trump Unveil Child Care & Maternity Plan In Aston, PA (9/13/2016)~20584.0~4.79428577423~498.0~27.0~   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Applause]   ladies please welcome   [Applause]   years ago about a single mother   basically his child care arrangements   warning final job career options   she made the tragic choice young   children and a heart hot car while she   attempted to secure the job in order to   better the life of her family she   returned to the parking lot all of the   interview to find her vehicle surrounded   by police   her children had been hospitalized she   was jailed charge for system one that is   too expensive too outdated and too   accessible come up time and time again   just last week I spoke of the military   spouse who recounted their vicious cycle   responsible for holding so many of   America   she related to me the frustration I've   heard all too often I'm not being able   to work and bring home a second income   the issue   stories like these restrict my heart and   I filled my belief that there has to be   a better way I have three young children   myself and I'm grateful daily but the   means to pursue true abundance being a   mother and investing in a career that I   recognize that far too few hundred to   say the same for themselves and that I   am more fortunate Phyllis this must   change society we need to create   policies of champion all parents   enabling the American family to throw   away my dad agrees and he's a very   unique position to do something about   this problem and in numerous other   problems facing tens of millions of   parents and caregivers across our   country today child care is single   greatest expense for many Americans   even exceeding the cost of housing in   much of the country   it's depleting the hard-earned savings   of men and women across our nation and   it's as a root of wage inequality by   disproportionately affecting women the   policies that are in place affected   families were written one is 65 years   ago to serve primarily male workforce   that no longer exists dual income   families were not the norm in 1949 when   the current tax code provisions   regarding families are established today   however women represent 47 percent of   the u.s. labor force and in almost   two-thirds in married couples both   spouses work outside the home 70 percent   of mothers with children at home also   work in a professional capacity and 64   percent of these models have kids aged 6   and under the number of household slid   by single mothers has doubled in the   last 30 years an approximately   two-thirds of these women working   low-wage jobs that offer neither   flexibility nor venomous   my father has created   designed to bring relief and to provide   working parents with options so that   they can make the decisions that are in   the best interests of their families   safe affordable high quality child care   should not be the luxury unfortunate few   historically this is not an area that   has received nearly as much attention in   the policy world as it deserves while   there are systems in place for older   children hardly any intellectual energy   has been devoted to addressing the needs   of families with children from birth to   four years old in particular little   focus has been put on determining how   best to alleviate the enormous financial   burdens child care places on low-income   and millon   at the same time the United States is   the only industrialized nation in the   world that does not provide mothers with   paid maternity leave my father's policy   will give paid leave to mothers whose   employers are lovely almost 90 percent   of US businesses that currently do not   offer this benefit this is a reform that   is a critical value and long overdue my   father's plan also recognizes supports   that many women who may not be mothers   but who are have left paying jobs to   provide care for elderly dependents this   is another example of people who have   been routinely or by several policies   having employed and empowered women at   every level of this company throughout   this entire air my father understands   the needs of the modern workforce and   it's offering a new and innovative   solution where others have not   the vital contribution of stay-at-home   moms and parents fathers and mothers who   will ensure that they too will receive   using new tax methods raising children   full-time is one of the hardest jobs   anyone can do and it's essential that   our policies recognize and honor that   reality as an implement as an employer a   mother and a woman who works both inside   and outside the home these are topics I   consider a critical importance   the policy my father's about to outline   is one that I'm proud of healthy   sexuality and ensuring its enactment   will be one of my top priorities when   he's elected come November   it's a family issue it's an American   issue it's an issue that's often to   discuss but as yet to be solved my   father plans to change that   and now he will tell you my admiration   it's a great angry I ended yet to you   our next president   and my father Donald J John   [Applause]   thank you everybody that's very nice   thank you very much and I want to   applaud my daughter Ivanka for her work   and leadership on this issue   she has been working her so very hard   Ivanka has been deeply invested in this   since long before the campaign began I   can tell you that and I'm very grateful   to her for her work or efforts and this   proposal which we're going to be   outlining right away I think it's gonna   make a lot of people very very happy a   lot of moms very happy I want to also   take a moment to recognize congresswoman   cathy McMorris Rodgers the chairwoman of   the House Republican Conference and a   mother of three small children who's   been such a leader and worked so hard   with us so Cathy we want to thank you   very much also we're joined tonight by   some amazing members of Congress in our   audience Congress women Blackburn Lewis   Black Arts Lee and Elmer's come on up   here   come on they worked so hard on this come   on   [Applause]   well I will tell you my name is Marsha   Blackburn thank you all of you for the   reception that you have given to us and   I want to say a special thank you to mr.   Trump focusing on the issues that affect   working women is something that is   vitally important to each of us standing   on this stage we come from a variety of   backgrounds we have a nurse we have   farmers we have ranchers we have   teachers we have small business owners   and entrepreneurs that's the skill set   that we bring to Congress and the   experience that we've draw from and we   know that each of you are much like us   those are the experiences that you have   we know that there are issues when it   comes to child care when it comes to   dealing with the workplace and just as   Ivanka said so perfectly this is a   family issue we know men always want   more money what do women want more time   and we're thrilled to finally have a   President of the United States who is   going to put the focus on working with   women to make certain that you can   achieve your American dream thank you so   much   thank you very much and Mayor Giuliani   please stand up enjoy   [Applause]   the nation's man oh he's done a good job   so our campaign is about ideas we're   about solutions to big big problems   problems that have gone on forever I've   traveled all over the country in recent   weeks offering detailed plans to make   life better for you and for your family   so important to me I've outlined   detailed proposals for providing school   choice they have to do that reforming   our tax and regulatory code   lifting restrictions on American energy   rebuilding our military changing our   foreign policy fixing our immigration so   important and keeping our country sink   [Applause]   right now thank you   right now our politicians have locked   our country into endless fights about   small and petty things I'm asking the   nation to lift our sights and to imagine   what we can accomplish if we work   together trust each other and put the   needs of our citizens first for a change   we must break our ties with the failed   and bitter politics and policies of the   past and pursue a future where every   American is honored and I mean really   honored and respected we have to reject   the arrogance of Washington DC that   looks down on everyday hardworking   people and that's what's happening too   often those who have power have disdain   for the views beliefs and attitudes of   those who don't have any political power   those in leadership must put themselves   in the shoes of the ladle factory worker   the family worried about security or the   mom struggling to afford child care   child care is such a big problem   [Applause]   we're gonna solve that problem that   means we need working mothers to be   fairly compensated for their work and   have access to affordable quality child   care for their kids what we're doing we   want higher pay better wages and a   growing economy for everyone these   solutions must update laws passed more   than a half a century ago when most   women who is still not in the labor   force most of them or even to us today   nearly two and three mothers with young   children have jobs for many families in   our country childcare is now the single   largest expense so would think that even   more so than houses yet very little   meaningful policy work has been done in   this area and my opponent has no   childcare plan she never will and if it   ever evolves into a plan it'll never get   done   anyway all talk no action   [Applause]   many Americans are just one crisis away   from disaster the sick kid a lost job a   damaged home there is no financial   security in our country especially   anymore but that will change under a   pro-family profile yet when you just   take a look   it's pro-family it's pro child it's pro   worker   these are the people we have to take   care of and this is what I'm going to be   outlining tonight before before going   any further I want everyone watching on   TV and there are a lot of people right   now to go to Donald J Trump comm to read   the full plan great detail the first   part of my child care plan allows for   every parent or family in America   including adoptive parents and foster   parent Guardians   to deduct their childcare expenses from   their income taxes   [Applause]   I see the women who I just met in the   front row are very happy about that   they will fully be able to deduct the   average cost of child care for their   state from birth through the age of 13   because of the way the benefit is   captain structured our plan will bring   relief to working and middle-class   families the deduction also applies to   elder care capped at $5,000 deduction   per year $5,000 deduction   importantly our policy also supports   mothers who choose to stay at home and   honors and recognizes their incredible   contributions to their families and to   our society   [Applause]   families where the stay-at-home parent   will be able to fully deduct the average   cost of child care from their taxes I   like in a while the Congress women like   to hear Wow makes your life a lot easier   right for low-income individuals who   have no net income tax liability we will   offer an expanded Earned Income Tax   Credit   that's a ITC in the form of a child care   we take working parents to get an   expanded EITC benefit that equals up to   half of their total payroll tax of major   relief for low-income parents low-income   parents have a tougher than anybody this   translates to as much as an extra $1,200   in EITC benefits for working families   next   our plan allows every parent in America   to open up a dependent care savings   account families can contribute up to   $2,000 a year to these accounts   completely tax-free   [Applause]   [Music]   she's very happy about it rock is very   happy about this crucially unlike the   flexible spending accounts that exist   today   these accounts will be available to all   Americans you won't have to depend on   your employer to provide them immediate   family and employers and this is like   right away can also contribute to a   dependent account each of which is   designed and designated for a specific   child including an unborn child the   money that is put into these accounts   can also be spent not only her child   care but also child enrichment   activities let's see we'll start with   that child that will be our first job   [Applause]   that's cute additionally the funds in   these accounts do not expire at the end   of the year they don't revert to   employers or to the Treasury   instead the funds roll over so that   while only $2,000 can be contributed   each year unspent sums can accumulate   and create substantial savings   tremendous savings actually these   savings can be used by parents to help   give their kids school choice and will   thus contribute to the school choice   reforms I outlined last week a lot of   good outlines last week on schools and   really popular I will tell you the funds   will remain in the account until the age   of 18   whatever still remains at that time can   be used to help offset the cost of   higher education for your child   [Applause]   for low-income individuals the federal   government will provide matching funds   if parents contribute $1,000 the federal   government will provide a $500 match to   help low-income families reach these   targets and save money we will put a box   on federal income tax forms allowing   these parents to have their Earned   Income Tax Credit funds directly   deposited into their dependent care   savings accounts pretty simple   these dependent care savings accounts   can also be set up to provide care for   elderly dependents we have many many   many many our plan also includes   much-needed regulatory reform to   incentivize private sector solutions the   new funds offered by our plan will   create a new market for innovative   childcare solutions but to make sure   these solutions are available especially   in low-income and rural communities we   must reduce regulations that favor large   institutional care facilities you know   what I'm talking about   so special interests got them there we   will allow the states to make the   decisions that are right for them in   this era of sharing economy we want   parents to be able to access lower-cost   competitive and innovative solutions at   the click of a button including services   like nanny sharing our plan would also   cover care provided by relatives and   grandparents our plan includes   incentives for more employers to offer   on-site childcare as well we want the   employers to get involved now they'll   start getting involved Bigley right   [Applause]   and you'll start liking your employer a   lot more that's one of the benefits this   can often be a good solution for many   working parents and can save them up to   30 minutes in commute time it's a lot   currently only 7% of employers provide   these services not very much our plan   will expand tax deductions for employers   allow companies to pool resources to   provide shared shared and just as I   think so important provide shared child   care services and remove needless   requirements that have prevented   employers from using the credit the   requirements are so owners that they   never get to use it even though in many   cases they would like to finally our   plan offers a crucial safety net for   working mothers whose employers do not   provide paid maternity leave this   solution well received strong bipartisan   support do you agree with it do you   think when you go to the other side   they'll be okay I'm hearing a little bit   we'll get them to be ok right and we'll   be completely self-financing I think you   will you'll have bipartisan support by   recapturing fraud and improper payments   and the unemployment insurance program   we can provide six weeks of paid   maternity leave to any mother with a   newborn child whose employer does not   provide the benefit   [Applause]   this retarded Ely will be paid straight   out of the unemployment insurance fund   and again the safety net will be   completely paid for through savings   within the program there are more   reforms and solutions in our child care   plan and you can review them all on the   website on Thursday I will outline my   full economic plan which is completely   paid for through economic growth and   proposed federal budget savings it's   going to be something special like this   country hasn't seen in many many decades   [Applause]   together our tax trade regulatory and   energy policies will add trillions and   trillions of dollars in new deficit   lowering growth these are the kinds of   solutions I want to bring to the White   House as your president it's time to   free ourselves from the baskets that   politicians try to put us into and   always have put us into and instead to   work together and I think you know what   I mean   [Applause]   did you now   [Applause]   thank you thank you   yeah I think you know what I'm talking   about well my opponents Landers you as   deplorable and irredeemable I call you   hard-working American patriots who love   your time   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   thank you no thank you   it's time to end the rule of special   interests and to begin the rule of the   American people it's what it's all about   gonna be a big change it's time to stop   fighting over the smallest words and to   start dreaming about the great   adventures that lie ahead for our   incredible country   [Applause]   it's time to start believing in America   again together I promise you together we   will make our country strong again we   will make our country prosperous again   we will make our country great again   greater than ever before thank you thank   you   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]

have a   warm warm spot in my heart I was an   important victory come november eighth   we're going to win this state and we're   going to win back the White House it's   about time we're going to win back   and we're going to bring back your jobs   which have been ripped out of our   country we're bringing back your jobs   we're going to cut your taxes massively   and you know people don't understand but   Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes   very substantial tax and crazy so people   don't understand we're going to   renegotiate our disastrous trade deals   we're going to protect our country from   radical Islamic terrorism   that one's not even close over the   weekend there were Islamic terrorist   attacks in Minnesota New York City and   in New Jersey these attacks were made   possible because of our extremely open   immigration system which fails to   properly vet and screen the individuals   or families coming into our country   attack after attack from 9-11 to San   Bernardino to Orlando we have seen how   failure to screen who is entering the   United States puts all of our citizens   in great danger so let me state this   very very clearly and as you know at   least most of you know I've been saying   this for a long time this didn't just   happen like yesterday immigration   security is national security   now I assume she'll be changing this but   you know what's been happening my   opponent has the most open borders   policy of anyone ever to seek the office   of presidency it's not even close as   Secretary of State she allowed thousands   of criminal aliens to be released into   our communities because their home   countries wouldn't take them back they   were too bad they didn't want them so we   took them now Obama wants to bring in as   of two days ago an additional one   hundred and ten thousand refugees and   Hilary wants I mean honestly honestly   it's hard to believe and hillary wants a   five hundred and fifty percent increase   in Syrian refugees altogether Hillary   Clinton's plan would bring in six   hundred and twenty thousand refugees in   her first term alone with no effective   way to screen or vet them her plan would   cause four hundred billion dollars in   terms of lifetime welfare and   entitlement costs this isn't just a   matter of terrorism but also a matter of   quality of life and many of you are just   starting off on this incredible journey   and it is about quality of life and it's   about safety it's about safety sorry   have to have a safe country we want to   make sure we are only admitting people   into our country who love our country my   highest duty as president is to protect   our citizens and to uphold the   Constitution of the United States I will   honor that duty to the fullest extent   every single day and I will never waver   in that sacred obligation it's just a   plain fact that our current immigration   system makes no real attempt to   determine the views of the people   entering our country we have no idea who   they are what they think since nine   eleven hundreds of immigrants and their   children have been implicated in   terrorism and terrorist related activity   within the United States now we learned   that another 858 immigrants it's just   the other day from dangerous countries   have slipped into our country and been   granted citizenship despite the fact   that they were supposed to be deported   they probably press the wrong button on   a computer so they were supposed to be   deported and they were given citizenship   welcome to America   so we're going to build a wall we're   gonna go we're gonna build we're going   to build the wall Mexico's gonna pay for   the wall one hundred percent   but the over 800 people really had   nothing to do with the wall you know   they had to do with a lot of other   things and it's a very very set can you   imagine we made them citizens and they   were getting ready for deportation so if   something was very wrong or they press   the wrong button at a computer but   either way can have it all together   there are nearly 1 million individuals   in the United States with deportation   orders who have not yet been removed in   the 20th century the United States   defeated fascism Nazism and communism   now we must defeat radical Islamic   terrorism   yet my opponent won't even say the words   radical Islamic terror in fact Hillary   Clinton talks tougher about my   supporters than she does about Islamic   terrorists she calls the patriotic   Americans who support our campaign many   of them cops and soldiers deplorable and   irredeemable has she ever talked that   way about radical Islam or about those   who oppose and murder women and gays   overseas no has Hillary Clinton ever   called people to support these practices   deplorable or irredeemable know in many   countries overseas non-believers face   the death penalty whether it's Hillary's   condemnation I mean where is it where is   her condemnation of these people where   is their condemnation of these countries   let's ask Hillary how many people who   subscribe to radical Islamic views and   support the oppression of non-believers   would you call deplorable were   irredeemable that's a terrible word that   hasn't been reported but that was a word   that you used are those words reserved   only for hardworking Americans that   truly truly support us and truly love   our country seems that way America can   never elect a president like Hillary   Clinton who apparently with her choice   of words thinks that the decent American   citizens are bigger threat than radical   Islam can't do this anyone who cannot   name our enemy is not fit to lead this   country remember   and if you can't name your enemy you   don't know what the problem is and if   you don't know what the problem is   you're never going to fix the problem   anyone who cannot condemn the hatred   oppression and violence of radical Islam   lacks the moral clarity to serve as our   president the commander-in-chief of this   nation must speak with moral clarity and   conviction our system of government is   the best in the world and as your   president I will defend our values and   speak out against those who assault our   values in any way shape or form right   it's also time to remember one very   important word accountability all this   disaster with Isis happened on Hillary   Clinton's watch happened with her her   bad judgment her bad decision-making her   policies in Iraq and Libya and Syria are   responsible for the rise of Isis her   attacks on me are all meant to deflect   from her record of unleashing this   monstrous evil upon us you ever notice   all she does is attack me constantly tak   a tak everyone says you should never   have your successful never run for   political office but that's the kind of   person you need hate to tell you that   that's what we need but they've always   said all my life all of my life I've   heard of you successful never run for   political office but it's time we have   to bring our country back we have to   make our country great again we have to   do something because it's not working   right now the way it is   her time turbo and it's you know this is   so true her timetable and withdrawal   from Iraq her push for regime change at   Libya and Syria her open border policies   these are the actions that unleashed the   ISIS disaster so she will say and do   anything to distract from that record of   total failure and let's see how much she   changes her policies over the next   couple of days because she's been for   open borders she's for people pouring in   from Syria she's from all of these   things I think it's getting very hard   for anybody that's rational or even sane   if you look at it I mean how can people   believe this way how can they do that   how can people believe this when they   see what's happening all over the world   look at Germany look at what happened to   merkel then the recent election look at   what's going on we have to use common   sense we have to be smart we have to be   tough we have to be vigilant her claim   that my opposition to radical Islamic   terrorism is a recruiting tool to what   how does that have to do with I'm being   tough why is that a recruiting I'm much   tougher than her on this problem is   horrible situation but she goes around   saying it's a recruiting tool you know   somebody gave her that from Madison   Avenue you know about it that's   advertising they gave her that from it   they said let's go to recruiting tool   but why because I'm tough it's a   recruiting tool it demonstrates a level   of ignorance about the terror threat   that really is disqualifying for a   person seeking the presidency when she   says my opposition to radical Islamic   terror provides aid and comfort to the   enemy we know that Hillary Clinton has   once again demonstrated that she's   really unfit for office   her comments are not only reckless but   beneath the dignity of the office that   she seeks Isis is torturing murdering   executing and exterminating people in a   campaign of genocide and what is Hillary   Clinton suggesting what is she   suggesting you know what you see let's   let more people come in that we should   censor our vocabulary so as not to upset   these butchers I have news for Hillary   refusing to call out radical Islam will   not lessen the danger it will only   increase and embolden the danger just   like we have seen during her disastrous   and fail term as Secretary of State it   emboldened   just like Iran is emboldened you look at   Iran their own Bolton they made this   deal and instead of becoming our friend   it looks to me like it's gotten worse   the rise of Isis is Hillary Clinton's   foreign policy legacy one of them many   others that are not good Secretary   Clinton has helped to toppled regimes   displace millions and then open the door   to Isis potentially to enter this   country now you think of this it's a   disaster so how is this policy a smart   policy Clinton's decisions overseas have   left us with the threat we face today   and her immigration policies will invite   this threat on to our shores as soon as   yours as sure as you are there in front   of me standing watching that's going to   happen right onto our shores it's   happening we must stop the massive   inflow of refugees which Hillary Clinton   is trying to drastically increase now   she may change your mind because this is   what's been happening for a long time   but it's getting harder and harder   because how are you electable when you   have policies like that we should   temporarily suspend immigration entirely   from regions where safe and adequate   screening and I mean extreme vetting   cannot occur   right pew polling shows that in many of   the countries from which we drew large   numbers of immigrants extreme views   about religion such as the death penalty   for those who leave the faith are   commonplace the death penalty it's the   job and really of government to admit   those and only those who we expect to   succeed in to flourish here and become   part of our incredible country and home   [Applause]   Hillary Clinton disagrees with his   common sense rule and it's one more   reason why she will not win the election   on november eighth it's time to break   with the corruption the bad judgment and   the failures of the past it's time to   have a new American future we are going   to change our immigration system to   reflect American values we're going to   stop the policy of regime change   overseas and instead focus on working   with our allies on a military campaign   to utterly destroy Isis and defeat   Islamic terrorism this will not only   require military warfare but also   financial warfare cyber warfare an   ideological warfare but to win this   struggle we need to be strong at home   we're going to rebuild our country our   infrastructure is a disaster our country   is a mess with 20 trillion dollars in   debt thank you for 20 trillion dollars   at the center of the effort will be in   fact the rebuilding of our inner cities   nearly four and ten african-american   children live in poverty including forty   five percent of african-american   children under the age of six think of   them fifty-eight percent of   african-american youth are not working   violent crime rose in America's 50   largest cities last year it went through   the roof homicides are up nearly fifty   percent in Washington DC and more than   sixty percent in Baltimore more than   3,000 people have been shot in Chicago   since January think of it since ya nour   three thousand people that's like worse   than the war-torn nations that you   that's worse than Afghanistan the   schools are failing the jobs are leaving   and millions are trapped in poverty so   to the african-american community I say   vote for Donald Trump I will fix it I   will fix it   I will bring back your jobs I will fix   your schools and I will fight for your   safety you'll be safe it's time for new   civil rights agendas and one that   promises safe communities great   education and a good paying job now I   say this and I say this all the time   what do you have to lose your education   is broken your communities are unsafe   there are no jobs it's been run by   Democrats for sometimes up to a hundred   years unbroken what do you have to lose   I will fix it my whole life so true so   true they've really let you down they   ask for your vote you give me a vote   year after year you give me a vote then   in the presidential at least and and   every other one but in the presidential   they say hey see you man see in four   years that's what they do they say see   in four years we'll be back and then   they come back and they promised your   things and nothing happens and you vote   so it's time to change what do you have   to lose I will fix it remember that my   whole life   has been about creating jobs thousands   and thousands of jobs Hillary Clinton   has spent her career destroying jobs   just look at upstate New York and her   terrible trade deals Hillary supported   NAFTA she supported China's entrance   into the word World Trade Organization   disaster and she supported the   job-killing deal with South Korea that   helped make them a fortune and us we   lost jobs we lost factory we lost month   the South Korean deal was supposed to   create 70,000 jobs instead we lost a   hundred thousand jobs and our trade   deficit with South Korea has more than   doubled these are the deals we make next   Hillary Clinton wants to approve the   trans-pacific partnership that deal will   be a disaster for North Carolina for   every state your state your state has   lost more than four and ten   manufacturing jobs since NAFTA signed by   her husband I'm going to renegotiate   this disastrous deal and if we don't get   the deal we want we'll walk away and   we'll start all over again   our trade deficit with the world is   nearly 800 billion dollars a year think   of that 800 billion dollars you almost   say who's negotiating these deals we   have a trade deficit worldwide of almost   800 billion this is really the economic   legacy of Hillary Clinton now four more   years of obama four more years of   clinton you can't do it you can't do it   people aren't going to take it but we're   going to turn it all around my economic   agenda can be summed up in three very   beautiful words jobs jobs jobs   I'm going to get rid of massive   absolutely massive amounts of   unnecessary regulations and your tax   cuts are going to be so happy you're   going to be so happy when you bring all   that money home big tax code she'll   raise taxes i'm lowering taxes that's a   big difference I'm going to repeal and   i'm going to replace Obamacare   which has turned out to be an economic   disaster for family I'm going to create   American energy independence I'm going   to make our government lean responsible   and efficient I'm going to fix our   terrible trade deals and defend the   American worker I'm going to rebuild our   depleted military and take care of our   great veterans and I'm going to appoint   justices to the Supreme Court who will   follow the Constitution of the United   States we will rebuild our roads our   bridges or tunnels highways airports   schools and hospitals American cars will   travel the roads American planes will   soar the skies and American ships will   again patrol the Seas and it's about   time American steel will send news look   you know all about skyscrapers right   anybody going to be an architect anybody   going to be a developer developer any   developers any young develop a 12 he's   already a developer American steel will   send those new skyscrapers into the   clouds American hands will rebuild this   nation an American energy harvested from   American sources will power our nation   American workers will be hired to do the   job   we will put new American steel into the   spine of this country I will fight for   every neglected part of our nation every   single part of this great nation and I   will fight to bring us together as one   American people imagine what our country   could accomplish if we started working   together as one people under one God   saluting one flag   [Applause]   it's time to break with the bitter   failures of the past and to embrace a   new inclusive prosperity and the   American future because that's what it's   going to be new factories are going to   come rushing in they're going to come   rushing rushing in you wait till you see   what happens we will incentivize people   to stay and they will be decentralized   if they leave our country they're not   going to just come out fire all our   people build product outside of the   country and sell it into our country so   easily it's going to be a whole   different ballgame and now they'll say   you know what I think we're not leaving   that's what's going to happen once more   we will have a government of By and For   the People   we will make America wealthy again and   save your social security which you   people are a long ways away we will make   America strong again we will make   America safe again and we will make   America great again god bless you god   bless you and thank you thank you get   out and vote november eight get out and   vote and october 20th thank

bsMMj62H0L4~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160928~Full Event: Donald Trump Rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa (9/28/2016) Trump Council Bluffs Speech~29940.0~4.6868686676~730.0~62.0~   according to mrs. Clinton some very   large percentage 25 or 50 percent of you   are deplorable your deplorable I'm   coming and joining you be about 1 i'm   proud to be called deplorable by hillary   clinton i'm also irredeemable you know   with the Danes I'm not gonna vote for   her gonna vote for change Donald Trump   is going to give you many of the reasons   why I'm going to tell you about one that   has been the source of discussion and   distortion throughout this campaign   during the debate the other night mrs.   Clinton made the ridiculous assertion   that somehow Donald Trump is friendly   with Vladimir Putin of Russia first of   all he's never met him and he doesn't   know him and he isn't fond of dictators   and people like that but here's the   reality and here's the difference it's   Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama they   gave Vladimir Putin the first sign that   we will week and I know something about   murderers and bullies and dictators I   prot i prosecuted the commission of the   Mafia i prosecuted Colombian drug cartel   members and put them in jail   I've had several organizations put out   contracts to kill me in fact in one case   the Mafia voted 3-2 to not to kill me   it's one of the few elections I want so   I know something about people like that   if you cave in to them they take   advantage of you almost as soon as Obama   came into office Hillary Clinton reset   the relationship with Russia oh that   really work well since then they've gone   into Crimea eastern Ukraine and then   they moved in and took over the power   vacuum we left open for them in Syria   because President Obama drew 12 lines of   the sand and said if you use chemical   weapons I'm going to do something and   then he did and Obama didn't and then he   did and Obama didn't and eventually that   red line started to turn orange and pink   and then there was no line at all except   the one that that gentleman just pointed   out it's called a yellow line and mr.   Putin came to a determination these   people are weak I can push them around   they don't stand up for their country   and then President Obama is now   proceeding and mrs. Clinton agrees with   decimating our military now here's the   difference here's the difference with   Donald Trump yes he'll negotiate with   Putin the way my former boss Ronald   Reagan negotiated with Gorbachev   he'll negotiate from something they know   nothing about strength a a military a   military in which we have 200 I'm sorry   four hundred and fifty thousand soldiers   instead of the 420 they want us to take   down to 350 ships a lot more than they   want 1,200 fighters 35 battalions of   Marines up from 28 a refurbished special   forces had modernized weapons we're   going to invest in defense and don't   tell me how we can pay for it what got   us out of the last of depression defense   spending defense spending put you all   the work it means more jobs it means a   revitalized America and it means when   Donald Trump negotiates from America   prudent is going to be faced with a   person that he respects not likes but   respects because this man will have the   strongest military in the history of the   world behind him and Putin can't match   that   I've known Donald Trump for 28 years and   if I had to go and pick somebody to   negotiate for my country against Putin I   would not pick every negotiation she got   nothing back in return I would pick the   a-number-one negotiated we have in this   country Donald J Trump the next   president of the United   [Applause]   do you stand   thank you very much Wow we flew in you   know we only started this about 12 hours   ago so to have this crowd packed this is   beautiful thank you thank you so I   understand that we have a reuters poll   where we're 10 points up we have another   poll where we're eight points up   november eighth is going to be an   amazing it's going to be an amazing day   that will be where we take the White   House back and it starts right here   I also a special group of my friends are   here you know when we came to Iowa and   we got all the tremendous support from   the evangelicals and from everybody and   everybody at one point was a little bit   remember I brought my Bible up remember   that and they were all sort of saying   like well do you think Trump will do   well with evangelicals boy did I do well   with evangelicals right and that carried   on and we went down to South Carolina we   went to North Carolina mean who was   amazing we had an amazing period and   it's been great but you know we have our   Christian conservatives for Trump today   and they're in the room let's go that's   what we want that's beautiful see that   in fact they put this we see that right   here Christian conserve raise your hand   Christian conservatives everybody   raise your hand if you're not a   Christian conservative I want to see   this right that's out as a couple pay   plus our I think we'll keep them right   to we keep him in the room yes I think   so so I want to thank you and before we   begin I have a special friend right here   who lost her incredible daughter to an   illegal immigrant and she was in the   back and I said you have to come   Michelle please come up Michelle come up   this is a special woman an amazing an   amazing woman I just wanted to say thank   you everybody for turning out for mr.

daughter after he showed up at the   borders then after he killed my daughter   they released him again now where is he   nobody knows Donald Trump is the only   person that cared about us when no one   else could and would if Hillary wins how   many more girls are going to die how   many more women will die at the hands of   their policies thank you thank you   [Applause]   her daughter was an amazing young woman   first in her class just amazing in every   way so I just want to say thank you to   the whole route family credible family   alright so we are going to take on   special interests a lobbyist and the   corrupt corporate media that have rigged   the system against every single American   I've been reading stories over the last   couple of days that are so inaccurate   and so dishonest I have never seen   anything like it in my life and I'm   willing to take it on because and I   didn't need it believe me I didn't need   have a great company I built this great   company and somebody said you know he   could be at a point where he's enjoying   the fruits of his labor in here i am   working harder than ever before i'm like   a lot of people in the different rooms   in the different stadiums where true   where were 18 years ago their wages in   real wages were higher than they are   today they had one job now they have two   jobs they're working much harder much   harder than making much less money and   that's what's happened in our country   and the only thing I can say is I'm also   working harder okay so well working   harder together we're working a lot   harder together and I'm spending a lot   of money in my campaign I'm spending   tremendous tens and tens and tens of   millions of dollars and I like it   because you know what we're not going to   be controlled we're not going to be   controlled so important   we're not going to be controlled we're   going to we're going to take our country   back and it's going to be a beautiful   thing this is a movement we have a   movement going on like I think they've   never seen before and everybody's   talking about it the big thing is in   november eighth we have to get out there   folks otherwise this movement will be   wonderful to read about some day but you   know what it won't mean a damn thing   okay won't mean to me won't mean a damn   thing we're going to create new   government that serves you your family   in your country lower taxes by a lot   less regulation more affordable   childcare fair trade deals secure   borders thriving family farms millions   and millions of new jobs we're going to   end the clinton corruption total collide   horrible horrible what's going on to   this country is horrible and restore   dignity and honesty to government   service Hillary Clinton is an insider   fighting for her donors and her insiders   mostly fighting for herself I am an   outsider fighting for you were fighting   together fighting   everything you need to know about   Hillary Clinton can be understood with   this simple phrase follow the money and   believe me that's what's happened in her   campaign for president Hillary Clinton   has received 100 million dollars in   contributions from wall street and the   hedge funds she received 4.1 million   dollars in speaking fees from financial   firms I'd like to see what she said   where are the papers Bernie Bernie was   asking for the papers but Bernie gave up   the same groups paying bill and hillary   for their speeches were lobbying the   federal government 22 groups paying bill   clinton for speeches lobbied the state   department while Hilary was Secretary of   State and don't forget that Clinton   contributors who were appointed to   advisory boards by the Secretary Clinton   or all the favors and access was granted   and guess what they wrote checks the   favors were granted and all of these   people or at least a lot of them wrote   checks she even gave up twenty percent   of uranium you know what happens with   uranium don't you and who controls that   twenty percent Russia Russia Russia she   disgraced the office of Secretary of   State by putting it up for sale and if   she ever got the chance she would put   the Oval Office up for sale too and   nobody has any doubt about it and we   can't let that happen that's why you   have to go out and vote a november   eighth and early voting in Iowa starts   tomorrow get out don't take a chance   don't take your chance   [Applause]   do not take a chance she deleted and   bleached 33 thousand emails nobody ever   heard of the bleaching nobody ever heard   of it and they don't use it's a very   expensive process people don't use it   but she used it and nobody understands   how she can get a congressional subpoena   she gets the subpoena this didn't happen   before the subpoena she gets the   subpoena and she then goes out and she   deletes 33,000 emails you know if   somebody Sue's you and they want your   records and you do that as a private   citizen it's you know where you go she   gets a congressional subpoena and I'm so   disappointed with the people in   Washington for allowing her to get away   with this I'm so disappointed and that   means on both sides by the way I am so   disappointed when they say there's   nothing they can do there's nothing they   can do   she gets rid of 13 phones how many   people have gotten rid of 13 phones and   how many people get one hand what   business are you in what's your business   I think he was just a wise guy that's   something but she destroyed a number of   them with a hammer how many people have   destroyed an iphone or a phone with a   hammer anybody in the room huh a couple   of hands go up I don't know if they're   kidding i think they're kidding but who   knows her staffers taking the Fifth   Amendment how about that and her   ringleaders getting immunity is down she   has people taking the fifth amendment   four people plus the guy who illegally   did the server you know he put in the   illegal server so there are five people   taking the fifth amendment like you see   on the mob right you see the mob takes   of it if you're innocent why you taking   the fifth amendment and then they read a   whole list of charges she's guilty on   every one of them and then what do they   say but that's okay and yet other people   that have done two percent of what she   did their lives have been destroyed you   tell me you tell me what's going on with   our country what's going on with our   government foreign enemies with easy   access to hacker server lies to Congress   under oath about turning over her   work-related emails which are largely   destroyed although I have a feeling they   could get emails you know I've always   heard you really can't destroy your   meals I don't think they tried too hard   to get them do you does anybody think   I don't think they tried too hard the   Clintons have perfected the politics of   profit but more importantly when you   look at what's happening I think it has   more to do with other things large   corporations who support terrible trade   deals and offshore jobs and they're   donating to the Clintons when you look   at some of the deals that we all have to   suffer with and you look at the deals   that are made a lot of those deals it's   not because the politicians are so   stupid on some cases they are seriously   but not all probably in most they aren't   friend of mine said to me how is it   possible that such and such a deal was   made and then you look at who's making   contributions to the campaign and you   see why the deal is made okay it's very   sad when you look at and what does it   mean it means our jobs are fleeing our   country our companies that employ the   people are leaving from Mexico and other   places China can devalue their currency   and do whatever they want The Wall   Street investors who have rigged the   regulations against the middle class   they're donating to Hillary Clinton   they're certainly not donating to me the   wealthy donors who want to shut down   American energy they're donating to   Hillary Clinton and by the way ethanol   we like ethanol right you like afternoon   special interests who want open borders   are donating to Hillary Clinton and you   have your problems here with open   borders and I've been hearing a lot   about open borders even hear you don't   think of this part of the world for open   borders you have your problems a lot of   people are telling me that's what   Hillary Clinton is pushing I will build   a wall we will build that wall   we're going to build a wall and Mexico   is going to pay for the wall believe me   Hunter pisser Mexico is doing very well   thanks to the United States Mexico is   very happy with the United States   Mexico's leaders are so much smarter   than our latest so Hillary Clinton's   pushing for a five hundred and fifty   percent increase in Syrian refugees   coming into our country it's actually   unbelievable I have to be you know I   said up here and I stand up here and I   do all of these speeches and discussions   and I read all I read and I see all I   see and you hear a thing like that five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   fact i used to say five hundred percent   and the president Trump is wrong so I   figured well I figured its three four   five hundred percent lower they said he   was wrong it's actually a five hundred   and fifty percent increase in other   words she's allowing more they even   correct you on the upside that's the   first time that ever happened she and   her financial backers will say anything   to do anything they lie about anything   to keep their grip and power to keep   their control over the country the   American people have had it with corrupt   Clinton ways they've had it   they're tired of the lies they're tired   of trivial politics they're tired of   being talked down to look down upon and   treated like second-class citizens smart   people not being treated right how many   more Clinton scandals can this country   take one after another after another you   know the story folks you've seen it for   years and years and we can't take   another four years of Barack Obama and   we can't take it out of the four years   of crooked Hillary Clinton you can't do   it they're the suited pass we're gonna   have a bright future we're going to make   America great again we're going to make   America greater than ever before we can   do that but if we don't win this   election it'll never ever happen I tell   you what we're never going to have   another shot this is it the tables will   be turned and it'll be too late well our   campaign outlines big changes and bold   solutions to make your life better the   Clinton campaign focuses only in small   and petty distractions never in American   history have so many serious challenges   been met with so unserious a campaign as   the campaign of Hillary Clinton and I'll   tell you what you know we had to debate   the other night and every single online   poll had we winning by sometimes a   landslide and then you go on television   and these are Time magazine Drudge   phenomenal man Drudge big big groups I   mean other than I'm on the cover of Time   magazine a lot but they they're no   friends of mine believe me and I'm   winning by massive margins in many cases   and one was eighty percent to twenty   percent but I'm winning all of these   polls how many were there seven or eight   or nine hundreds of thousands of votes   and then I have to sit back and you have   to sit back and hear how those polls   don't mean anything   but when they pull 300 people that means   a lot right and so we want every single   online poll hundreds and hundreds of   thousands of voters and then you sit   back and you hear how she did so well in   the debate I don't think she did well in   the debate at all I don't think she said   well at all and I just walked in and I   saw some of the great people that   represent your state and they said wow   you did so great in the debate and we   understand it we understand it and we'll   see as the poll start coming out the   other polls having to do with the States   but I hear we're doing very well we're   leading in Ohio we're leading in Florida   we're leading in North Carolina here   we're doing very well and they are not   happy back there those people back there   with the cameras they are not happy   we are not happy   now they're very dishonest this will be   the year the American people say enough   is enough   it's time for real change a new foreign   policy a new economic policy and new   immigration policy and a new trade   policy Hillary Clinton a vessel for   special interests trying to strip this   country of its wealth its jobs at its   status as a sovereign nation she's a   globalist who has made a career of   taking jobs from this country and giving   them so stupidly and so sadly to other   countries you've been seeing it for   years and years and years it's going to   stop it's no longer going to be a one   lane highway going out of our country   with our jobs at our money still longer   benefit I'm not running to be President   of the world I'm running to be President   of the United States and we're going to   protect your wrinkles   from now on it's going to be America   first have you out there it's gonna be   great but we gonna have a good time and   you have a good time when you love what   you're doing I always tell people when   they ask me for advice pick something   you love we love our country we love   what we're doing it's inconvenient at   this time of the day for many of you to   be here but you here and we love you we   love you too but we love our country and   that's why we're doing it you have   wondered why is it that all things the   American people want never seemed to   happen it never seems to happen simple   things we want to create jobs they go to   China they go all over the place China   makes our product China cheats us you   know when we talk free trade these are   stupid people when we talk free trade   it's supposed to be free trade so China   sense its product in no tax please come   in they dump steel they heard our steel   workers they do so many different things   you try selling into China I have many   friends that are manufacturers it's   impossible for them to do business in   China and then sometimes generously all   right come build a plant but they don't   even want that they want their people to   build the plant they don't even want   that to one way street and you know   where the streets going to lead you know   it you know the result I said the other   day I said we're in a big bubble the   only thing we have going is a phony Wall   Street because the interest rates are so   low because the Fed is controlled by the   politicians never happened before why   can't we have the schools that we want   and the borders that we want and the   security that we want   why can't we have policies that support   small businesses or family farms or the   miners and the steelworkers why can't   wait and by the way for the family   farmers Hillary Clinton's plan proposes   an estate tax of sixty-five percent   sixty-five percent so you can have a   state tax of up to sixty-five percent   lot's of luck having your kids hold on   to your farms not going to happen the   answer is simple because the financial   interests who control our politics and   our media don't want these changes to   happen these special interests they   control and they have total control over   Hillary Clinton they give her so much   money boy she's got a lot of money I   have had more commercials I am I just   want to see a regular ivory snow   commercial on diet she has got so much   and somebody said she's going to out   commercial us 50 to 1 don't think of it   is that possible 51 think of it now   she's spending hundreds of millions of   dollars and I think we're leading I   don't know where the tide are leading   right   which tells you how bad she is honestly   I truly believe this Hillary Clinton is   incompetent she's incompetent I really   believe this you know told somebody that   they said no that's not possible she   failed her bar exam in Washington DC and   I said I'm not that surprised actually   but I'm telling you she's incompetent   and she's certainly incompetent for you   that I can tell you that I know for sure   she's their chosen representative you   can disregard everything she said and   just remember this raise follow the   money she's there for one reason and   that's to protect her donors and special   interest you look at a career she's been   there and I brought this up the other   night at the debate first time really   she's been there for 30 years almost and   she's never done anything for you and   your family now she wants to do this she   wants to fight Isis Isis wouldn't be   there of her and Barack Obama ended the   war the way it was supposed to be ended   and didn't create the big vacuum   and I'd bet if he had it to do over   again knowing what he knows he would   have never picked her a secretary of   state Becky she's failed at everything   she's failed in Iraq she's failed in   Libya she's failed in Syria she's failed   in Iran how about the Iran deal how   about that that was the beginning of   that deal don't forget that was her   genius that got that one that's one of   the great catera how about 400 million   in cash going to these guys and then   they made a mistake right they made a   mistake it wasn't for a hundred I said   oh good maybe it was like 1,000,000 now   what 1.7 billion it wasn't 400 it was   1.7 billion in cash do you know what   that looks like that would fill up the   whole corner of this room up halfway to   the ceiling cash cash and one of the   things that Obama or somebody said well   we couldn't open up normal check-in   relations so we had to give it to him   cash where did these people come from   where do they come from chief elder on   Russia on China and on North Korea she   failed in upstate New York you know when   she ran for the Senate upstate New York   is it's a disaster what's happened up   there are jobs have all flown to Mexico   our companies have all left and they've   gone not all but massive massive numbers   have gone to Mexico in other countries   and what he was running for the Senate I   remembered so much it sounded so   wonderful we are going to create 200,000   new jobs in upstate New York didn't   happen because once the election was   over she went to Washington she named a   road she named a post off she passed   three bills there were nothing bills   three namings that's all she did did   nothing she did nothing and what   happened in upstate New York is a   disaster you have to see it now that's   why I one in the primers New York in a   massive landslide in a landslide because   people are tired of what's going on in   our country and they're tired of what's   going on in politic   so I really believe that you take a look   and I said I think that we're going to   have a turn out like you've never seen   before she failed the inner cities she's   failed women and children I've created   thousands of jobs for women in this   country women of incredible talent   Hillary Clinton has been a Washington   for many many years and now 70 million   America think of this 70 million   American women and children are in   poverty or the brink of poverty in our   country this is in the United States of   America and she's been a disaster on the   borders let him in let him in Hillary   Clinton supports sanctuary cities which   is basically sanctuary for some very   tough paper where was the sanctuary for   Americans like Sarah root the beautiful   daughter of mrs. root who you just met   the only people Hillary Clinton has ever   really delivered for our her special   interests and her donors her single   greatest achievement maybe getting away   with her massive email scandal and her   criminal cover-up I think it's her   greatest achievement   our campaign is taking on big business   and big media and big donors we're   taking them on for you we're going to   see maybe we'll do it and maybe we won't   but if we win you're going to be so   happy and so proud and you'll have the   future for you and your children and   your grandchildren that you want because   if we don't make that turn now including   the appointment of Supreme Court   justices this country is in big big   trouble   an even senator Ted Cruz endorsed me the   other day and I know the people of Iowa   like Ted Cruz but he endorsed us the   other day and I thought that was very   good that includes and we have to   include this we have to keep your   family's safe new FBI statistics show   that homicide rose fifteen percent last   year in America's large cities and that   it's the largest single year increase in   45 years you don't hear this stuff you   only hear it from Trump but let me tell   you you'll also hear positive for Trump   because we're going to turn things   around somebody said gee whiz it's not a   very optimistic message and somebody   else said actually it's very optimistic   because we explained the problem and   then we fix it like you have to know the   problem like Obama and Hillary Clinton   they don't want to say radical Islamic   terrorism I don't want to talk about it   and if you're not going to explain the   problem you're not going to fix it more   than 3,000 people listen to this have   been shot in Chicago since January think   of it it's hard to believe from Iowa   right 3,000 people have been shot since   January not since like 30 years ago   since January sixty percent of murder   victims under the age of 22 in this   country are african-american forty five   percent of african-american children   under the age of six a living in poverty   I will never back down from fighting to   save American lives we can't okay   I will never back down from fighting to   create safety and wealth for our inner   cities my economic agenda can be summed   up in three very beautiful words you   know what they are jobs jobs jobs we   will cut your taxes massively and by the   way she has a major tax increase reduce   regulations including to our farmers our   farmers are getting absolutely destroyed   with regulating negotiate great trade   deals instead of the horrible deals that   we have to live under right now like   NAFTA signed by Bill clever unleash   American energy and we are going to   repeal and replace Obamacare   we're going to protect the renewable   fuel standard and corn based ethanol   we're also going to end common core and   offer school choice to every   disadvantaged child including every poor   Hispanic and african-american child in   America the people getting rich off the   rig system are the people throwing their   money at Hillary Clinton remember follow   the money our campaign is about breaking   up the special interest monopoly in   Washington DC we're trying to disrupt   the collusion between the wealthy donors   the large corporations and the media   executives they're all part of the same   political establishment they go to the   same restaurants they attend the same   conferences to have the same friends and   connections and some of them even like   me I'll be honest with you but that   doesn't matter and they not along when   Hillary Clinton slanders you as   deplorable and as irredeemable your   irredeemable they said now I don't think   so people don't know how great you are   people don't know how smart you are   these are the smart people these are the   smart people these are really the smart   people and they never like to say it but   I say it and i'm a smart person these   are the smart we have the smartest   people they have the smallest   and they know it and some say it but   they hate to say it but we have the   smartest people government will start   working again fixing things is what I do   just look at my projects in New York and   around the world where I revitalize   neighborhoods and lifted up skylines and   I'd like to say that but this is the   kind of president we need it's not that   I want to say it an article that   appeared recently in the New York Post   was called how Donald Trump helped save   New York City the article said quote   Trump waded into a landscape of empty   Fifth Avenue sufferance the Dust Bowl   mugging ground that was central park at   a wall street area seemingly on its last   legs as companies moved out of New York   City Trump almost by will wrote to the   rescue hate to read this to you I'm   embarrassed expressing rare faith in the   future he was instrumental in   kick-starting the regeneration of   neighborhoods and landmarks almost given   up for dead in fact I had our great   mayor mayor Giuliani he knows rudinos   and he did a fantastic job that's what I   want to do for our country I want to go   into the neglected neighborhoods and the   great neighborhoods in all neighborhoods   I want to fix the failing schools the   Forgotten stretches of this nation I   want to unlock their potential for all   of our people together we can accomplish   anything we want but that means you need   to show up and vote in november eight   that it means you need to start voting a   me   Italy don't forget early voting you have   to knock on doors you have to pick up   that phone you have to get everybody if   you have somebody that says I'm sorry   Harold I can't make it today I'm so so   sick I don't think I'll be able to get   out of bed you look at that person you   say get out of bed you have no choice   you have to campaign on the streets   spread the love that we have in this   room to all of the people in your state   and in your country to beat the system   remember I was the one long time ago   when I was winning states and I wasn't   getting delegates remember and i would   say what's going on remember I went to   Louisiana and I wasn't expected to win   the evangelicals were great there too   and I went down and I said let's give it   one shot and I gave it a speech at a   massive airplane hangar we had   unbelievable thousands and thousands of   people and I left that was on a Friday   night the election was on a Saturday and   I said this doesn't look like the crowd   of a second place a third-place finisher   by that time I think they were down from   17 to about 12 people and I one big   Saturday night i won big and then I'm   looking at delicates and I said wait a   minute how come I have fewer delegates   than people that I beat and they said my   people they got so used to well sir   that's the way the system is I said   women something wrong with the system   and that's what I said the system's   rigged and Bernie Sanders had the rig   delegates and Bernie Sanders had the   rigged DNC the rig do you remember   Deborah Wasserman Schultz I don't know   how Bernie Sanders can be on the side of   Hillary Clinton when the DNC the   Democratic National Committee run by   Hillary Clinton's person Deborah   Wasserman Schultz what they did   to Bernie Sanders was unbelievable and   now she's supporting he's supporting her   you know what I said although I think a   lot of the Bernie Sanders people are   coming to us because I'm much better and   trade than Bernie Sanders even was and   he was ok but he's supporting her and   you know Bernie Sanders could have gone   down in the record books as being a   great great man but when he made that   deal it was over now he goes and he has   crowds of a hundred people nobody wants   to watch him nobody wants to listen not   that they dislike him but he doesn't   draw anybody he doesn't draw anybody and   it's a whole different thing had he not   made that deal he would have been   legendary but once he made that deal and   then she picks a vice president who is   sort of the opposite of Bernie Sanders   didn't even pay him the respect i mean   you know one of those things and came   when he was governor of virginia in the   first week he approved a tax increase a   four billion dollars in his first week   in office and he wasn't popular in   virginia they didn't like him in   virginia he won very close race and i   said to myself you know when she picked   him i said oh boy I hope we're not going   to lose Virginia now and we're doing   great in Virginia because nobody likes   Cain he approved a four billion dollar   tax increase in his first week but we do   like Mike Pence that I can tell you that   I can   Triple A rating Indiana triple a rating   we're going to have a triple-a rated   country to let me tell you that we are   going to have a country that in so many   ways is going to be Triple A we can do   it but mike has been a fantastic person

Cd7PktjV5Ws~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161013~Full Event: Donald Trump Rally in West Palm Beach, Florida (10/13/2016) Trump Live Florida Speech~58475.0~4.70764112473~1395.0~110.0~   [Music]   water through thank you thank you very   much   thank you folks   [Applause]   thank you folks it's great to be right   here in Florida which we love in 26 days   we are going to win this great grape   stay and we are going to win the White   House   our movement is about replacing a failed   and corrupt and when I say corrupt I'm   talking about totally corrupt political   establishment with a new government   controlled by you the American people   there is nothing the political   establishment will not do no lie that   they won't tell to hold their prestige   and power at your expense and that's   what's been happening the Washington   establishment and the financial and   media corporations that fund it exists   for only one reason to protect and   enrich itself the establishment has   trillions of dollars at stake in this   election as an example just one single   trade deal they'd like to pass involves   trillions of dollars controlled by many   countries corporations and lobbyists for   those who control the levers of power in   Washington and for the global special   interest they partner with these people   that don't have your good in mind our   campaign represents a true existential   threat like they haven't seen before   this is not simply another four-year   election this is a crossroads in the   history of our civilization that will   determine whether or not we the people   reclaim control over our government to   political establishment that is trying   to stop us is the same group responsible   for our disastrous trade deals massive   illegal immigration and economic and   foreign policies that have bled our   country dry   [Applause]   the political establishment has brought   about the destruction of our factories   and our jobs as they flee to Mexico   China and other countries all around the   world our just announced job numbers are   anemic our gross domestic product or GDP   is barely above one percent and going   down workers in the United States are   making less than they were almost 20   years ago and yet they are working   harder but so am i working harder   thought I could try   it's a global power structure that is   responsible for the economic decisions   that have robbed our working class   stripped our country of its well and put   that money into the pockets of a handful   of large corporations and political   entities just look at what this corrupt   establishment has done to our cities   like Detroit Flint Michigan and rural   towns in Pennsylvania Ohio North   Carolina and all across our country take   a look at what's going on they've   stripped away these towns bear and   raided the wealth for themselves and   taking our jobs away out of our country   never to return unless I'm elected   president   the Clinton machine is at the center of   this power structure we've seen this   firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in   which Hillary Clinton meets in secret   with international banks to plot the   destruction of us sovereignty in order   to enrich these global financial powers   her special interest friends and her   donors   so true   [Applause]   honestly she should be locked up sugar   on top   and likewise the emails show that the   Clinton machine is so closely and   irrevocably tied to the media   organizations that she that she listened   to this is given the questions and   answers in advance of her debate   performance with Bernie Sanders   Hillary Clinton is also given approval   and veto power over quotes written about   her in the New York Times they   definitely do not do that to me that and   the email show the reporters collaborate   and conspire directly with the Clinton   campaign on helping her win the election   all over with their control over our   government at stake with trillions of   dollars on the line the Clinton machine   is determined to achieve the destruction   of our campaign not going to happen   which has now become a great great   movement the likes of which our country   has never seen before never ever   [Applause]   they've never seen a movement like this   in our country before yesterday in   Florida massive crowds people lined up   outside of big arenas not able to get in   never happened before it's one of the   great phenomenas one of the great   political phenomenon the most powerful   weapon deployed by the Clintons is the   corporate media the press let's be clear   on one thing the corporate media in our   country is no longer involved in   journalism they're a political special   interest no different than any lobbyist   or other financial entity with a total   political agenda and the agenda is not   for you it's for themselves   and air agenda is to elect crooked   Hillary Clinton at any cost at any price   no matter how many lives they destroy   for them it's war and for them nothing   at all is out of bounds this is a   struggle for the survival of our nation   believe me and this will be our last   chance to save it on november eighth   remember that   this election will determine whether we   are a free nation or whether we have   only the illusion of democracy but are   in fact controlled by a small handful of   global special interests rigging the   system in our system is rigged this is   reality you know it they know it I know   it and pretty much the whole world knows   it the establishment and their media   neighbors will control over this nation   through means that are very well known   anyone who challenges their control is   deep   [Applause]   [Applause]   this is well documented and the   establishment that protects them has   engaged in a massive cover-up of   widespread criminal activity at the   State Department and the Clinton   Foundation in order to keep the Clintons   in power never in history have we seen   such a cover-up as this one that   includes the total destruction of 33,000   emails 13 iPhones some by hammer laptops   missing boxes of evidence and many many   other things people who are capable of   such crimes against our nation are   capable of anything and so now we   address the slander and libel that was   just last night thrown at me by the   Clinton machine and the New York Times   and other media outlets as part of a   concerted coordinated and vicious attack   it's not coincidence that these attacks   come at the exact same moment and all   together at the same time as WikiLeaks   releases documents exposing the massive   international corruption of the Clinton   machine including 2,000 more emails just   this morning   [Applause]   these vicious claims about me of   inappropriate conduct with women are   totally and absolutely false and the   Clintons know it and they know it very   well these flames are all fabricated   they're pure fiction and they're   outright lies these events never ever   happened and the people that said them   meekly fully understand you take a look   at these people you study these people   and you'll understand also the claims   are preposterous ludicrous and defy   truth common sense and logic we already   have substantial evidence to dispute   these laws and it will be made public in   an appropriate way and at an appropriate   time very soon these lies come from   outlets whose past stories and past lens   have already been discredited the media   outlets did not even attempt to confirm   the most basic facts because even a   simple investigation would have shown   that these were nothing more than false   smears   [Applause]   six months ago the failing New York   Times wrote a massive story attacking me   and the central witness they used said   the story was false that she was quoted   inaccurately she said that I was a great   guy she had great courage I'll be honest   with you she was an amazing person and   never made those remarks that I was a   great guy and never made the remarks and   when I read the service sort of   surprised how could she say that and she   didn't say we demanded a retraction but   they refused the printed just like they   refused the pin the comments from   another source who praised me in her   book or the words of another wonderful   woman who said really nice things about   me they put other statements that she   didn't say they misrepresented the story   was a fraud and a big embarrassment to   the new york times and it was a big   front-page story front page center color   picture a disgrace they were very   embarrassed it will be part of the   lawsuit we are preparing against them   you   now today the same two discredited   writers who should have been fired from   the New York Times for what they did   tell another totally fabricated and   false story that supposedly took place   on an aeroplane more than 30 years ago   another ridiculous tale no witnesses no   nothing then there was a writer from   People magazine who wrote a story on   Milania and myself on our first   anniversary the story was beautiful it   was beautiful it was lovely but last   night we hear that after 12 years this   took place 12 years ago the story and   then claimed that i made inappropriate   advances during the interview to this   writer   [Applause]   and I asked very simple question well I   wasn't it part of the story that   appeared 20 or 12 years ago why was it a   part of the story why didn't they make   it part of the story I was one of the   biggest stars on television with the   apprentice and it would have been one of   the biggest stories of the year think of   it she's doing this story on Milania   who's pregnant at the time and Donald   Trump our one year anniversary and she   said I made inappropriate advances and   by the way the area was a public area   people all over the place take a look   you take a look look at her look at her   words you tell me what you think I don't   think so I don't   Oh   but it is amazing doing a story a love   story on how great we are together and   by the way we're stronger today that we   were ever were before which is but it's   a love story it's a love story on our   one year and if I did that she would   have added that it would have been the   headline and who would have done that if   you're doing this and you're one of the   top shows on television these people are   horrible people they're horrible   horrible liars and interestingly it   happens to appear 26 days before our   very important election isn't that   amazing this invented account has   already been debunked by eyewitnesses   who there they were there the very   witness identified by the author has   said the story is totally false by the   way this is a room that everybody can   see it Scott glass walls satmar Lago   it's got glass walls can you believe   this why wasn't it in the story biggest   story of the year this weekend the new   york times published a full-page hit   faced with another claim from an   individual who has been totally   discredited based on the many many many   emails and letters she is sent to our   office over the years looking for work   Donald is great wanting to go to my   rallies but the New York Times and this   was a full op-ed piece refuse to use the   evidence that we presented refused to   use it if they used it if they would   have looked they would have said all   there's no siree others in the media   which almost surprises me because   they're dishonest also were presented   with this story by this woman numerous   times and they got very excited but   after seeing the evidence that we   immediately   give them all of them refuse to write   the story there was no story the time   zone didn't want to see it they just   wrote the story and this was a full page   opposite the editorials this is part of   a concerted effort led by the New York   Times and others now the New York Times   is fighting desperately for its   relevance and its financial survival and   it probably won't even be around in a   few years based on its financial outlook   which wouldn't be a bad thing if you   want to know the fire but as it winds   down its years and it's becoming more   and more problematic it's gotten more   and more vicious more and more vile and   even the other mainstream media is   talking about the single greatest pi log   in history and all between now and   november eighth and you have to see the   stories they've written it's one after   another after another and facts mean   nothing third-rate journalism the great   editors of the past from the New York   Times and others ladies and gentlemen   are spinning in their grave I will not   allow the Clinton machine to turn our   campaign into a discussion of their   slanders and lies but will remain   focused on the issues facing the   American people   [Applause]   thank you thank you but let me state   this as clearly as I can these attacks   are orchestrated by the Clintons and   their media allies the only thing   Hillary Clinton has going for herself is   the press without the press she is   absolutely zero and you saw that the   other night in the debate where some   people said she made virtually a fool of   herself this is not presidential   material believe me what they say is   false and slanderous in virtually every   respect we are now less than a month   from the most important election of our   lifetime indeed one of the most   important elections in the history of   our country and the polls are showing us   in a dead heat don't believe what you   said the new highly respected Rasmussen   poll just came out this morning it's   just released shows up nationally two   points ahead Trump you   just came out so now the Clinton machine   is put forward a small handful of people   out of tens of thousands of people over   the years that I've met that I've worked   with that I've employed in order to make   wild and false allegations that fail to   me even the most basic test of common   sense not even common sense again this   is nothing more than an attempt to   destroy our movement and for the   Clintons to keep their corrupt control   over a government when I declared my   candidacy I knew what bad shape our   country was in and believe me all you   have to do is look at world events all   you have to do is look at the 1.7   billion dollars that we sent to Iran in   cash in cash   all you have to do is see the way Isis   was created in the vacuum left by   Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama out of   Iraq all you have to do all you have to   do is look at the 800 people that were   very very not good for our nation they   were going to be deported lo and behold   instead of being deported they were made   citizens of the United States just   herself and lo and behold sadly the 800   people is wrong it turned out to be   close to 1,800 people out president is   incompetent all he wants to do is   campaign and the last thing he wants to   happen is to have Donald Trump terminate   Obamacare and do all of the other things   that are destroyed   he's led a very divided nation and it's   only gotten worse and the last thing our   country needs is four more years of   Barack Obama believe me I've seen   firsthand the corruption and the   sickness that has taken over our   politics you've seen it and I've seen it   and we're all watching together they   knew they would throw every lie they   couldn't me and my family and my loved   ones they'd do they would stop at   nothing to try to stop me but I never   knew as bad as it would be i never knew   it would be this file that it would be   this bad that it would be this vicious   nevertheless i take all of these slings   and arrows gladly for you   [Applause]   I take them for our movement so that we   can have our country back our great   civilization here in America and across   the civilized world has come upon a   moment of reckoning we've seen it in the   United Kingdom where they voted to   liberate themselves from global   government and global trade deals and   global immigration deals that have   destroyed their sovereignty and have   destroyed many of those nations but the   central base of world political power is   right here an American and it is our   corrupt political establishment that is   the greatest power behind the efforts at   radical globalization and the   disenfranchisement of working people   their financial resources are virtually   unlimited their political resources are   unlimited their media resources are   unmatched and most importantly the   depths of their immorality is absolutely   unlimited   [Applause]   they will allow radical Islamic   terrorists to enter our country by the   thousands they will allow the great   Trojan horse and I don't want people   looking back in a hundred years and 200   years and have that story be told about   us because we were led by inept   incompetent and corrupt people like   Barack Obama and like Hillary Clinton we   don't want to be part of that history   and by the way President Obama should   stop campaigning and start working on   creating jobs start working on getting   our GDP up start working on   strengthening our borders the corrupt   political establishment is a machine it   has no soul I knew these false attacks   would come I knew this day would arrive   it's only a question of wet and I knew   the American people would rise above it   and vote for the future they deserve   the only thing that can stop this   corrupted machine is you the only force   strong enough to save our country is us   the only people brave enough to vote out   this corrupt establishment is you the   American people we are going to have a   policy America first   [Applause]   they control incredibly the Department   of Justice and they even secretly meet   with the attorney general of the united   states in the back of her airplane while   on the runway remember he was there he's   going to play golf oh oh gee the   Attorney General oh let me go say hello   planes in the runway let me go say hello   to the Attorney General all he never got   to play golf I understand and it was   Arizona a place I love but the weather   was about a hundred and some-odd degrees   now he's not going to play he was never   there to play golf folks don't be   foolish they met for 39 minutes and most   likely it was to discuss her   reappointment in a Clinton   administration as the Attorney General   just prior to making a decision over   whether or not to prosecute Hillary   Clinton okay that's what happened that's   called real life and that's pretty sad   they met for 39 minutes remember he said   we talked to golf and we talked about   our grandchildren   three minutes for the grandchildren two   minutes for the Gulf then they SAT there   and they twiddle their thumbs now I   believe they talked about her remaining   in her position under a crooked Hillary   Clinton administration that's what I   believe that's what I believe folks   that's what I believe and I think that's   what most people in this room believe   [Applause]   likewise they have essentially corrupted   the director of the FBI to the point at   which stories are already saying that   the great and they are truly great men   and women who worked for the FBI are   embarrassed and ashamed of what he's   done to one of our truly great   institutions the FBI itself   Hillary Clinton is guilty of all the   things that director called me stated at   his press conference and congressional   hearings and far more he stated many   things but it's far more and he knows   that and yet after reading all of these   items where she's so guilty he let her   off the hook while other lives including   General Petraeus and many others have   been destroyed for doing far far less   this is a conspiracy against you the   American people and we can not let this   happen or continue   this is our moment of reckoning as a   society and as a civilization itself I   didn't need to do this folks believe me   believe me I built a great company and a   wonderful life I could have enjoyed the   fruits and benefit of years of   successful business deals and businesses   for myself at my family instead of going   through this absolute horror show of   lies deceptions malicious attacks who   would have thought I'm doing it because   this country has given me so much and I   feel so strongly that it's my turn to   give back to the country that I love   [Applause]   many of my friends and many political   experts warned me that this campaign   would be a journey to hell said that but   they're wrong it will be a journey to   heaven because we will help so many   people that are so desperately in need   of help   [Applause]   in my former life I was an insider as   much as anybody else and I knew what   it's like and I still know what it's   like to be an insider it's not bad not   bad now I'm being punished for leaving   the special Club and revealing to you   the terrible things that are going on   having to do with our country because I   used to be part of the club I'm the only   one that can fix it I'm doing this for   the people and for the movement and we   will take back this country for you and   we will make America great again   to corrupt establishment knows that we   are a great threat to their criminal   enterprise they know that if we win   their power is gone and it's returned to   you the people will be the dark clouds   hanging over our government to be lifted   and replaced with a bright future but it   all depends on whether we let the   corrupt media decide our future or   whether we let the American people   decide our future this litton campaign   of destruction is allowed to work then   no other highly successful and this is   so true i mean i've seen this so many   times and I've heard this all of my life   I've heard it all of my life if we let   this happen then no other highly   successful person which is what our   country needs it needs a certain   thinking when you look at our trade   deals that are so bad when you look as   an example on trade we're going to lose   almost 800 billion dollars this year   trade deficit almost 800 billion our   debt has doubled in seven and a half   years to almost 20 trillion dollars   under Obama   no other sick sexual person after   watching this and no other very   successful person will ever again ever   and who can blame them even me I'd say   you're right will ever again run for   office I've heard it for years if you're   very successful you can't run for high   office especially for president I said I   don't care I don't care I've done so   many games I've done so well it's a   certain mindset that we need in our   country at least for a period of time we   have to straighten our country out I   will not lie to you these false attacks   are absolutely hurtful to be lied about   to be slandered to be speared so   publicly and before your family that you   love is very painful what is going on is   egregious beyond anyone's people that   know the story people that see the story   people that know the facts they can't   even believe it it's reprehensible   beyond description it's totally corrupt   but I also know that it's not about me   it's about all of you and it's about our   country I know that I fully understood   that's why I got involved it's about all   of us together as a country it's a   movement the likes of which we have   never in history in this country seen   before never in history even the pundits   even the media that truly dislikes   Donald Trump for their own reasons will   admit this is a movement the likes of   which people have never seen before and   it's a movement about the veterans who   need medical care   the mothers who have lost their beloved   children to terrorism and to crime it's   about the inner cities and the border   towns who desperately need our help it's   about the millions of jobless people in   America it's about the American workers   who can't get jobs because our jobs have   left for Mexico and so many other   countries   [Applause]   this election is about the people being   crushed by obamacare and it's about   defeating Isis and appointing a Supreme   Court and a Supreme Court justice it   could be four or five who will defend   and protect our Constitution   [Applause]   this election is also about so   importantly to me african-american and   Hispanic American people whose   communities have been plunged into crime   poverty and failing schools by the   policies of crooked Hillary Clinton   believe me she's crooked they've robbed   these citizens of their future and if we   win I will give them their hope their   jobs their education I will give them   their security but the inner cities   education is almost worthless is   horrible we're going to have common core   ended we're going to bring education   look but you look at the inner cities   and you see bad education no jobs no   safety you walk to the grocery store   with your child and you get shot you   walk outside to look and see what's   happening and you get shot in Chicago   3,000 people have been shot since   January first we're not going to let   that happen our inner cities are almost   at an all-time low run by the Democrats   for sometimes more than a hundred years   chain unbroken so they have no jobs they   have horrible education they have no   safety or security and I say to the   african-american community what the hell   do you have to lose I will fix it I will   fix it I will make it good I'll bring   back our jobs will have good education   will have great safety in the inner city   and we will help the Hispanic American   people who had been treated so badly and   so unfairly in our nation we will help   them I will deliver like you've never   seen before I deliver whether people   like Donald Trump or not they all say he   delivers vote for Donald Trump you're   going to see something and you be so   happy you'll be so thrilled this   election is about every man woman and   child in our country who deserves to   live in safety prosperity and peace so   true we will eyes above the lies the   smears the ludicrous Landers from   ludicrous and very very dishonest   reporters we will vote for the country   we want we will vote for the future we   want we will vote for the politics we   want and we will vote to put this   corrupt government cartel out of   business and out of business immediately   [Applause]   we will vote for the special interests   and say lot's of luck but you're being   voted out of power they've betrayed our   workers they betrayed our borders and   most of all they betrayed our freedoms   we will save our sovereign rights as a   nation we will end the politics of   profit we will end the rule of special   interests we will end the rating of our   jobs by other countries we will end the   total disenfranchisement of the American   voter and the American worker our   independence day is at hand and it   arrives finally on november eighth   join me in taking back our country and   creating a bright glorious and   prosperous new future for our people we   will make America great again and it   will happen quickly god bless you god   bless you thank you thank you   [Music]   [Music]   you   ah   you   you
Cq8k_Suw2ME~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161026~Full Speech: Donald Trump Foreign Policy Speech in Charlotte, North Carolina (10/2672016)~8964.0~4.84000015259~312.0~13.0~   a great honor and the distinct pleasure   of introducing who I believe and who I   stand behind as the next president of   the United States Donald ray j truck   thank you   [Music]   thank you   thank you Pastor a great great honor and   it's great to be here in Charlotte to   discuss an issue that means so much to   me that's the issue of urban renewal   something you don't hear very much about   and the rebuilding of our inner cities   today I want to talk about how to grow   the African American middle class and to   provide a new deal for black America   that deal is grounded in three promises   safe communities great education and   high-paying jobs my vision rests on a   principle that has defined this campaign   right from the beginning and you've seen   where we've come from and where we are   right now it's called America first   every African American citizen in this   country is entitled to a government that   puts their jobs wages and security first   I'm asking today for the honor of your   vote and the privilege to represent you   as your president   [Applause]   and I will not let you down you watch   here is the promise I make to you   whether you vote for me or not I will be   your greatest champion we live in a very   divided country but i will be your   greatest champion   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   I have no special interest I take no   orders from donors or lobbyists I put a   lot of money into this campaign believe   me I'll be in for over a hundred million   dollars that's a lot I work for you and   I work only for you   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   our campaign is about change optimism   and the future I'm asking people to   break from the bitter failures of the   past and to imagine the amazing   possibilities for our future and our   future together our opponent represents   the rigged system and the failed   thinking of yesterday Hillary Clinton's   campaign offers only the depressing   pessimism that says this is as good as   it gets and it's never going to get   better she's been doing this for 30   years and for 30 years it's only gotten   worse American politics is caught in a   time loop we keep electing the same   people over and over and over   [Music]   [Applause]   and they keep coming back to the   african-american community and the   Hispanic community and they keep talking   about what they're going to do and they   don't do it and then four years later   you see him again it's enough   [Applause]   they keep making the same mistakes and   they keep offering the same old lame   excuses when nothing happens you know   that I know that frankly everybody knows   that the fact that are corrupt   Washington establishment has tried so   hard to stop our movement we have a   major movement there's never been   anything like it in this country and   this is so important to me what I'm   saying today I wanted a small group of   very very powerful influential people   from the African American community and   that's what I wanted to do enough with   the rallies of 25 and 30 thousand people   this was very important to me   [Applause]   and I just met with some of the finest   people I've ever met backstage we had a   great meeting and I just want to thank   those but those people right now they   are phenomenal people so I want to say   thank you very much but it's just more   proof that we represent the kind of   change that arrives only once in a   lifetime this is a movement that's once   it left i'm never gonna happen again   we're going to have another opportunity   every day i'm out on the trail proposing   fresh solutions and new thinking and   every day the same people getting richer   off our broken system tell us that we   can't change and that we can't try   anything new because it's not good for   them I have a message for all of the   doubters in Washington America's future   belongs to the dreamers not the cynics   and not the critics   and it's time to extend that dream to   every African American citizen in this   country African American citizens have   sacrificed so much for our nation they   fought and died in every war since the   revolution and from the pews and the   picket lines they've lifted up the   conscience of our country in the long   march for civil rights yet too many   [Music]   thank you yet too many African Americans   have been left behind mess of numbers   have been left behind forty five percent   of african-american children under the   age of six live in poverty fifty-eight   percent of african-american youth are   not currently employed African Americans   comprise roughly thirteen percent of the   population yet make up sixty percent of   murder victims under the age of 22 that   some numbers that the sum number in 2015   violent crime in Charlotte increased by   eighteen percent and it's expected to   rise to twenty four percent this year in   Chicago nearly 3,500 people have been   shot since January first of this year   it's not a very long time when I think   of it 3,500 people the conditions in our   inner cities today are totally   unacceptable and we have to fix them the   Democrats have run   [Music]   the Democrats have run our inner cities   for 50 60 70 years or more   uninterruptedly school boards the City   Council's the mayor's office and the   congressional seats their policies have   failed and they failed miserably they've   trapped children and failing government   schools an opposed school choice at   every single turn the Clintons gave us   NAFTA one of the worst economic deals in   the history of any country it's taking   our jobs it's taken our companies it's   taken everything so much out of our   country and China's entry into the World   Trade Organization two deals that truly   d industrialized America uprooted our   industry and stripped bare towns like   Detroit in Baltimore and the inner   cities of North Carolina where we are   really focusing and by the way you see   the new polls coming out where we're   really doing well which is which is okay   yeah thank you we're gonna win North   Carolina day gonna win Florida actually   we're gonna win Florida till we're gonna   win Ohio and we're gonna win Iowa and   when we're winning a lot of states you   get little word back there I'll say the   media does then what's going on over you   you have to see in Florida they have   lines that a four blocks long trying to   get into the polling booths they'd never   say about it and same thing in many   other states that are starting this   state has lost nearly half of its   manufacturing job since Bill and   Hillary's and after think good half   decimated by the way and they have been   decimated decimating the   african-american community and the   African American middle class decimated   these jobs went to Mexico and other   places politicians Democratic policies   have also given rise to crippling crime   and total violence then there's the   issue of taxation and regulation massive   taxes massive regulation of small   business and radical restrictions on   American energy have driven jobs and   opportunities out of our inner cities   under many cases out of our country   hillary wants to raise taxes very very   substantially on everybody and on   business and especially on small   business as high as forty five percent   which will only drive more jobs out of   your community out of our country and   into other countries one of the greatest   portrayals has been the issue of   immigration illegal immigration violates   the civil rights of african-americans   that's what's been happening   [Applause]   no group has been more economically   harmed by decades of illegal immigration   then low-income african-american workers   Hillary's pledge to enact open borders   made in secret to a foreign bank   WikiLeaks his WikiLeaks is unbelievable   what we've learned about her and her   people what they've said about her   behind her back but now it's not behind   her back she's got bad instincts   according to John Podesta Hillary   Clinton as bad instincts I wouldn't want   my people saying those things I wonder   what they're saying to some way we can   check it out now they say terrible   terrible things about her so I mean if   they say that they work with her all the   time why would we want her to be   president at the center of my   revitalization plan is the issue of   trade massive chronic trade deficits   have emptied out our jobs just look at   what's happened to Baltimore Detroit   Pittsburgh Cleveland and right here in   North Carolina you know that for a fact   it's the greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world if I'm president   and the executives at ford motor company   announced they're moving their plants   and jobs to Mexico I will pick up the   phone and make a very very simple call I   don't know if its presidential but I'd   rather do it myself we can   [Applause]   who cares   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   okay very good   [Music]   very funny very nice you screaming make   that call make that call takes me five   minutes I'd rather do it myself it'll   get done properly I will tell those   executives that if they move their   factories to Mexico I will put a   thirty-five percent tax on their product   which in this case is small cars you   know they're moving their small car   plants out of mostly Michigan moving to   Mexico and it's terrible they're going   to make their small cars that's a big   things might be a small car but it's a   lot of business before they ship it back   to the United States so they going to   pay a tax 35% you tell them and you know   what they're going to stay they're gonna   stay they're not leaving they're not   leaving but nobody ever since the   politicians don't say that because   they're getting campaign contributions   from these people and their special   interests so they're not going to say me   I'm saying it i'm doing what's right i'm   working for you folks we're gonna get   this leg right we're gonna get it right   such a big problem our jobs are leaving   us and people are being fired all over   the country or plants or factors are   leaving us we won't let your jobs be   stolen from you anymore it could happen   so we when we stop offshoring to   low-wage countries we raise wages at   home meaning rent and bills become   instantly more affordable at the same   time my plan to lower the business tax   from thirty five percent to fifteen   percent will bring thousands of new   companies on to our shores you'll have   jobs you'll have jobs though it also   includes a massive middle class tax cut   tax free childcare savings accounts and   childcare tax deductions and credits and   a total simplification of the tax code   [Applause]   i will also proposed tax holidays for   inner-city investment a new tax   incentive to get foreign companies to   relocate in blighted American   neighborhoods and they will do that it   will be worthwhile it's called incentive   they will do it I will further I will   further empower cities and states to   seek a federal disaster designation for   blighted communities in order to   initiate the rebuilding of vital   infrastructure the demolition of   abandoned properties and the increased   presence of law enforcement so we have   safety in our community we need them we   need that for safety or silver some of   our inner cities are more dangerous than   some of the war zones that were reading   about them seeing about every night we   have to stop that i will also pursue   financial reforms to make it easier for   young african-americans to get credit to   pursue their dreams in business and   create jobs in their communities it's   going to be beautiful such talent   there's such a potential talent out   there it's so incredible and it's   totally being wasted wasted by   politicians that maybe don't want to see   it happen dodd-frank has been a disaster   making it harder for small businesses to   get the credit they need you folks know   that the policies of the Clintons   brought us the financial recession   through lifting glass-steagall pushing   subprime lending and blocking reforms to   fannie and freddie to friendly names but   they're not so friendly   it's time for a 21st century   glass-steagall and as part of that a   priority on helping african-american   businesses get the credit they need we   will also encourage small business   creation by allowing social welfare   workers to convert poverty assistance   into repayable but forgivable microloans   very simple but something so good then   there's the issue of Public Safety   making our community safe again will be   a priority for the Trump administration   safe   thank you i love you too who's   now I mean so many so many people so   many people I mean you walk to the store   to buy a loaf of bread maybe with your   child and you get shot your child gets   shot gotta stop at no good no good we   need safety I have heard and I've   listened to the concerns raised by   African American citizens about our   justice system and I promise that under   a trump administration the law will be   applied fairly equally end without   prejudice for the milk   [Music]   [Applause]   there will be only one set of rules not   a two-tiered system of justice like we   have right now you just see that with   Hillary Clinton I mean think of it Thank   you Thank of it she deletes 33,000   emails after getting a subpoena from the   United States Congress and she has no   trouble and in your community you know   what you're going through can you   imagine if you did that can you imagine   if I did that I think that we have   subdued the electric chair forget about   you how about me would I be in trouble   it is so unfair it is so unfair that   she's even allowed to run for the office   of person   and then you probably read six hundred   and seventy five thousand dollars went   to the wife of the head of the FBI who   was in charge of the investigation to   her campaign no no is this is this too   hard to believe I mean went to the head   of the FBI's wife who was in charge of   the investigation of the Hillary Clinton   email scandal and then you wonder gee I   wonder why she got off that is a serious   horrible thing look too horrible things   it's not even believable I have people   great great lawyers they can't even   believe what's happening the best   evidence of unequal justice is that   Hillary Clinton could violate so many   Louis bleach and delete her 33,000   emails and especially after the subpoena   from Congress lied to Congress lie to   the FBI put her national security at   grave risk when our national security   was put at unbelievable risk with what   she was doing and not even face so much   as a minor fine now think of it a major   general a man four star general that's   about the top general james Cochran lied   one time to the FBI and he probably did   it he did it in my opinion for national   security reasons they may go to jail for   five year sentence they go in five years   he may go to jail for five years one   time to the FBI she lied looks like   hundreds of times hundreds how about you   couldn't remember 39 times well each one   of those 39 was a lie right   equal justice also means the same rules   for Wall Street the Obama administration   never held Wall Street accountable we   will also police our streets have to   make our streets safe I want every poor   african-american child to be able to   walk down the street in peace and not be   scared and not be hurt   the problem is not the presence of   police but the absence of ways we need   really a great group of people to keep   you safe to keep us all safe to keep us   all safe you know the murder rate in the   United States I don't know if you know   this because the press never talks about   it is the highest it's been think of   this in 45 years nobody knows that the   murder rate highest it's been in 45   years I will invest in training and   funding both local and federal law   enforcement operations to remove the   gang members drug dealers and criminal   cartels from our movies   the reduction of crime is not merely a   goal it's a necessity for all of us we   will get it done the war on police urged   on by my rival is really reckless what's   happening is reckless and dangerous and   puts African American lives at risk and   all you have to do is look at the   statistics and you see what's happening   we must work with our police not against   them we're going to work together and   we're going to have an amazing   relationship because you know everybody   wants the same thing we all really want   the same thing our immigration that is   my policy on immigration is so simple we   will restore the civil rights of African   Americans Hispanic Americans and all   Americans by ending illegal immigration   and yes we will go below ruh-oh bill the   wall   [Applause]   and we're going to stop the inflow the   massive inflow of drugs which is coming   into your community more than any   community but coming into your community   and poisoning our youth and poisoning   many other people but poisoning our   youth I will reform visa rules to give   American workers preference for jobs and   I will suspend reckless refugee   admissions from tara prone regions that   cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of   dollars   a portion of the massive amounts of   money saved by enforcing our loans and   suspending refugees will be reinvested   in our inner cities don't forget many of   these refugees are coming from Syria and   other parts of the world we don't know   where they're from who they are what   their thought processes and they're   being let in by the thousands and   thousands and thousands and Hillary   Clinton wants to allow a five hundred   and fifty percent increase over what   President Obama is allowed we don't know   we don't know what's going to happen   this is the story of the Trojan horse   this is your second Trojan horse   guaranteed and I can tell you right now   it's not happening not with me it will   be ended it will be that will be ended   we have enough problems that I've gotten   it's time to help the American citizens   will become refugees in their own   country infrastructure will be another   major goal my contract calls for one   trillion dollars in infrastructure   investment of which the inner cities   will be a major beneficiary we need   something done it's so bad you look at   your roads and you look at your your   everything you look at your schools and   hospitals everything it's so bad I will   also cancel all wasteful climate change   spending from Obama clan   we're giving billions and billions of   dollars away we have no idea for what   and others aren't doing so much believe   me they are laughing I'll tell you   that's what they're doing they're   laughing at us including all global   warming payments to the United Nations   billions of dollars I've listened to   this these steps will save 100 billion   dollars over eight years and this money   will be used to help rebuild the vital   infrastructure including water systems   in America's inner cities you see Flint   Michigan what's happened there but it's   horrible I was there and it is   unbelievable horrible incompetent   politicians doing the wrong thing school   choice is at the center of my plan such   a great thing and by the way we're going   to terminate common core and bring   education   [Applause]   so important look it's not working the   way it is now I don't know why anybody   would even fight it well we know who's   fighting you know that my proposal   redirects education spending to allow   every disadvantaged child in America   attend the public private charter magnet   religious or home school of their choice   [Music]   school choice is the great civil rights   issue of our time and I will be the   nation's biggest cheerleader for school   choice in all 50 states what a   difference agreement   I will also be establishing a commission   which will include some of the   tremendous people I've met backstage   today raise your hands I mean you people   were sewing thank you so great some   great ideas to tackle the   school-to-prison pipeline and to shut   that pipeline down and to create so   important and to create a new pathway   that leads from a great education   instead to a great job that's what we   want it is at school to Prison my plan   will also ensure funding for historical   black colleges and universities more   affordable two and four-year college and   support for trade and vocational   education you know I've gone to school   with many people some totally brilliant   at one thing but not at all brilliant at   others but we all know this we've had   students that sat next to us in class   and they were terrible students but they   were phenomenal at fixing a car engine   they were phenomenal at fixing a   television set they can take it apart   blindfolded and I can't do that and you   can't do that but they were phenomenal   at fixing things we don't do that   anymore remember we used to have this   great vocational education they talented   then we're great there were horrible   students and they were great they could   they can take a motor that can take an   engine apart blindfolded and we have to   bring that back and that's what they   love doing that's what they love doing   and they'll do fantastic   [Applause]   don't you think right so true so we're   going to get that going together finally   today my agenda includes the protection   of religious liberty   [Applause]   [Applause]   it's great nights to see it's very nice   listen   that's something you'll never hear from   Hillary Clinton but I can tell you the   promotion of family and support for the   african-american church it's been a   tremendous power in this country for so   many years this is just the beginning   because I will never ever take the   african-american community for granted   never ever unlike Hillary because   nothing does nothing for the Hispanics   or for the african-american communities   it will be my mission to prove to this   country that yesterday does not have to   be tomorrow   [Applause]   the vicious cycle of poverty can be   broken and great new things can happen   for all of our people great new things   can happen but to achieve this future we   must reject the failed elites from   Washington who've been wrong about   virtually everything happening for   decades hey they've been wrong about the   wars they've been wrong about jobs   they've been wrong about everything and   the question is are they are they stupid   the question is are they stupid or do   they have a plan I actually think for   the most part they have a plan but some   are not too smart and you're right about   the swamp save again right you better   believe it boy that is that is a you   know I said that about a week ago and I   didn't like it that much didn't sound   that great and the whole world picked it   up so it shows you what I know it's   crazy drain the swamp we're gonna drain   the swamp of Washington we're gonna have   fun doing it we're all doing it together   it is funny   [Applause]   funny things like that happen I was   listening the other day to a great   singer great one of the great legends   and said that you know certain so did   you like it didn't like it became one of   the greatest hits of all time so drain   the swamp I didn't like it now I love it   right the people opposing us promised   that passing NAFTA and opening up our   markets to China would bring a new era   of jobs and prosperity that didn't   happen instead they brought only poverty   and heartache and loss the people   opposing us are the same people who   weave and think of this who've wasted   six trillion dollars on wars in the   Middle East we could have rebuilt our   country twice that have produced only   more terrorism more death more suffering   imagine if that money had been spent   right here in our home we've totally   destabilized the Middle East than if you   think about it six trillion dollars and   it was far better 15 years ago so we've   made it worse we spent six trillion lost   thousands of lives you could say   hundreds of thousands of lives because   look at the other side walls so we lost   hundreds of thousands of lives and were   far worse off than we were when we   started who would the people that do   this and then we end the war in such a   bad way that a vacuum is formed and we   have Isis and that was the JV the junior   varsity but now the JV is violent and   vicious and ensconced in 32 different   nations and the one that gave us the JV   now says how she's going to get rid of   it not going to happen folks just words   just words jess was for 30 years she's   been talking for 30 years only bad   things happened for her she tried to   build democracy in Libyan and she failed   she tried to build democracy in Iraq and   she failed she tried regime change in   Egypt and that was a disaster she   pressed regime change in syria and that   failed she tried a russian reset that   was laughed at left an Putin has no   respect for her whatsoever see I'm not   allowed to say it but but I'll accept it   [Applause]   [Music]   who said   [Applause]   a star is born now if I said that I'd be   in big trouble she tried an Asia pivot   and that failed now Hillary Clinton   wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia   with a shooting war in Syria that could   very well lead us into world war three   for one she doesn't get it she doesn't   understand remember her top person says   she has bad instincts got bad instincts   and by the way we want to be so strong   we want to make our military system we   want to take care of our vets better   than they've ever been taking fire   [Applause]   peace through strength East rooster we   have no choice is a very vicious time   this is not a time to have a depleted a   depleted military when I can have that   we have the greatest people in the world   in the military we're not going to have   that but we are going to take care of   our vets also finally our opponents   passed a health care law embraced by   Hillary Clinton over the furious   objections of the American voter and   most politicians I mean they didn't want   it other than he lied and lied he can   have your plan he can have your doctor   28 different times and enough Democrats   went over to that side they made a   mistake Obamacare is now destroying our   health care system premiums are   skyrocketing double digits and are   surging by more than one hundred percent   and they give it in the great state of   Arizona I love Arizona it's going up one   hundred and eighteen percent oh but   don't worry you're going to catch their   to first doctors acquitting insurers are   leaving and companies are fling every   prediction they made about this law was   alive and I said it was going to be no   good before it was ever passed if we   don't repeal and replace Obamacare we   will lose our health care system forever   we have to get rid of it it's a disaster   it's too expensive it doesn't work and   you get no coverage but deductible is so   high that you'll essentially never use   it now is the time to embrace a new   direction I've been very lucky and I've   led a great life now I want to give back   to the country which I love and which is   here so quickly   [Applause]   I just left a hotel beautiful beautiful   building it was the old post office on   Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC and   it's mine and it was just built it's   right between the Capitol building and   the White House so this way i figure   i'll get to Washington one way or the   other pennsylvania avenue you but i'm   very proud of it and I'm very proud of   my children because we delivered it   under budget and ahead of schedule   creating thousands of jobs including   construction it will be one of the   finest hotels anywhere in the world and   a great symbol for our country for many   years to come I took two hours to fly   into Washington to cut the ribbon with   my children and then jump on the plane   to be here with you just did   [Applause]   I wanted to be there for my children who   worked so hard on the hotel they worked   so hard in particular evanka in this go   and I always feel this I feel this so   strongly parents must stick and   encourage and support their children   would have been very bad they work work   work 24 hours a day always working and   then you say I'm not going it takes the   heart out of I'm right don't you think I   mean they did a great job in the hotel   and I told them so and Hillary said   Donald Trump took time off the campaign   can you believe it here's the woman goes   home because she goes to sleep all the   time think of it she's got no energy   whatsoever everyone's talking about the   fact that I'll do seven eight nine stops   I'll make three or four major speeches   like for instance right after this we   have thousands and thousands of people   in North Carolina coming to another one   last night 25,000 people i got home at   one o'clock in the morning here's a   woman she makes a speech for 15 minutes   she goes home goes to bed honestly she   has less energy than Jeb Bush Audrina   [Applause]   and the reason i bring him up he didn't   sign the pledge so he's open game so he   signed the pledge right but he didn't   honor it how do you how do you live with   yourself you know he signs a pledge and   he doesn't live so we we figure but how   do you like that and then she has a   speech today she criticized me for going   to the opening of this building which   was in and out it's not the way life   works but I was also there for another   reason the workers they did a   magnificent job they were there and   without them it could never have been   built so quickly or so beautifully the   rebuilding we did at the old post office   is the rebuilding I want to do for our   country we're going to rebuild our   coffee   I want to go into the inner cities the   poor rural communities of the failing   schools and I want to work on a national   plan for total revitalization we're   going to be so proud of our country   again I'm tired of the excuses from our   lame politicians I'm tired of being told   that it can't be done I'm tired of   people asking Americans to defer their   dreams for another day but they really   mean for many decades enough waiting the   time is down there is nothing we cannot   accomplish there is no task or project   too great there is no dream outside of   our reach everywhere I go in this   country all I see is untapped potential   waiting to be set free and maybe the   greatest of that potential is in the   african-american communities this so   much potential   but we will never realize that potential   if we continue putting our faith in a   broken political system that has let us   down time and time again we have to   choose the more up to aquis have to   choose to believe not in our politicians   not in these people that got us there   but to believe in ourselves and the   future of our country if we do that   anything is possible so I'm asking   America to join me in dreaming big and   bold things for our future let's close   the history books on the failures in   Washington and let's open a new chapter   of success and prosperity for everyone   especially now especially for our   african-american communities and that's   going to happen   I am very humbled beyond words to be the   nominee of the party of Abraham Lincoln   a lot of people don't know that it's the   party of over Hamlin and it is my   highest and greatest hope that the   Republican Party can be the home in the   future and forevermore for   african-americans and the   african-american vote because I will   produce and i will get others to produce   and we know for a fact it doesn't work   with the democrats and it certainly   isn't going to work with Hillary   together we will have a government of By   and For the People and we will make   America great again for all Americans   thank you very much and God bless you   everybody great honor to be here thank   you god bless you   ah   you   [Music]

debate last night   Mike Pence did an incredible job and I'm   getting a lot of credit because that's   really my first so-called choice that   was my first hire as we would say in Las   Vegas and and I'll tell use a good one   he was phenomenal he was cool he was   smart he was I mean you just take a look   at him he was meant to be doing what   he's doing and we are very very proud of   Governor Mike pets thank you Mike Pence   [Applause]   I'd argue that Mike had the single most   decisive victory in the history of vice   presidential debates I believe that and   last night America also got to look   first hand at my judgment and that was   judgment you know you need judgment for   people for deals we don't do deals like   the Iran deal we don't do deals like   that anymore folks we don't do deals   like that 1.7 billion in cash and we're   in Las Vegas when you hear 1.7 billion I   think this whole stage would be filled   up to the roof whoever heard of things   like what's going on unbelievable well   Mike laid out big and bold solutions for   America his opponent talked only of   small and petty distractions   Hillary Clinton has been there for 30   years and hasn't fixed anything she goes   around will do this will do that will do   this all these things that's all   wonderful the problem is why didn't she   do him in fact she's just made things   worse she failed in upstate New York as   a senator promising to create in order   to get elected 200,000 jobs but   manufacturing is down more than forty   percent and the jobs have left it's just   the opposite she failed overseas   producing only death and destruction she   unleashed Isis he stabilized Iraq Syria   Libya and put Iran onto the path of   nuclear weapons in less than 10 years   now they will have nuclear weapons one   of the dumbest deals ever made whether   it's countries or any kind of a deal you   can think of one of the dumbest deals   ever made at home Hilary Clinton failed   Latinos and african-americans producing   only more poverty in there in the inner   cities and you see that you see that all   wherever you go to the inner cities   nothing happens it never happens it's   called give me you vote and then they   don't come back four years later they   come back she's merely the vessel for   the global special interest bleeding our   country dry they are bleeding our   country I'm running to represent   Americans and we are going to make   America rich again   we're not rich we're debtor nation right   now I'm going to end illegal immigration   stop the massive inflow of refugees keep   jobs from pouring out of our country   renegotiate our totally disastrous trade   deals and massively reduced taxes and   regulations on our workers and our   businesses my economic agenda will be   very very simple it's called jobs jobs   jobs   our jobs are all leaving the problems we   face as a country are immense and it's   going to take bold action to turn things   around we need to change we need change   right now we owe 20 trillion dollars   debt 20 trillion dollars it doubled   under President Obama our infrastructure   is like that of a third-world country   the homicide rate last year experienced   the biggest single year increase in more   than 45 years does anybody know the   biggest increase in homicide in 45 years   our police are underfunded understaffed   and under supported and Hillary Clinton   basically accuses our police of all   being racist   our border is wide open and drugs and   criminal cartels are pouring into our   country on an hourly basis thousands of   refugees are being admitted with no way   to screen them and are instantly made   eligible for welfare and free health   care even as our own veterans are great   great veterans died while they're   waiting on line for medical care that   they desperately need our veterans will   be taken care of like they've never been   taken care of this world   do we have some veterans in the group   stand up stand up Vettel's Wow   we have such tremendous support from the   veterans group from law enforcement   veterans groups from all over the   country we just had the endorsement from   the Fraternal Order of Police which   represents massive amounts of police   almost every Police group almost every   veteran group and then I saw today I   left the room and I saw a commercial   where it was really a nasty commercial   totally made up about me with vets there   is nobody that loves the vets more or   respects the vets more they're spending   hundreds of millions of dollars on false   commercials and it's a disgrace so what   we'll do I guess we'll sue them let's   sue them right that's really   unbelievable   they say let's see where's Trump doing   well he's doing well with the vet so   let's do a commercial on the debts and   whatever's unpopular they'll just put it   in let me tell you we're going to take   care of our vets like you've never been   taken care of before remember though our   annual trade deficit with the world is   nearly listen to this eight hundred   billion dollars a year you say who's   negotiating our deals right we have   political hacks negotiating our deals   and we have the greatest business people   in the world in our country why aren't   we using them eight hundred billion   dollars a year in Trey the federal   budget is a total disaster our state   department mostly under the watch of   crooked Hillary Clinton misplaced or   lost six billion dollars in can you   imagine this they lost you know you lose   a couple of bucks they lost six billion   dollars in taxpayer funds   we have the worst so-called recovery by   far since the Great Depression we're a   nation totally divided with race riots   in the streets our college students   graduate loaded with debt only to   discover they can't find jobs or   certainly not the jobs they want or not   the jobs they were trained for and   worked so hard to get those jobs have   left our allies aren't paying their fair   share foreign countries like Russia and   China do not respect us ever see Hillary   Clinton which he wants to talk tough   about Putin they say Donald Trump loves   food I don't love I don't hate we'll see   how it works we'll see maybe we'll have   a good relationship maybe we'll have a   horrible relationship maybe we'll have a   relationship right in the middle I can't   say this if we got along with Russia and   Russia one out with us and knock the   hell out of Isis that's ok with me folks   that's ok with me   so our taxpayers and us all of us as   citizens are sending troops and foreign   aid all over the world even as their own   cities can't provide the most basic   services we go to some of these Middle   Eastern locations and we'll build a   school and they blow it up and we build   it again and they blow it up but when we   want to school here or in Brooklyn New   York or in Los Angeles or someplace else   we don't have the funds we've spent six   trillion dollars in the Middle East   think of that we could have rebuilt our   country twice if we knew what the hell   we were doing and we're not respected at   all America needs a turnaround America   needs to come back America needs a   change and that's why I'm running   [Applause]   ok   uh november eight we're going to show   the whole world that America is back   bigger and better and stronger than ever   ever ever before stronger than ever   before first we're going to repeal and   replace the disaster known as Obamacare   President Obama said if you like your   doctor you can keep your doctor that was   a lie he promised his plan would reduce   premiums by two thousand five hundred   dollars per person that was a lie   instead they surged too much more than   five thousand dollars and you know it   because you're all here you're all   witnesses now it happens yesterday right   Bill Clinton yesterday oh they're so   angry Adam they scolded him yesterday he   was scolded did everybody hear what   happened yesterday and this is what I've   been saying for years so Bill Clinton   torched President Obama's signature   legislation remember Hillary Clinton   called Obamacare one of the greatest   accomplishments a president obama of the   Democratic Party and of our country   itself right but bill had a different   view he said it's just a crazy system   and that's the way he said it it's that   craziest thing in the whole world then   he went on to say well why people out   there are busting it true they're   working like hell they're busting it   sometimes 60 hours a week and wind up   with their premiums doubled and their   coverage cut and a half this is Bill   Clinton the people are getting killed he   said in this deal and small business   people and individuals who make just a   bit too much money to get these   subsidies you know what happens they   don't get anything they get nothing   Clinton at it it doesn't may   any sense the insurance model just   doesn't work so you know they're always   telling me oh if you say sup just   apologize just apologize I think that   President Obama should apologize for   obamacare   and I think that Hillary Clinton should   apologize for pursuing Obamacare and she   wants to make it even worse than it is   right now we're going to repeal it and   we're going to replace it with much less   expensive and much better care and this   is essential for your great state and my   great state because Obamacare the   majority of the counties in your state   have only one insurer to choose from did   you read that this morning in your good   paper good paper owned by a great guy   Sheldon Sheldon Sheldon Adelson and a   great supporter of Israel Sheldon   Adelson great supporter there's only one   way to stop Obamacare vote for Donald J   Trump very simple crazy very simple   it's a very simple way to do it you got   to get out there november eighth I say   kiddingly but I mean it I don't care how   sick you are I don't care if you just   came back from the doctor and he gave   you the worst possible prognosis meaning   it's over you won't be around in two   weeks doesn't matter hang out til   november eighth get out and vote and   then all we're going to say is we love   you and we will remember you always get   out and vote and don't let the other   side take this election away from us   because this is the last chance we get   and I see Elvis back there Elvis this is   the last chance we get the deadline to   register to vote is October eighth and   you stay so you could do that early this   way you don't have to wait around till   november eighth if you're the person   seeing the doctor right now we have all   great healthy people you have to be   healthy because Obamacare does it works   you haven't you really have no choice   that's the only thing good about   Obamacare is you have to maintain your   health which is good psychologically to   think that way because Obamacare will   not be there it's a disaster early   voting begins on the twenty-second   fixing our trade deals will be the   foundation of our economic revival China   Japan and Europe are printing huge sums   of money the devaluation of currencies   is staggering as to what it represents   to our country our businesses our   citizens and our jobs every time we   start making progress china d values its   currency and we go right back to the   drawing board because you can't compete   against   it's cheating we're not on a level   playing field and our politicians don't   understand what's going on they really   don't get it and the ones that do get it   are taken care of with political   contribution so they close their eyes   we're going to do something much   different and I'm spending my own money   on my campaign I'll tell you I'm   spending a fortune one of the very big   pundits were very respected actually   very liberal said you know what you've   done has never been done before and it   makes no difference if you win or lose   this movement that will go down in   history I said no you don't understand   I'd like to agree with you but if I   don't win this will be the greatest   waste of time money and energy in my   lifetime by a factor of a hundred   because if we don't win we can't change   things we can't bring back common sense   we can't strengthen our military which   is so depleted we can't save our Second   Amendment so many different things so we   have to win we have to win our jobs are   being lost in massive numbers and we're   not making things relatively speaking in   America anymore too much is being made   in other countries when I'm president we   will start making things in America   again   our nation has lost one third of its   manufacturing jobs since bill clinton   signed nafta you know was Clinton   designed a lot of people don't know that   one of the worst trade deals in the   history of the world the deal was also   supported very strongly by Hillary   Clinton Hillary's Korea deal South Korea   cost us another hundred thousand jobs   remember that it was supposed to be a   good deal it cost us jobs tremendous   numbers of jobs and South Korea like   almost every other country is laughing   at how stupid we are since China entered   the World Trade Organization another   bill and hillary back deal seventy   thousand factories when I saw 70,000 I   said please go back it can't be possible   can't beep I think it may be seven   hundred seven thousand seventy thousand   factories have shut down or left the   United States can you believe this   70,000 that's 15 factory's closing a day   on average we are living through the   greatest job theft in the history of the   world our jobs are being stolen by   countries with much smarter leadership   than ours not going to happen anymore   folks not gonna happen anymore   as the factories leave our money leaves   with them stores closed schools suffer   the tax base arose wages fall and the   quality of life totally declines real   cash wages from many workers today are   lower than they were in 1973 I usually   say 18 years but it goes back much   further people think of this people are   working harder today they have sometimes   two or three jobs then they were I'll   just stay with the 80th this is 1973 18   years so they made more money 18 years   ago than they may take their younger   they are less experienced today they   work harder they're older and they make   less money now the only thing I can say   to make you feel better is I'm also   older and I'm also working the hardest   I've ever worked in my life doing this   is the hardest I've ever worked in my   life so that's true this is work   although it's like love but it's work   but we're getting there we're gonna make   America great again it's gonna be worth   it okay   [Music]   we've rebuilt other countries at the   expense of our own skyscrapers going up   in Beijing while plants and factories   crumbled and the United says companies   like carrier General Electric motorola   Mattel Fiat Chrysler and so many others   I could go by the hundreds are moving   their jobs to Mexico and other countries   and now fort has announced two weeks ago   it's moving all of its small car   production to Mexico on top of the   massive plant that they announced three   years ago that's going to cost two   billion dollars that's now complete and   then you wonder why we're doing well in   Michigan and Ohio because I've been   saying this for five years I haven't   been saying this for the last two weeks   like Hillary who doesn't know what's   happening I've been saying this for five   years and the people of Michigan know   that and the people of Ohio know that   and that's why we're way up in Ohio and   that's why we're doing so well in   Michigan a state that normally a   Republican wouldn't do that well but   they're losing all their jobs to Mexico   and other places we're going to read it   go well you ready for this one folks   we're going to renegotiate NAFTA   and if we don't get the deal we want we   will withdraw from NAFTA and start all   over again making better deals for our   workers it's going to be America first   it's America first no more like let's   take care of everybody else except   ourselves   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   we're also going to stand up to foreign   currency manipulation and apply tariffs   and taxes to the countries that cheat   that way we neutralize that way our   businesses can compete and we won't lose   our jobs we will also stop the   trans-pacific partnership the deal she   called the gold standard Hillary Clinton   said and then during the debate she lied   and she said I never said that and then   they actually fact checked her and they   said Trump was right finally I'm right   finally   every time I made a statement this   character challenged me she can say   whatever she want say are you going to   check that salmon so they checked this   apron she called it the gold set and let   me tell you TPP will be almost as bad as   NAFTA nothing's like NAFTA but it'll   take your jobs out of your state it'll   take them out of Ohio and Michigan and   Pennsylvania TPP is a disaster and they   don't cover currency manipulation   because our politicians didn't want to   put the necessary language into the   documents and the documents are over   5,000 pages long and nobody from our   country practically has even read them   don't let it happen and if I win forget   it and we're going to have trade but   instead of having trade deals with all   of these different countries that's so   complicated will do trade one on one   1111 and if they don't treat us right we   send them a letter of default and by the   time that letter of default and now you   can't do that because you've got to go   through all this looks like a jigsaw   puzzle the backers of the TPP have   donated heavily to Hillary Clinton and   their wishes her command she's an   insider fighting only for herself and   for her donors I'm an outsider fighting   for you that's what I'm doing this for   we will stop the foreign cheating the   product dumping and the one-sided trade   deals this stuff will not happen anymore   folks we're not going to have a country   left with lower taxes on American   businesses from thirty five percent to   fifteen percent and many small   businesses will file as individuals and   pay only twelve percent a massive tax   cut   on top of that we will have the largest   regulatory reform in American history   our regulations are a disaster they're   putting businesses out of business our   tax trade energy and regulatory reforms   will help us reach four percent growth   and create at least 25 million new jobs   within a decade America will become the   great jobs magnet of the world and I   will be the greatest jobs president that   God ever created I tell you that that   will happen that will happen factories   will come rushing in our schools and   communities will be revitalized and our   poorest citizens will get new jobs and   higher pay and new hope for their life   but to be a rich nation we must also be   a secure nation security begins at the   border you understand any government   that does not protect its own people is   a government unworthy and unfit to lead   countless Americans who have died in   recent years would be alive today if not   for the open border policies of Hillary   Clinton and Barack Obama   this includes incredible Americans like   21 year old Sarah root unbelievable   person the man who killed her arrived at   the border entered federal custody and   then was released immediately into the   u.s. community under the immigration   policies of Obama Clinton he was   released again and again after crime and   now he's at large Sarah graduated from   college with a 4.0 grade-point index   number one in her class the day before   she was viciously killed also among the   victims of the obama-clinton open border   policies was grant rana Beck a 21   year-old convenience store clerk from   Mesa Arizona he was murdered by an   illegal immigrant gang member previously   convicted of burglary who had also been   released from federal custody then   there's the case of 90 year old Earl   Orlando who was brutally beaten and left   to bleed to death in his home the   perpetrators were illegal immigrants   with criminal records a mile long but   who did not meet the Obama   administration's priority for removal in   California 64 year old Air Force veteran   Marilyn Ferris was sexually assaulted   and beaten to death with a hammer her   killer had been arrested on multiple   occasions but for whatever reason was   never deported also in California my   good friend great guy Jameel Shah lost   his amazing son at age 17 he was   viciously shot and killed by an illegal   immigrant for no reason whatsoever the   killer had three gun charges as well as   battery of police officers prior to the   shooting   but he had not been deported they just   didn't want to do it I'd like to invite   up to the stage now some of the families   from the incredible remembrance project

Trump god bless you   [Music]   [Applause]   amazing and a story after story and it's   this is just a small group of the people   but I tell them every time I'm with them   I say your loved ones will not have died   in vain you know what I mean incredible   people the remembrance okay it's   incredible people it's a tough thing to   go through there are more than two   million criminal aliens with criminal   convictions in the country right now and   more who have committed crimes you   wouldn't believe it but who have escaped   the law entirely when I'm president we   are getting them out of our country and   we're getting them out immediately   quickly fast and a lot of the countries   from where they came won't take them   back they don't want to back their   killers there this there that we don't   want him back and under Hillary Clinton   State Department she said oh they won't   take them back under a trump   administration I promise you every   single one of them will be taken back   gladly gladly okay gladden they don't   want to take them back so they're on our   streets killing people all Americans   living lawfully in this country   including millions of wonderful   patriotic hard-working immigrants are   entitled to have their jobs and wages   and their security totally protected the   borders around our nation or for the   benefit of all people living here today   everybody and those borders are erased   it's often done by the lawful immigrants   already here and if you look at what's   going on with the borders and very   simply if they are erased and if we have   no borders we really have no country and   that's really what's happened and I have   to tell you I've been endorsed by the   Border Patrol agent 16,500   by ice two days ago ice first time   they've ever endorsed anybody for   president I was endorsed by Sheriff Joe   Sheriff Joe knows the border he knows   the border we love Sheriff Joe at the   same time our country is being   infiltrated by terrorists just two days   ago an immigrant from Bangladesh was   charged and yet another Isis plot   hundreds of immigrants from high-risk   regions have been implicated in   terrorism inside the United States since   nine eleven the terrorists who planted   the bombs in new york and new jersey   last with and who carried out the mall   stabbing in minnesota two weeks ago were   foreign nationals admitted into our   country as was the mall shooter in   washington state no more folks no more   now the media doesn't want to talk about   this they really don't just like they   don't want to show the crowd just like   they don't want to show   they never want to show the crowd   [Applause]   never ever   you ever go home and you watch and you   hear this roar sounds like you're at   Ohio State football game so you know   there's thousands and thousands we were   yesterday in Arizona we had a line that   was a mile and a half long trying to get   in it's incredible we were in Colorado   the day before we had a lot you wouldn't   believe the stadium's we fill up the   arenas that we fill up and they never   take the camera off my face never people   say how was the crowd I said didn't you   see all I loved your speech but didn't   you see the crowd and I heard but they   never ever show the crowd and that's for   good reason they don't want to show the   crowds because nobody's ever had crowds   like this and it's not me it's you this   is a movement like never before remember   and believe me the media which is   totally dishonest is a big big part of   the problem that our country is having   these are really dishonest people you   watch the Clinton news network CNN it's   a joke it's actually a joke   it's a joke and I think most people are   starting to understand it the good news   their ratings are being the Boston   bombers were here on asylum the San   Bernardino shooter was here through a   fiance visa sounds so nice doesn't   fiance visa huh coming in to get married   from Saudi Arabia right came in probably   radicalized him when out killed 14   people that shortly before gave them a   party honoring their new child shot him   killed him many wounded the Orlando   shooter was the son of a Taliban   supporter from Afghanistan I'm going to   keep the terrorists out of our country   not going to have them   Hillary Clinton wants a five hundred and   fifty percent increase in Syrian   refugees   she's for open borders remember this I'm   not running to be President of the world   I'm running to be President of the   United States and we're all going to   protect each other   and we are going to make I say it again   and I'll say it again and again we are   going to make America first again   remember that America first we're going   to make America for we're going to build   the wall and we're going to enforce our   laws and we're going to keep our people   safe I have a simple message for the   cartels the gang members the

country   we're also going to end government   corruption Hillary Clinton put her   emails on an illegal secret server open   too far and hacking   then she bleached and deleted 33,000   emails after getting a congressional   subpoena you can't even do that in the   private case she lied to Congress under   oath and her staffers took the Fifth   Amendment and got immunity deals   [Applause]   now we've learned that the FBI made a   side deal with clinton's top aides that   it was okay for them to destroy their   laptops you believe this   Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a   criminal enterprise and the only way to   deliver justice is to mail in your   ballots go out there get them done   November a get in we're also wigan it   we're going to end this folks we're   going to it we

homicides are up nearly   fifty percent in Washington DC and more   than sixty percent in Baltimore the   Democrats like Hillary Clinton have run   the inner cities for 50 60 70 even a   hundred years

President Obama promised the American   people that his plan would be affordable   instead health insurance premiums are   going through the roof and companies are   being driven out of business totally out   of business many companies are being   forced to flee the country they're   leaving our country they're creating   jobs in other countries instead and now   Hillary Clinton wants to double down and   make Obamacare bigger and worse and much   more expensive and it doesn't get any   more expensive Obamacare is now   unaffordable and so on the floor   affordable that even the Democrats are   admitting it just this month the   Democratic governor of Minnesota said   the reality is the Affordable Care Act   is no longer affordable and Bill Clinton   who had a rough evening that evening   called Obamacare the craziest thing in   the world he said that small businesses   and middle-class Americans are getting   killed and he was telling the truth this   election is our one chance to get rid of   Obamacare and the cost of Obamacare it   doesn't work and it's too expensive your   jobs will come back under a trump   administration your incomes will go up   under a trump administration your taxes   will go way way down under a trump   administration   and Hillary Clinton is raising your   taxes your companies won't be leaving   Virginia under a trump administration   they'll be staying we will be a strong   nation again we're going to rebuild the   depleted military we have the greatest   people on earth but our military is   depleted with the equipment we're using   and other things we are going to totally   rebuild our military we are going to   start with the Navy right here in   Virginia Beach as part of our plan to   create a 350 ship fleet little creek and   Naval Air Station Oceana are going to   get a lot busier when I'm president get   ready how many people are from there how   many people do we have that's a lot of   people norfolk naval shipyard is to   watch they're going to get very busy   folks get ready they're going to be   right at the center of the action of the   building of new ships when it comes to   the military i believe in three very   very important words peace through   strength   but we also need smart strategy   WikiLeaks shows that John Podesta said   of Hillary she has bad instincts now we   knew that just look at her career one of   her closest ally said she doesn't seem   to know what to plan it and what planet   were living in look at her record she's   been there for 30 years and what has she   fixed nothing she unleash death   destruction and failure in every country   she touched in the Middle East Iraq   Libya Syria Iran Hillary's catastrophic   failures Unleashed Isis came right out   of the vacuum which is now on a campaign   of genocide against Christians in the   Middle East and all over the world I   mean think of what's happened think of   what's going on it started as a small   group of people and now Isis is in 32   countries under her watch and now you   hear that Hillary's going to do   something about Isis that's not going to   happen folks that's not going to happen   at home she failed on the economy and   she failed in upstate New York right now   our economy isn't growing at all we had   only around one percent growth last   quarter and a horrible jobs report on   Thursday I'm going to get us to a four   percent growth and maybe more than that   and create 25 million jobs over a   ten-year period   many workers are earning less today than   they were 18 years ago working harder   and longer and making less and they're   older but I'm working harder and longer   and I'm older too so I don't feel sorry   for you okay some of them are working   two and three jobs but still taking home   less money for them and their families   companies like carrier of firing their   workers and moving to Mexico Ford is   moving all of its small car production   divisions to Mexico when I'm president   if companies want to fire their workers   and leave for Mexico or other places   then we will charge them a thirty-five   percent tax when they want to ship their   new products back into the United States   and they won't be leaving very easily   [Music]   Hillary Clinton has raised countless   millions of dollars from big donors who   want to ship our jobs overseas and to   other countries you know that with that   money she's out spending our campaign in   some ways by fifty to one in ads we have   markets where it's fifty to one and   we're tied it's pretty good right our   campaign is going and taking on these   big donors and interestingly polls just   came out today we're we're leading in   three major polls leading nation wide so   it's   despite all of the wall street money   that's being spent against us and it's   going to take on and we're going to take   on the big donors we're going to take on   big bonus and I'll tell you what the big   business in this country and I'm a part   of it but I decided I'd been on the   other side you do know that right I   understand the other side it's a very   easy side to be on and I've been there a   long time and I looked out and I said if   I'm going to stay there i will tell you   our country is in big trouble our   country's in trouble because it's the   wrong thing I love this country I didn't   need to do this I love this country and   that's why I'm doing it and we have a   movement going like they've never had   before   we have a movement going folks like   they've never seen before in this   country get out and vote though   otherwise the movement comes to an end   [Music]   thank you this is a great great movement   this is a movement seriously like they   have never seen before in this country   we are driving them crazy WikiLeaks even   shows the Clinton campaign speaking with   contempt about Catholics and   evangelicals and then boasting gleefully   about very friendly and malleable   reporters who shower the Clintons with   praise scenarios   our system is rigged and I've been   saying it for a long time and the best   evidence is that Hillary Clinton is even   allowed to run for the presidency of the   United States in the first place   [Music]   she lied to Congress under oath she lied   to the FBI and she made 13 phones   disappear some with a hammer did anybody   out there ever lose their phone with a   hammer and he will please raise your   hand nobody well but you are a great   group of people   by the way we have two of our great   generals three of our great generals and   we have right here right here general   Kellogg arisia Hendrick fellows ratio   and   and we have a man that you've never   heard of named Giuliani the mayor of   doing oh come on get over here Rudy   [Music]   great guy New York City was not doing   well and it was crime-infested and after   a year of Rudy it was starting to look   good and after two years boy what a   difference in to this day what a   difference he made he something great   job Rudy   [Applause]   she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails   and then two crucial boxes of email   evidence mysteriously went missing   [Music]   you know we have a four-star general who   is now got the potential to serve five   years in prison and pay a massive fine   this was two days ago for doing   something that was a tiny tiny fraction   of what took place with Hillary Clinton   and it's a sad day for this country   what's going on with her with the FBI   with the Department of Justice this is a   sad time in the United States believe me   and you all know it a trump   administration will end government   corruption we will also end economic   stagnation my plan for the economy can   be summed up in three very beautiful   words jobs jobs jobs   [Music]   at the center of my jobs plan will be   fixing our terrible trade deals 47   million Americans are in poverty and 45   million Americans are on food stamps   this is in our country 45 million we   have nearly an 800 billion dollar annual   trade deficit in goods with the World   Trade and the worst so-called recovery   since the Great Depression we also have   something else the murder rate in the   United States is the highest it's been   in 45 years Virginia has lost one in   three of its manufacturing jobs since   NAFTA signed by Clinton a deal that was   supported very strongly by Hillary we've   lost listen to this number seventy   thousand factories since china's entry   into the World Trade Organization   another bill and hillary back deal we're   living through the greatest jobs theft   in the history of the world that's what   it is the greatest jobs theft our jobs   are being taken out of our country and   they're going to other countries all   over the world we don't make anything   anymore on a relative basis we're going   to change that around we're going to   start making things again and it's going   to happen fast   [Applause]   a trump administration is going to   renegotiate NAFTA stand up too far and   cheating and stop the jobs from leaving   our country we're going to start making   things in America you're going to be so   proud of it as part of our plan to bring   back our jobs we're going to lower our   business tax from thirty five percent to   fifteen percent and our businesses will   start humming again   we're also going to rebuild our inner   cities for years and years and years   you've heard about this from the   Democrats they get the votes they don't   do a thing african-americans and   Hispanics living in the inner cities are   suffering the violence is unbearable you   walk to the store with your child and   you get shot there's no education   there's no jobs there's no safety nearly   3,500 people have been shot in Chicago   since the beginning of the year think of   that since January 3,500 people have   been shot that's as bad as and worse   than some of the war zones you're   reading about in the Middle East   homicides are up nearly fifty percent in   Washington DC and more than sixty   percent in Baltimore and it's getting   worse to the african-american and   Hispanic voters I say what do you have   to lose vote for Donald Trump I will fix   it it can't get worse I will fix it we   will be a rich nation once again but to   be the country and to be a country of   wealth we must also be a safe country   national security begins at the border   speaking in secret to a foreign bank   Hillary Clinton said her dream is for a   totally open trade there go your   businesses and open borders there goes   your country you lose your businesses in   your country anyone who supports open   borders can never be the president of   the United States you will not have a   country left   open borders would be the end of the   United States believe me as we know it   Hillary's plan includes an open border   with the Middle East meaning generations   of radicalism and terrorism spreading   and growing within our shores so let me   state this as clearly as I can if I'm   elected president of the United States I   am going to keep radical Islamic   terrorists the hell out of our country   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   we will also stop the crisis of illegal   immigration a trump administration will   secure and defend our borders and yes we   will build a wall and we will stop drugs   from pouring into our country   [Music]   we have the first-ever endorsement from   ice and our Border Patrol officers first   time they've ever endorsed the   presidential candidate and they're great   people they want to do their job they're   not being allowed to do their job as   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   allowed thousands of thousands I mean   all over thousands of criminal aliens to   be released because their home countries   wouldn't take them back think of it it   was just reported that a man deported   from our country ten times in six years   has been charged with raping a   twelve-year-old girl in August Texas   police arrested a serial illegal   immigrant rapist who had been deported   five times his victims included 1 68   year-old woman with a cane who took his   offer to have a drive to her home he   left her on the side of a dirt road in   horrible horrible condition a 64-year   old Air Force veteran Marilyn Ferris was   raped and beaten to death with a hammer   by a repeat offending criminal illegal   immigrant who should have been deported   under the Obama and administration but   never was should have been deported but   never was what kind of a government   allows its citizen and its citizens to   suffer like this and believe me there is   tremendous suffering going on we have   people from the remembrance project here   and you just have to look at remembrance   project these are amazing people these   are amazing people amazing people so   many so many and it's growing so fast   and that's a bad thing that's a bad   thing either we win this election or we   lose our country as we know it today a   victory in November will be a victory   for you the American people   [Music]   in closing here are some of the amazing   things we're going to do for our country   starting in 2017 we are going to have I   love you too   [Applause]   he sounds

every child living in   poverty I'm going to fight for every mom   and every dead who lost her child or his   child to illegal immigration and drugs   and gang violence and it's happening all   over I'm going to fight for every   community whose jobs and factories have   been ripped out of the states like   Virginia and shipped to other countries   we're going to fight for your jobs and   they have not done that for many many   years I'm going to fight for every   person in this country who believes   government should serve the people not   the dough   owners and not the special interest and   I'm going to fight to bring us all   together as Americans imagine what our   country could accomplish if we started   working together as one people under one   God saluting one American flag   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   well you're going to look back in ten   years in 20 years in 30 years and you   can look at this rally and you're going   to remember it for the rest of your life

country is   going to be a country that starts   winning again we don't win anymore when   was the last time we don't win against   Isis we don't win against anything look   at Mosul for years I've heard that's   where the ISIS leaders are they're   staying at Mosul so what do we do   instead of element of surprise what do   we do what a disaster what a disaster we   don't win anymore when not the smart   people because of our leadership we are   going to start winning again bigger and   better than ever before you're going to   look back at this election and say this   is by far the most important vote I've   ever cast for anyone at any time because   we started winning again and we started   winning with heart and remember the   words religious liberty that's a very   big part of winning that's a very very   impart of winning and our religious   liberty is being trampled on and we   can't let that happen we can't let that   happen so you're going to look back and   you're

righties and gentlemen please welcome   the next president of the United States   of America Donald J Trump   [Music]   thank you thank you everybody it is   great to be in North Carolina   really a special place I love it really   an amazing an amazing place and you know   we had a great primary victory here and   I'll tell you what it's been it's been a   wonderful experience we we've been   during the state all day I hear we're   leading in the polls in North Carolina   and come november eighth we are going to   win this state and we are going to win   back the White House   and when we do that we are going to   bring our jobs back to North Carolina   that i can tell you and we are going to   have a great victory for the people it's   going to be for the people so we have to   and we don't have any choice replace a   very failed and very corrupt   establishment with a new government that   serves you your family and your country   and that's going to happen Hillary   Clinton represents insiders she   represents the donors the politicians   the big banks the multinational   corporations and everybody getting rich   off a very rigged system and we know   that   she represents everyone responsible for   the decades-long squeezing of the middle   class the middle class in this country   has been treated so unfairly as jobs and   wealth moved to other countries like   Mexico and plenty of others Hillary   Clinton is the chief emissary for   globalism and I'm not running to be   President of the world I'm running to be   President of the United States   I'm running to represent America and   America first and America is going to   come first from now on it's no longer   going to be in second position Hillary   Clinton is the vessel for all of the   global special interests seeking to run   our government and our lives and it's   not going to happen anymore and what   we've done is we've created a movement   all over the country it's like this look   at these crowds look at the people   outside the thousands of people outside   look at what's going on all over the   country we've created a movement and the   people we are going to do and what we   have done for the people people are   energized now like they've never seen   before I think we're doing records it's   called in energy as opposed to some of   my opponents   and all of the people pushing the   disastrous trade deals all of these   people they're making a fortune in   Washington pushing trade deals that take   jobs away from North Carolina and all   these states those days are over the   jobs are coming back all of the people   they're just pushing everything but all   of the people they keep digging and   digging and digging this into a hall and   I'll tell you open borders we're going   to end you see what's happening with our   open borders that's all going to end the   people trying to rig our financial   system and our economy are the people   giving their money to Hillary Clinton   our campaign is about breaking up this   special interest monopoly I understand   special interest believe me we are going   to break up the monopoly of the donor   and the special interest we're trying to   disrupt the collusion between the   wealthy donors the large corporations   and the media executives all of whom   want to keep things exactly as they are   right now good system   and we know it's a rigged system all you   have to do is ask Bernie Sanders and   you'll see with his super delegates oh   they did a number on Bernie they did a   number and they're trying to game you   know we have a little debate coming up   very shortly right right so we had sort   of a forum the other night and that   worked out very well and Matt Lauer did   a very good job but by trying to hit   Matt they're trying to game the system   like game the ref and but I think Lester   Holt will be very fair but a lot of   people are going to be watching to see   if that's true the reason why so many   corporate newspapers and news anchors   are opposed to our movement is the same   reason why the lobbyists and the donors   are moving hello see now here's the   problem so i wouldn't pay the mic guy   right   to Mike your shot that was a weird sound   wasn't it so i wouldn't pay the Mike guy   and they'll say isn't that terrible he   didn't pay his bills when people don't   do a good job for me I don't pay him   it's one of those out of it   my father my father taught me that a   long time ago probably your parents told   you that anyway they're all part of the   same political system so they go to the   same restaurants they go to the same   conferences they have the same friends   and connections they write checks to the   same think tanks and produce exactly the   same reports it's a gravy train and it   just keeps flowing on november eighth   that special interest gravy train is   coming to a very abrupt end   the insiders in Washington and Wall   Street look down at the hard-working   people like you like so many people in   this state like so many people in this   country but you're the backbone of the   country and I understand that and you   understand that you are the people that   make the country run you are the heart   and soul of the nation and you don't   ever ever ever forget it don't ever   forget it folks Hillary Clinton lifted   the veil on this whole corrupt scheme   when she called you deplorable and   irredeemable   these insiders the political elites as   they say you see it okay you see it   they're supposed to be okay believe me I   like what we have together what we have   together is special what we have   together has never been together before   like it is right now in this nation's   history   and when we have rallies like this i   have to say we have rallies like this   and we have seven eight nine ten   thousand routinely those are like the   smaller crowds we were in pensacola the   other day we were no matter where we go   and hillary goes out for rallies and   yesterday i think she had 200 people she   had 200 people maybe 300 I'll say 300   because they'll say I was wrong what we   have folks is something special that's   why on november eighth you have to get   out and you have to vote but that's also   why on october 20th i believe you can go   early and you can do your balance and   you have to do it and you have to get   all your friends out because if we win   North Carolina we're up in Florida we're   up in Ohio we win North Carolina we're   winning we're gonna win so October 20   Clinton doesn't see you as people to   serve but subjects to rule over hello Oh   said Friend or Foe said friend   [Applause]   her friends see you as people who aren't   entitled to run this country or this   government and that's what they see they   don't want you or your family to have a   voice that's why I'm running I am your   voice I promise I will be the greatest   voice you've ever had   we'll bring our government back to the   people will break up the donor media   industrial complex because there is   nothing so dishonest as our media and   not everybody not everybody honestly not   everybody but a large portion of it and   it's very very unfair and it's bled this   country dry and that's given us all of   the problems combinations of different   groups all of the problems that we have   today Hillary Clinton is the last line   of defense for a failed political   establishment believe me and she does   not have you at heart all of their money   all of their hopes for another   generation a corruption all of the   corruption the tremendous corruption   that's what we have vested in her now I   will say we have just gotten some   reports and we're getting these   phenomenal poll numbers and they're   saying that our expenditures on   advertising our expenditures on people   our expenditures on everything are tiny   fraction and yet we r minimum tide and   we might probably actually be winning   expending a tiny fraction spending a   tiny fraction   now in the old days and for the business   people here of which we have many if you   spent less had fewer people did less   advertising and in one state i think   they said we did 150th 150th spent less   advertising and we're winning they used   to give you credit for that in our   country right now with this politics   they say well you should have more   people you should spend more money I'm   setting myself it doesn't work that way   if you can spend less and be winning   that's a positive thing right that's the   person you want as your president I   think the Clinton campaign exists for   one reason and that's to continue   rigging and look you know what's going   on you know what's going on it's rigging   the system just like she rigged the   system for her donors when she was   Secretary of State what happened   what happened when she was Secretary of   State was a total disgrace so her   conduct as Secretary of State giving all   of these special favors was something   like we have never seen in this country   before and then you can take a look at   emails you can take a look at all of the   things that happened all of the money   that was made all of the disgraceful   conduct its really Exhibit A against our   truly and I can't say corrupt system   because it's not a totally corrupt   system it's a system that's out of   control is it's a system it's just off   kilter we're going to put it back into   kilter folks we're going to make America   great again they're going to make it   quick we're going to make America great   now I have to tell you I have to tell   you a couple of things because this is a   group that likes jobs right we can we   can talk about Hillary Clinton for hours   we can talk about the rigged system we   can talk about the 33,000 emails that   were deleted we can talk about all of   the problems that our countries had you   look at her with Libya you look at her   with all of the different things look at   Isis Isis was formed in the vacuum that   she and Barack Obama created they   created this vacuum and Isis was formed   now she's telling us how to get rid of   Isis right I don't think so now I don't   know if you've heard but over the last   number of years she's wanted five   hundred and fifty percent more Syrian   refugees to come into the United States   two days ago two days ago President   Obama said and very strongly said that   he wants a hundred and twenty thousand   some vast number 120,000 to come in to   the United States look at the problems   we're having now look at the problems   that the world is having now look at   what's going on we can't allow it to   happen we can't allow it to happen and   it's not going to happen now what is   going to happen   what is going to happen and this is so   important and I just think it's one of   those things that we're going to see   because it's politics Hillary is all of   a sudden going to get tough the debate   comes and she'll say I want strong   borders I believe she meant the term   extreme vetting where did you hear   extreme vetting before only from me   because I made up the term I mean I came   up I said we need extreme vetting to   come into our country all of a sudden   all of a sudden she's got extreme   vetting and she's got all of these terms   folks it's not going to happen and the   reason it's not going to happen is   because their special interest donors   they like it when our businesses move   out because they owned businesses they   move to Mexico lots of this really lots   of advantages for them to do that no   advantage for our country no advantage   for our jobs so I'll give you a couple   of examples and I think it's horrible   ford motor company just announced that   they're moving their small car division   anybody here this to Mexico unbelievable   numbers of jobs tremendous numbers of   jobs and we're not going to let it   happen we're not going to let this we   lost in North Carolina you lost forty   four percent of your manufacturing NAFTA   has been a disaster for North Carolina   NAFTA has been a disaster for this   country you go to Pennsylvania you go to   Ohio you go to all of these states you   go to New York State you go to New   England look at what's happened to our   country we're not going to let it happen   any longer we're not going to let them   take our businesses any longer these   corrupt politicians we're not going to   let them take our businesses any longer   it's not going to happen okay it's not   going to happen   we won't let it happen now we have a   tremendous problem with immigration but   we have a tremendous problem with job   loss and we have a real problem with   good jobs because we're keeping jobs   they're bad jobs they consider we're   losing our good jobs so a couple of   examples you remember what happened in   Indiana recently with carrier air   conditioner right they fired all their   employees they said we're moving to   Mexico congratulations it was captured   this firing on somebody's beautiful cell   phone a great thing because if I didn't   see it in the cell phone it would have   meant that much and if other people   didn't and it happened to be just before   my primary in Indiana which I wanted a   landslide largely because of carrier so   so what happened what happened is they   let their employees go they're going to   move to Mexico tremendous I tell you   what tremendous advantages were given to   carrier to stay but they decided to fire   1400 people and go to Mexico they're   building a brand new plant and I wish   him well but here's the story folks this   could have been stopped years ago the   politicians didn't either understand it   or if they did understand that they   certainly didn't want to do it I   actually think it's a combination of   both but what's going to happen is the   following if we had somebody I would   love to do it myself but i'm not sure if   presidents is supposed to call up the   head of an air conditioning company to   explain to them why why they're not   going to do that but i'll tell you what   we are going to tell them in the nicest   of language mr. president of carrier i'm   sorry if you think you're going to leave   indiana indianapolis to be exact fire   all these people get rid of everybody we   have no income no taxes no nothing   you're going to move to mexico into a   brand new plan you're going to make   product you're going to make your air   conditioners sell them through our very   strong border because by the way we will   build the wall we   have   [Applause]   no no we're building the wall we can   have a very very strong border who is   going to pay for the wall do you even   have a doubt now do you have even do you   have even a doubt so what we're going to   do is we're going to tell carrier and   everybody I hate to use carrier only is   but eat there a perfect example they may   care conditions good air conditions i   used to buy my wall by many more but i   may but never buy an air conditioner   again if i win okay if I lose I may be   buying them a lot but I don't know this   is much more exciting than the real   estate business to be honest with but   we're going to tell them that look if   you move we are going to charge you   thirty-five percent every time you make   an air conditioner and think you're   going to sell it back into our country   okay thirty-five percent   and I'll tell you what will happen every   single time like ninety-eight percent   ninety-eight percent they're going to   say well let's go get a lobbyist now I'm   putting up my own money and I'm into   this thing for a lot of money folks okay   I'm putting up my own money I don't know   if it's ever happened I guess rustboro   put up his money but I'm putting up my   money I'm raising money from the small   donors and some larger donors going to   the Republican Party the RNC rights   purposes by the way doing a great job   but we're raising money for the   Republican Party but I am putting up   millions and millions and millions of   dollars so if you don't go out a vote   I'm going to feel very very foolish   shall tell you i'm going to say one of   the one of the pundits that it doesn't   matter whether he wins or loses what   he's done has been amazing it's never   been done before you know what I say to   that if I lose I wasted a lot of time   energy and money that's the way I look   at it I don't I don't view it the way   they look at it and and i will say it   has been an amazing experience but   here's what's going to happen we're   gonna say to them and i have the   greatest business people in the world   back in me carl icahn so many different   business people and well we have to use   our great business people we have to use   our great negotiators on trade and   they'll say look here's the story if you   move mr. carrier if you move it's fine   enjoy your new plant the weather's hot   but that's okay enjoy the new plan but   if you move there's going to be this tax   they're not going to move folks they're   not going to move they're going to say   well we're gonna stay now they'll stay   in Indiana they may come to North   Carolina all of that stuff is fine right   but they're not leaving our country so   easily we can't continue to be the   suckers that allow thousands of   companies millions of jobs to be lost by   moving their manufacturing plants and   factories to other country we can't do   it   we can't do we cannot do it so one of   two things is going to happen either   they're not moving they're staying in   Indiana or the United States and this   goes for many many companies there are   many companies right now in North   Carolina that are talking about moving   to Mexico and other places I hate to   tell you have a job you think you have a   good job you better get back immediately   stop listening to this the fact is you   have companies right now where you work   that are negotiating to move out of   North Carolina okay they're negotiating   to move out of different states and our   politicians do nothing about it and the   reason is two reasons number one they're   not very smart number two they're a lot   of times they're taken care of by donors   and special interests that want them to   move out to have reason to have them   move out especially when you can make   your product and sell it into the United   States with no tax no nothing so either   they're going to stay which most of them   will because the numbers don't work   anymore would have to pay that tax or   they're gonna leave it we're going to   make a fortune every time they sell   something into this country so it's ok I   don't care but we're not gonna have it   any longer we're our companies fire   everybody move to Mexico and other   places and then after all of that work   or we end up with unemployment and   nothing ok and they end up with great   jobs great factories a friend of mine   and you might have heard me say this but   it happened a month and a half ago he's   one of the biggest in the world at   building plants he builds plants big car   plants big all kinda plans that's all he   bills if you told him build an apartment   house he wouldn't maybe know how to do   it but he builds great plans and I said   to him how's business unbelievable   really that's good how is it I mean the   United States no not good here I said   what do you mean not good here said you   got to see Mexico we're building plants   he said to me Mexico is the eighth   wonder of the world it's going to be the   car capital of the world Michigan is   getting killed Ohio is getting killed a   lot of states are getting killed   including by the way north carolina   they're getting killed your jobs are   being moved your companies are move down   to Mexico and to other places but Mexico   in particular china is a disaster we   have a trade deficit with China five   hundred billion dollars a year trade   deficit by the way our trade deficit   with mexico is also massive its massive   but we have a five hundred billion   dollar trade deficit with china and let   me tell you something that's not going   to happen with me it's a two-way street   we got to remember it's not a one-way   street you know when boeing goes and   wants to sell planes to china they make   them build plants and after those plants   and I told this to the people in South   Carolina who I love but they have a big   Boeing complex but they're now building   a big Boeing complex in China when that   complex is built and they start   devaluing their currency and they start   playing around because their currency   manipulators like nobody that's ever   been there even better than Japan and   their prime and they start selling   airplanes at prices that this country   can't compete with I'll tell you why you   got to be careful but that's what's   happening right now when they when   Boeing made their deal with China China   took their intellectual property they   took so much and if they didn't take it   it wouldn't matter because they steal   intellectual property so I'm just saying   this I will be the greatest jobs   president that God ever created that I   can tell you that I can say   and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue   not even a club now when it comes to the   border and some of you have heard it and   some of you haven't who has heard the   snake how many people raise your hands   not too many so that's maybe ten percent   should i do it or should I not do huh   yes I'm going to do it I'll tell you   what to me i love it because it's so   descriptive not complex at all but it's   so totally descriptive we need strong   borders we can't have people coming into   this country who don't love our people   and love our country that's all and we   want people we want people to come into   our country we really do we want them to   come into our country but they have to   come in through a system and they have   to come in Legally right now they're   pouring across the borders you know I   was endorsed by the Border Patrol agent   16,500 agents they've never endorsed a   presidential candidate before ever   they've never endorsed the presidential   candidate they endorsed me I consider it   a great honor these are great people   that want to have a strong border   they're told to stand back let people   come and stand back we don't know what   we're doing and then to have the Syrians   come in who just today it was said they   really can't be vetted and I don't know   if anyone so i think was 868 people did   you see that they were scheduled for   deportation and instead of being   deported I don't know if they pressed   the wrong button or was there something   dishonest going on one of the other so   instead of being deported they became   citizens of the United States almost a   thousand people   that's yesterday they sort of hit the   jackpot didn't they they're going to be   deported something happened and they   became citizens of the United States   folks this could be the great Trojan   horse we have people coming into our   country we have no idea they're coming   in from the Middle East we have no idea   who they are I use the term extreme I   made it up now Hilary is copying it but   we need extreme venting but we don't   need anybody until we find out what's   going on from these regions of the world   and we want to help and we want to build   safe zones and we want to have other   people pay for the safe zones because   right now we have 20 trillion dollars   worth of debt it's going to be very   destructive unless somebody very very   good and very very smart and knows what   he in this case I have to say he there's   two of us is doing is doing but I will   tell you President Obama has doubled the   national debt so over 200 years of death   and in seven and a half years he's   double to think of it so we have almost   20 trillion dollars so we're going to   get Gulf states who are loaded up with   money loaded up with money we're going   to get the Gulf states to pay for safe   zones will lead the project like it's   called OPM I do that all the time in   physical other people's money there's   nothing like doing things with other   people's money because it takes the risk   you get a good chunk of it and it takes   to risk we're going to do this in this   case from a humanitarian standpoint OPM   other people's money will do safe zones   but we cannot have these people come   into the United States we don't know who   they are we know nothing about them you   saw what happened two days ago we cannot   continue these policies we have enough   problems in our country look at what   happened to Germany look at what's   happening in France we cannot allow this   to happen Hillary Clinton wants open   borders see   wants people to pour in Barack Obama   just approved over a hundred thousand   people three days ago to come into this   country from Syria we can't do this   folks we're not going to have a country   left okay and think about that and then   I'm going to read the stake how Wilson   years ago you wrote it it's actually a   song pretty cool song but the words for   what I'm talking about because we don't   know what we're doing but actually if   you sit down and think about it we know   what's going to happen and this is   what's going to happen if we keep   allowing these open borders and if we   keep taking in tens of thousands of   people that we frankly know nothing   about and your law enforcement will tell   you that they know nothing and there's   no real way to vet these people on her   way to work one morning down the path   along the lake a tender hearted woman   saw a poor half frozen snake his pretty   colored skin had been all frosted with   the do oh well she cried I'll take you   in and I'll take care of you take me you   know tender woman take me in for   heaven's sake take me in Oh tender woman   side the broken snake she wrapped him up   all cozy in a curvature of silk and then   laid him by the fireside with some honey   and some milk now she heard home from   work that night as soon as she arrived   she found that pretty snakes he taken in   had been revived take me a note and a   woman take me in for heaven's sake take   me in Oh tender woman cried the broken   snake now she clutched him to her bosom   you're so beautiful she cried but if I   hadn't brought you in by now surely you   might have died   now she stroked his pretty skin and then   she kissed him and held him tight but   instead of saying thank you that snake   gave her a vicious bite take me in Oh   tender woman take me in for heaven's   sake take me in Oh tender woman side the   vicious snake I saved you cried the   woman and you've bit me heavens why you   know your bite is poisonous and now I'm   going to die oh shut up silly woman said   the reptile with a grin you knew damn   well I took you in you knew damn well I   was a snake you knew everything about me   before you took me in very simple very   simple very very simple   very very simple very so we have a   situation where it's not so different   now let's go over a couple of things   because we have to repeal and we have to   replace Obamacare it's a disaster I   don't even have to talk about you know I   used to explain it and I used to say   that we have a really serious situation   where your premiums are going up your   deductibles are so high you never get to   use it the premiums are through the roof   the deductibles are so high it's a   disaster with repealing and replacing   we're going to take care of our vets   we're going to take care of our military   we are going to take care of our vets   we're going to appoint Supreme Court   justices that truly believe in our   Constitution okay big thing that's a big   thing we're going to get rid of common   core we're bringing education local   right   we are going to protect our Second   Amendment which is under siege go on to   protect   totally under siege and we're going to   protect it and the NRA these are great   people they endorsed me and I'll tell   you what between Supreme Court judges   Second Amendment Obamacare and then   obviously most important are depleted   military all of these things we have the   greatest people on earth in our military   but it's so depleted with the equipment   they're getting with all of the problems   they have we are going to rebuild our   military and we're going to take care of   our vets we have to   and lastly we have some of the worst   trade deals ever made headed by NAFTA   other countries have ripped us like   you've never seen before vast parcels of   land throughout our country including   this state are empty with fall and   buildings empty just empty when you see   it it's so sad you see buildings that   were vibrant 30 years ago and now those   companies are gone into other countries   in particular into Mexico and a lot of   them have closed because of what China   has done to us we are going to   renegotiate our trade deals with our   smartest and best business people those   deals those deals are going to be from   horrible job sucking deals to we're   going to reverse it we're going to have   a highway that goes in two directions   not in one direction out of the United   States we're losing our jobs we're   losing our taxes we're losing our money   and it's getting worse okay just so you   understand you think it's over it's   getting worse in fact it's getting worse   by far we are going to be a traitor   we're going to have free trade I believe   in free trade but we're going to make   great deals instead of horrible deals   because NAFTA and these horrible deals   that were signed by numerous people the   World Trade Organization disaster for us   the Korean trade deal you got to see   signed by and up wanted by Hillary   Clinton one of the worst deals I've ever   seen it was going to add hundreds of   thousands of jobs to the United States   instead it's the exact opposite and it's   been a great deal for South Korea it's   been a horrible deal a horrible deal for   the United States so we are going to   make our country so rich again and a   woman came up to me a wonderful woman   not so long ago she said you don't mr.   Trump I hate it when you're going to say   and you say it you're going to make our   country wealthy again or you're going to   make our country rich   and it doesn't sound nice i said well   you know it may not sound nice but   unless we do that we're not going to   have a country left we're not going to   have a country line so we have no choice   because we're going to save your social   security as you have it and we're going   to save lots of things that we have but   we have a country that's essentially a   debtor nation right now so we're going   to make our country wealthy again we're   going to make our country safe again   we're going to rebuild our inner cities   because our african-american communities   of Hillary Clinton is an example of it   she ran for the Senate in New York State   and she promised jobs that would be   unbelievable for New York State and   guess what happened the jobs didn't come   the jobs went the other way it went down   the absolute tubes it has been a   disaster ever since that's why upstate   New York she's going to do so badly   because she made promises that she's   going to bring hundreds of thousands of   jobs back and guess what happened it   went the other way it got worse and   worse they're worse it's just talk these   people politicians all talk no action   with the inner cities I say to the   african-american people that have to   suffer in these inner cities what do you   have to lose I'm going to fix it I'm   going to fix it I'm going to fix it   we're going to make it safe we're going   to help you schools a lot and we're   going to have choice because you need   choice if you're going to ever turn   education around in this country you   know we spend more per pupil than any   country in the world and yet we're down   at the bottom of the list so obviously   something's wrong so we're going to have   choice but I say what do you have to   lose I'm going to fix it and I'm telling   you we will get it done and we'll stop   spending money and taking care of all   these people that are coming into our   country illegally and we'll start   spending money where we have to spend it   okay we'll start spending so so we're   going to make our country wealthy again   and we're going to make our country   strong again our military will be   greatly enhanced and we're going to make   our country safe again and we are going   to make our country great again great   thank you god bless you thank you   everybody thank you thank you everybody   [Applause]   you   [Music]

that have been   shipped all over the world that have   been shipped to Mexico we are going to   bring back your jobs and we are not   going to allow these companies to go to   Mexico and other countries and take your   jobs with them we're going to stop the   jobs from leaving North Carolina we're   going to start making things again in   America we are going to make things   again   the jobs theft that's what it is we'll   end the day i start the presidency   believe me it's going to be america   first again remember that America furs   you don't hear that anymore it's not   America first now that we know that we   know early voting is underway so make   sure you get out and vote and by the way   north carolina we're doing really well   you see what's happening   the dishonest media back there they're   going what is happening they're seeing   the lines of people there seen crowds   like this look at this crowd now they   don't mention the crowds ever but they   see him they know what's going on they   look at Florida view seen Florida what's   going on   they have lines going to the voters   polls to the booths that are four blocks   long in Florida and they're an awful lot   of red hats and buttons and Trump shirts   and generally speaking those people do   not vote for crooked Hillary Clinton   [Music]   what group I love North Carolina you   know I have a great property near   Charlotte very successful that means I   play a lot of people I pay a lot of   employees but i'll tell you what we have   great people this is a great great state   and we're going to make it even better   we're bringing back your jobs   seventy-five percent of the american   people think our country's on the wrong   track that's an easy one to figure isn't   it we're going to fix it and we're going   to get our country back on the right   track and it's going to happen very   quickly real change begins with   immediately repealing and replacing the   disaster known as Obamacare   that one's not even close and Hilary   wants to double up and triple up what a   disgusting situation and it was no good   it was no good the day it was conceived   remember Jonathan Gruber of MIT he said   the American people is stupid to have   approved it unfortunately they had an   iphone going you know that's nice it has   just been announced that Americans are   going to experience another massive   double-digit spike in Obamacare premiums   including more than a one hundred and   eighteen percent increase for people in   the great state of Arizona so you think   you have it bad in Arizona they're up to   a hundred and eighteen percent don't   feel bad you're going to get yours to   your through the roof also but think of   it numerous places over a hundred   percent even Bill Clinton admitted that   Obamacare is quote the craziest thing in   the world where people lined up with   premiums doubled and their coverage cut   and a half job-killing Obamacare is just   one more way the system is rigged system   is rigged folks it's already   so when Gruber made that statement a lot   of things happened and a lot of people   started looking at Obamacare very   closely and i will tell you hillary   clinton came out and she wants to double   down and make it where she's good it's   going to be so much worse frankly can we   live another four years with another   obama i don't think so i don't think so   and I think she'll be worse and remember   the Supreme Court just put in the back   of your mind Supreme Court but we can't   take another four years of Obama and   that's what we're getting with Hillary   more than half a million North   Carolinians have been forced into   Obamacare they didn't want it they were   forced premiums have gone up in North   Carolina by double digits and this year   they're going to go up at a record   number it is catastrophic more than   250,000 people in North Carolina are   losing their health plans next year 95   of the state's 100 counties will only   have one insurance company to buy from   good luck in that negotiation folks they   are in a very good position hey who's   that terrier I want to know I want a   piece of that insurance company drain   the swamp look at that sign drain the   swamp and Washington DC look at that   you know I said to somebody the other   day and even today drain the swamp we   put it in about two days ago so drained   the swamp I didn't like it I didn't like   the expression drain the swamp in   Washington so I said it three days ago   the place went crazy I said you know   what I'm starting to like that   expression and now it's a hot expense   like trending all over the world drain   the swamp in Washington so we like we   like that expression Obamacare will   destroy the economy and health care of   North Carolina if we don't stop it fast   and I mean like immediately repealing   Obamacare and stopping Hillary Clinton's   health care takeover is one of the most   important reasons we must win on   november eighth we have to and next   we're going to rid Washington of   corruption it is Cora what about the   Hillary Clinton fiasco you ever seen   anything what about all the wiki lives   Hillary bleats listen to this we all   know but we're going to say because   nobody has ever gotten away with crimes   and I mean crimes like Hillary Clinton   has gotten away with   Hilary bleach and deleted 33,000 emails   after getting a subpoena she got a   subpoena from the United States Congress   she said whoa we have a problem she   deleted and bleached nobody bleaches   sophisticated people said we've never   heard of it you know why because it's   such an expensive process so she deleted   as she bleached 33,000 emails she lied   to Congress under oath she lied to the   FBI she made 13 phones disappear   somewhere the hammer who here has made   your phone disappear by hammering the   hell out of it oh we got to anybody else   I want to know sir what business are you   in where do you find out the business he   said and remember with the FBI she   couldn't remember 39 times all that   means 39 lives right she couldn't   remember 39 times you can remember other   things but not this the Clinton crew   gave more than six hundred and   seventy-five thousand dollars to the   wife of the deputy FBI director   overseeing the investigation into   Hillary's illegal server   that's all right leeme alone at so you   know the great thing about that we have   a protester by the way we you paid   $1,500 to be a thug where's the   protester where is he was he paid and   you can get him out get him out   [Applause]   out   Oh   folks did you see we're through   WikiLeaks we found out that Clinton was   paying people $1,500 plus an iphone to   go out and be violent at our rallies   okay it's a disgrace to disgrace but   I'll tell you what they found our people   of very tough they found that out   so we also found out that President   Obama in the emails knew about the   server even though he said he didn't   the criminal conduct of Hillary Clinton   threatens the foundations of our   democracy there has never ever been a   situation like this and the emails are   just a part of it we're going to turn it   all around I proposed a contract with   the American voter that will give the   government back to the people my   contract begins with a plan to end the   rampant government corruption and it is   corrupted she's perhaps the most corrupt   person ever to run for the office of   President she shouldn't be allowed to   run she shouldn't be allowed to run and   by the way remember just recently again   the emails WikiLeaks donna Brazile got   two questions for a debate got the   questions for a debate gave the   questions to Hillary Clinton donna   Brazile is under a lot of pressure   Hillary Clinton did she say oh gee I   illegally got the questions to the   debate call up and have a little   conference and say I'm sorry I'm a very   honest person I can't do this no they   only found out about it months later   you're dealing with a very very   dishonest person I want the entire   corrupt Washington establishment two   here and two here and to heed the words   I am about to say if we win a november   eighth we are going to Washington DC and   we are going to drain the swamp   [Applause]   that includes a constitutional amendment   to impose term limits on all members of   Congress   at the very core of my contract with the   American people as a plan to bring back   American jobs we've had it we're going   to bring back our jobs and you really   know what I'm talking about in North   Carolina because you're one of the   greatest victims of all we're living   through the greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world the greatest think   of that the greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world not just here look   at new england look at new york state   look at pennsylvania in ohio look   everywhere North Carolina has lost   nearly half of its manufacturing jobs   since NAFTA can you believe it half half   of your jobs a deal signed by Bill   Clinton and supported strongly by   crooked Hillary women at birth every   time you see a closed factory or wiped   out community the Clintons really did   this to you NAFTA was a disaster but   listen to this I always say it looked   like a typo they made a mistake it can't   be possible we've lost seventy thousand   factories now I thought they meant 700   factors maybe 7,000 we've lost seventy   thousand factories since China entered   the World Trade Organization another   bill and hillary backed disaster the   trade policies of Hillary Clinton have   been devastating for workers

  switch factory laid off up to 200 people   and move their jobs to Mexico in 2009   dell closed its plant in winston-salem   and laid off up to 1,000 employees and   move their jobs to Mexico and other   countries I have a friend who builds   plans he is i believe the biggest in the   world and i said how are we doing he   said Donald we're doing fine how is your   company unbelievable I said how's this   country our country the country we love   and he loves this country he's an   American how's it doing not good I said   well how are you doing well he said I am   building the greatest plans   anywhere in the world in Mexico I said   oh that's great that's wonderful folks   we're going to turn it around and it's   going to turn around so fast okay it's   going to turn around so fast on my   contract we will immediately bin and we   have to do this we have no choice and   it's going to be so much fun I love this   we will immediately begin renegotiating   NAFTA that has been a one-way highway   the money the jobs the plants the   factories leave our country we get   unemployment and drugs so we get the   drugs we get the unemployment they get   the cash the jobs the plants water   disgrace and you know what people don't   even know it's very complex but they're   under a vat tax system so it's about a   17 almost seventeen percent so what   happens is every time we make a deal   because we have a different system we   pay 17 they pay nothing so the agreement   has been defective for years and nobody   ever changed it that's why you never see   anybody coming the opposite where it's   always jobs moving to Mexico you never   see because it's a defective contract   they signed a defective contract just   there you're at a 17-point disadvantage   before all of the other disadvantages   kick in does that make sense it's a   defective contract and nobody did   anything about it for years Oh are we   going to do something about it it's   going to be done and I met as you know   two months ago I met with the President   of Mexico nice guy nice guy and we're   gonna have a very good relationship with   Mexico oh we're gonna build the wall   don't worry about this guy believe me   we're going to fill but we have to build   the wall we have to build the wall we've   got to stop the drugs from coming into   our country and poisoning our youth   we're going to build a wall one hundred   percent Mexico is going to pay for the   wall they don't know it yet but they're   going to pay for the wall political but   their leaders their politicians are   smarter and sharper than our politicians   we use people to negotiate our deals the   biggest deals in the world like with   China what China does to this country is   unbelievable we use political hacks to   do our negotiating they have the   smartest people they have like this   pyramid right from the time they're in   first grade they take the smartest the   smartest as well by the time they get to   the top you're dealing with very smart   people unfortunately they're not dealing   with very smart people and we have a   massive almost 500 billion dollar trade   deficit with China we have an 800   billion dollar trade deficit with the   world that's all going to end folks   we're going to have free trade but we're   going to have fair trade it's going to   be fair it's gonna be a two-way street   and with NAFTA we don't get the deal we   want we will terminate NAFTA and get a   much better deal for our workers and for   our companies 100% 100 whistle and if   companies like carrier want to fire   their workers move to Mexico or other   countries you know they're in   Indianapolis they fired all of their   workers and it was right around the time   of the primer and boy I'll tell you   those workers were great they followed   me they went to so many of our speeches   and remember that was going to be the   great firewall that was going to be   where they were going to stop Trump now   I had Bobby Knight helping me that's   awfully good in India   the great Bobby does but we won Indiana   in a landslide and by the way speaking   of Indiana Governor Mike Pence great guy   great great guy good choice it's an   important choice did we pick better than   her by the way I watched their debate   that one wasn't close and neither was   mine with Hillary that we've been hurt   badly we've been hurt badly and you saw   biting today right oh I'd like to get   I'd like to get Donald behind the gym oh   I dream about that kind of stuff you   know mr. tough guy he eats a real he's a   real tough guy for us I would dream   about that so they shipped their   products back into the United States see   he ought to be tough like that on trade   he would it be tough like that on so   many other things where we getting   ripped off he ought to be tough like   that in dealing with the Veterans   Administration because our veterans are   being treated so unfairly   [Applause]   so we'll put on a tariff and believe me   they're not moving then companies like   Apple will start making their iPhones   and other products inside the United   States you watch you want are you watch   everything's in China and Vietnam I mean   you know they say Apple isn't that   wonderful but they make everything   outside they will start making product   and so will other of our great country   we will get companies to make product   inside the United States would that be   nice and by the way no ship bingo this I   mean there are a lot of Avengers but   we're going to get it as part of our   plan to bring back American jobs we will   lower taxes on our businesses from   thirty five percent down to fifteen   percent going from the highest tax   nation in the world to one of the lowest   i'd like to make it the lowest but you   can only go so far maybe someday we will   be a rich nation once again we will put   so many people back to work but to be a   rich country we must also be a safe   country crooked Hillary Clinton   unleashed Isis and unleash death and   suffering across the Middle East and now   the terrorism is spreading into our   country she wants in her words to have   totally open borders which would destroy   America's middle class and by the way   destroy our country when you have open   borders you know 600,000 people could be   if you look at it the kind of numbers   that they're talking about millions more   african-american incredible workers will   be put out of work they are so badly   affected by the policies of Obama and   Clinton and I don't even know if they   realize what they're doing hillary wants   to increase Syrian refugees by five   hundred and fifty percent   coming into this country that's on top   of the thousands and thousands and   thousands already coming in and these   are people we have no idea who they are   where they come from believe me folks we   are not doing that the refugee plan   would leave us with generations of   terrorism radicalism and extremism   inside of our shores a trump   administration is going to suspend   immigration from terror aprende regions   of the world and will suspend the Syrian   refugee problem and let me state this as   clearly and nicely as I can if I'm   elected president I am going to keep   radical Islamic terrorists the hell out   of our country   [Applause]   i will also secure and defend the   borders of the united states and yes we   will build that wall that you're talking   about well also cancel all funding for   sanctuary cities horrible Hillary   strongly supports sanctuary cities like   the one that killed Kate Steinle San   Francisco thousands of Americans have   been killed by illegal immigrants in   january of last year grant thrown about   21 years old magnificent young man was   working at a convenience than Mesa   Arizona when he was viciously murdered   in cold blood shot point-blank by an   illegal immigrant with a long and   vicious criminal record people said   please don't let him into society they   did he killed grant violently another   American murdered in cold blood was 25   year old Spencer goal vac he was sitting   in his car at a stoplight after dropping   off his girlfriend on his way home an   illegal immigrant that a pickup truck   pulled up to him beside him and shot   Spencer directly in the head no warning   no talking no nothing no reason the   killer had a lengthy criminal record and   had been deported for x so many people   said don't let this man out get him back   to his country get him out of our   country the Obama administration refused   to do it I've spent a lot of time with   Spencer's mom Julie I have a message for   the cartels the drug dealers and the   gang members when I win your long reign   of crime and terror will come crashing   to an end   quickly and we have to pay tribute to   our great people in law enforcement   these are great people that are having a   hard time right now and they know where   these people are by the way when you   hear the gang members the drug lords all   of these they know they can tell you in   one minute who should go who doesn't   have to go they know we got some we got   some bad ones will also rebuild our   badly depleted military with the   greatest people in the world but we have   a badly depleted military and we can't   beat Isis can you imagine Mosul right   most i've been saying this for a long   time and you know somebody like Hillary   Clinton said well he says he doesn't   want to go into Mosul luck pups first of   all most it was already captioned it was   the way we got out of Iraq we shouldn't   have gone into Iraq and we shouldn't   have gotten out the way we got out but   that's why we're going in now second   time but why can't we do it like   secretly right why can't we do this   quietly I've been reading about we are   going to attack Mosul now and you have   to for three months and I'm saying you   know the element of surprise right all   right General George Patton the element   of surprise he didn't talk he got the   job done even after he got the job done   he didn't talk he didn't want to talk to   anybody the reporters wouldn't like him   very much use a little rough with   reporters you know these are the most   dishonest people I'm telling you these   are the most dishonest people on earth   and they are going crazy because they   put out these phony poles and then the   real polls come out so today Bloomberg   is appalled they're very disappointed   Trump is up in Florida by two points and   the lines are a lot more than two even   two points is forget it the lines are   through the room same things happening   here you see what's happening here the   lines the lines of beautiful beautiful   lines right it's happening all over the   country happening all over but they're   very dishonest people General George   Patton was rough he was a rough guy but   his people would die for him but he was   a great general he wouldn't give notice   we are going to Mosul in three months we   will attack we will attack and some   clown from some Institute came out today   why is Donald Trump saying that about   muscle hey folks i will put my thought   process against these people any time   he's saying it's okay the way they did   it well it's turning out I just saw it   on television it's turning out that   Mosul is very very tough to get and the   reason they wanted to get in is because   the leaders of Isis they felt were   living in Mosul but here's the thing   they were supposed to be the JV   according to Obama number they started   out as a little group a little band of   men this case men they started out as a   little band of men the JV became a   horrible horrible worldwide threat and   now they are ensconced in 32 nations and   then I hear Hillary Clinton who I call a   very low energy person   she's going out now she's going up and   saying what does Donald Trump know about   this look folks when you're looking to   take out the people that are leaders of   Isis and their ensconce and Mosul you   don't announce it three months before   you attack you used the element of   surprise and you knock the ah you say it   what's the word and you're not hell out   of them   [Applause]   boy oh boy what a bunch of amateurs we   have amateurs in the White House we have   amateurs as leaders and honestly I think   it's so there's so many things you get   whether it's the horrible trade deals   the loss of these jobs we have no growth   in this country you see that you see the   numbers are jobs numbers were announced   last week they were anemic anemic no   matter what we have our military's   depleted our vets aren't taken care of   we have stupid people leaving this   country there's stupid people you know   I'd like to use another word I went to   an Ivy League school I was a very good   student but there's nothing better than   the word stupid to describe these people   I mean there's just no better word i   know many words but we're going to   change that North Carolina will be a   major part of this rebuilding effort   with new advanced fighters flying from   seymour johnson air force base   [Applause]   [Music]   marine battalions at Camp Lejeune   [Applause]   and here's a place that a few of you may   have heard of and a very very beautiful   replenish storming out of Fort Bragg   [Applause]   North Carolina is also the home to more   than 750,000 veterans and I told you the   veterans are loving Donald Trump they do   polls on the veterans on through the   roof we're going to take care of our   veterans for once and for all well it's   not going to be talk we're going to take   care of our veterans our greatest people   we're going to give our veterans the   right to see their doctor of their   choice they're not going to be waiting   in line for nine days dying 22 suicides   a day these are all great people 22   think of that that's an impossible   number also to even conceive 22 suicides   a day they wait in line for four days   five days six days to see a doctor a   simple procedure or a simple   prescription could solve their problem   they don't get to see the doctor so they   could have the right if this happens to   walk across the street see a private   doctor go to a private hospital or   public hospital get themselves fixed up   and the United States will pay for the   bill and it's the cheapest thing we can   do and it's the best thing we can do   [Applause]   the veterans love Trump and drum loves   the veterans believe you better get out   and vote you better get out and vote   veterans because we're dealing with a   bad person we will also change our   foreign policy and by the way speaking   of the veterans she said the veterans   are being serviced just fine you know   that right she is going to do nothing   for the veterans and she's going to hurt   your social security big league but she   is going to do nothing for the veterans   Hillary Clinton gave us Isis and through   the middle east into turmoil do you   notice she gave us Isis she did her and   Obama now she's telling you I am going   to get rid of Isis what the hell did you   let him do this in the first place for   she's been there for 30 years it's all   talk with her nothing ever happens Libya   Syria New York State is a disaster she   said she was going to bring back jobs it   turned out to be just the opposite so   now she wants to start World War three   in Syria against the nuclear-armed   Russians great right you ever notice how   tough she talks about Putin somebody   said to me today very smart person great   business person called up and said you   know I heard her saying about Donald   Trump and Russia first I don't know   Putin have no business whatsoever with   Russia have nothing to do with Russian   and you know they liked us every time   WikiLeaks comes they say this is a   conspiracy between Donald Trump and   Russia give me a break you know number   one they don't even know it's Russia who   knows might be Russia could be China   could be if you remember Sony it could   be it could be North Korea could be a   lot of places but you know she always   likes her in the meantime she gave   Russia twenty percent of our Europe the   uranium right she gave him 20 percent of   our uranium you know what uranium is   used for for a massive payment and   Podesta has some big deal in Russia   and they always like to talk about Trump   but we learned a lot about them from   WikiLeaks we learned in the emails she   said and she has terrible terrible   instincts okay so John Podesta her top   person who I wouldn't want working for   man say he says so many bad things about   her who Minds you mind if any of your   people like you have Fattah Pia and you   have a person and they call you like not   a smart person your bad instincts you   don't know what you're doing I mean I   gotta have a couple of these but John   Podesta said terrible things about her   but one of the things he said that was   to me the words that she has bad   instincts so she's got bad it's things   from her top person Bernie Sanders says   she's bad judgment so who wants a   president with bad instincts and bad   judgment by the people that know them   the better what are we doing here all of   the following quotes come from I the   Podesta or call in Palo look he's   another guy he did a great job right   with Iraq there's a guy colon pal he did   a great job with a rat they wanted to   get away with it that was one of the   clothes they wanted to get away with it   you know the whole email scandal her   instincts are terrible apologies are   like her Achilles heel these are all   statements made about her she's totally   program she looked to program she has no   opinion sometimes that would be a good   thing in her case unbridled ambition and   greedy everything Hillary Rodham Clinton   touches she kind of screws up oh that's   wonderful that makes us feel good right   to all Americans I say it is time for   new leadership let's get the Clintons   out of our lives   [Applause]   everything will change in November just   think about what we can accomplish in   the first 100 days we are going to have   the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan   we will eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation which is   destroying our businesses we will   provide school choice and put an end to   common core we're going to bring   education local we will rebuild our very   depleted military and we will take care   of our vets we will support the men and   women of law enforcement we're going to   save is a big one for North Carolina   we're going to save our very very   troubled Second Amendment it is under   seas and we will appoint justices to the   United States Supreme Court who will   uphold and defend the Constitution of   the United States today I was in   Washington DC where I just finished   building this is before I started   running for president okay just so you   understand but I have a great grade the   best probably the best piece of land in   Washington one of the great pieces of   land the old post office and I'm very   proud of its great building we built it   into a hotel it's on Pennsylvania Avenue   right between the Capitol building and   the White House right smack in the   middle if you're in the real estate   business is an expression always try and   get the post office because they were   there first it's the best locate so it's   this incredible building and we had the   opening of Trump International Hotel now   I've been campaigning and you've seen   that in fact even the press is amazed   they are exhausted they follow me seven   stops eight stops five stops three or   four of these a day with crowds last   night we had 25,000 people in Florida we   had 19   thousand we had 12,000 we have the   biggest crowds because you know what we   have a movement like nobody has ever   seen before nobody the pundits Bill   O'Reilly but many of the pundits said   it's the greatest single greatest   political phenomena they've ever seen so   I built this building now you have to   understand I never practically go home I   work all the time Hillary goes makes a   little speech she reads your   teleprompter gets in a plane goes home   and start sleeping for three days so you   know what I thought I'd do my kids were   charged evanka Don and our good kids   they're good so I thought I'd take an   hour or two and run in and cut the   ribbon with them at the building to show   you how low she is she comes out and   says Donald Trump took time off from the   campaign to open a hotel up now she'll   do one stop I'm telling you she wants to   sleep all the time this is not what we   need this is not what we need as a   president she's a very low energy person   I saw it in the last debate I think she   did very poorly in the last debate and   then she was so exhausted she barely   made it to the car that's not what we   need to negotiate with China okay that's   all we did but she said I took time off   and I'm saying to myself this is that a   terrible thing where we're out working   her many many more subs many more   everything don't go home she's home all   the time she takes many days off and   then she said that then she said I used   illegal immigrants to build the building   except I didn't use one for two reasons   number what I didn't want to and number   2 i'm running for president why would I   would I do that so I went with the   e-verify system we didn't have one   illegal   immigrant on the job everybody knows it   nobody was hard and believe me we could   have hired plenty they're all over the   place they are all over the place and I   would have saved probably a lot of money   right but I have the e-verify system I   didn't hire one illegal immigrant to   build Trump International Hotel on   Pennsylvania view and then I see her and   then I see crooked Hillary said he used   illegal immigrants they will say   anything folks but the reason I did it   two things when you have good children   you have children good or bad you want   to support you children my children   worked very hard on that project I   wanted to be with them to cut the ribbon   but the other reason the other reason I   went there is because it was brought in   under budget and ahead of schedule   something this country never heard about   we have a hospital a VA hospital where   it was supposed to cost like 600 million   it's going to cost 1.4 billion but that   standard roads that cause double triple   quadruple bridges that are a desert   everything's a disaster so I went in and   I said you know what I'm going to do it   and we built it under budget ahead of   schedule and that was the name of the   news conference under budget and ahead   of schedule and we built a great hotel   and I wanted to be with my kids to   salute them and to congratulate them on   doing a great job I then flew in to   another great section of North Carolina   we had another great talk and we've had   a lot of fun but I just want to set the   record straight all eve arif I know   illegal immigrants no help in that   regard and we have a great thing and   including construction we put literally   thousands of people to work and that's a   great thing because that's what our   country needs but remember   under budget and ahead of schedule okay   so Americans are tired of being told   what we can do what we can't do and what   can't be done that's all we hear they're   tired of being asked to defer their   dreams to another day and to another   decade which is really what they mean   everywhere I go in this country all i   see is untapped potential waiting to be   set free and a great example of that is   the african-american community they've   been treated so unfairly so unfairly and   we're going to fix our inner cities   we're going to fix them african-american   communities Hispanic communities we're   going to work on the inner cities   because what Hilary and the groups have   done give me your vote give me your vote   and then after the election see you I'll   see you in four years that's all they do   we're going to fix our inner cities   we're going to bring jobs back to our   inner cities and safety back and   education back to our inner cities and   we're going to do great with the   african-american community we're going   to do great with a Hispanic community in   the election but we will never realize   that potential if we continue putting   our faith in a broken political system   that has let us down time and time again   let's close the history books on the   failures in Washington and let's open a   new chapter of success and prosperity   I'm asking all Americans to join me in   dreaming big remember what we used to   dream big we don't dream big anymore we   want big bold dreams for our future I'm   going to fight for every American in   every part of this nation I'm going to   fight for every person in this country   who believes government should serve the   people not the donors and not the   special intro   I'm going to fight to bring us together   as one great nation we are a divided   nation right now just imagine what our   country could accomplish if we started   working together as one people under one   God saluting one American flag just   think about once again we will have a   government of By and For the People   together we will make America wealthy   again together we will make America   strong again together we will make   America safe again and we will make   America great again thank you very much   thank you   Oh   [Music]   we are gone   I told me lose the day politely ha his   hair loss with joy   [Music]   Oh
Drn6YjPdKvE~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161003~Full Event: Donald Trump Speech on Cyber Security in Herndon, Virginia (10/3/2016)~133315.0~4.39200019836~848.0~152.0~   it's healthy for our country I believe   that's the weakness we've been seeing we   talked we got talk we've got spin but we   haven't had results Donald Trump is a   man who built his business empire on   making decisions and advancing real   buildings and real concrete structures   that I think we need that in in the   world that we were entered in today I   believe he can join and bring our team   together and provide leadership to them   we all know those of you who have   followed things closely that cyber   threats to America are great I think   it's important for him to share his   insights on that today now I think   you'll be impressed with it and he'll be   on sharing of that with us today and   continuing his efforts around the   country so ladies and gentlemen it is my   great pleasure and great honor to   introduce to you the next president of   the United States of America Donald J   Trump   [Music]   thank you everybody thank you   [Applause]   thank you   look at this what a response from our   greatest people thank you very much   thank you well at least I definitely   know the military likes from right   that's great it's your amazing people   are great people and I very much   appreciate it and speaking of that we   will have this week over 200 Admirals   and Generals endorsing Trump and that to   me is a fantastic honour in addition we   had 17 now we have 19 folks   Congressional Medal of Honor recipients   and to have that many is very unusual in   a tremendous honor I met many of them   over the last two weeks and that to me   is just a great honor so I want to thank   everybody I want to thank everybody in   this room then it's a privilege to be   here this morning with you so many   distinguished members of our services   and that's really what you are very very   highly distinguished members before we   get started we're going to have a cue a   little while I'd like to address one of   the most important aspects of America's   national security and that's cyber   security to truly make America safe we   must make cybersecurity a major priority   which I don't believe we're doing right   now for both government and the private   sector cyber theft is the fastest   growing crime in the United States by   far as president improving cybersecurity   will be an immediate and top priority   for my administration one of the very   first things i will do is to order a   thorough review of our cyber defenses   and weaknesses we have very substantial   weaknesses including all vital   infrastructure cyber attacks from   foreign governments especially China   Russia North Korea along with non-state   terrorist actors and organized criminal   groups constitute one of our most   critical national security concerns   they're learning everything   we don't want to have any servers in the   basements by the way folks does anybody   here has anybody in this group I know   our congressman hasn't done as anybody   put a server in that basement oh boy   Hillary Clinton's only Hillary Clinton's   only experience in cybersecurity   involves her criminal scheme to violate   federal law engineering and massive   cover-up and put in the entire nation in   harm's way the fact that a former   senator and Secretary of State claimed   not to know what the letter C means is   just one more example of why she is   totally unfit to hold the office of   President totally unfair   it's interesting that during her FBI   review which took place on a massive   holiday and which wasn't recorded and   lots of other things that she went 39   times she didn't remember she didn't   remember I says remember anything she   remembered practically nothing but which   has to remember something she remembers   it's a very sad situation i will tell   you i'm sure the folks in this room are   not thrilled the scope of our   cybersecurity problem is enormous our   government our businesses our trade   secrets and our citizens most sensitive   information are all facing constant   cyber attacks and reviews by the enemy   just consider some of these recent hacks   JP Morgan Chase massive bank had 73   million email stolen ebay was involved   and gave up 150 million passwords target   was attacked and gave up 40 million   credit card numbers attacks like these   are happening on a regular basis both in   the United States and around the world   and the costs in terms of privacy or   security and our financial sector are   truly extraordinary identity theft   financial loan as well as ransom and   ransomware we think of it all involving   extortion of a hacked institution are   becoming increasingly common and they   are extorting institutions incredibly   hackers were able to obtain at least 20   million identities of people who under   FBI background and were under FBI   background investigations the   information hack contains facts   discovered by the FBI and doing   background checks for people seeking   positions with the federal government   it's a treasure trove which can easily   be used for blackmail and other reasons   by the enemy the fact that this highly   classified information of very very   important people in many cases was so   poorly protected demonstrates that   cybersecurity is just one more area   where   Obama administration has failed and   speaking of failure when we do our   question and answer period you look at   what's happened with our Navy in terms   of the number of ships and our armed   forces generally how they're so depleted   how they're at almost record-setting   lows and in some cases absolute   record-setting loves it is very very   unfortunate and very very dangerous for   our country we should not let this be   like the history of the Mafia which was   allowed to grow into a nationwide   organization which infiltrated and   corrupted so many areas of society for   such a long period of time we can learn   from this history that when the   Department of Justice the FBI the DEA in   the state and local police and   prosecutors were combined in a task   force directed by and at the Mafia when   they looked at the Mafia and really went   after they were able to get great great   successes and prosecutions out of them   and seizing their business interest at a   lot of things including their business   interest taking them away and removing   their infiltration from legitimate areas   of society they've been very very   effective when everybody got together   does a long time ago as president I will   instruct the Department of Justice to   create a joint task force throughout the   United States to work together with   federal state and local law enforcement   authorities and international law   enforcement to crush this still   developing area of crime and it's   getting bigger very fast it's going to   be harder and harder to do I will make   certain that our military is the best in   the world in both cyber offense and   defense and in every other way by the   way every other way   we've rarely needed it more than we do   right now I will also ask my secretary   of defense and Joint Chiefs to present   recommendations for strengthening and   augmenting our cyber command as a   deterrent against the tax on our   critical resources the United States   must possess and hasten the unquestioned   capacity to launch crippling cyber   counter-attacks and I mean crippling   crippling this is the warfare of the   future America's dominance in this arena   must be unquestioned and today it's   totally questioned people don't even   know if we have the capability that   we're supposed to have when you look at   what's going on with other countries   cybersecurity is not only a question of   developing defensive technologies but   offensive technologies as well for non   state terror actors the United States   must develop the ability no matter how   difficult to track down and incapacitate   those responsible and do it rapidly we   should turn cyber warfare into one of   our greatest weapons against the   terrorists and they have to know it's   coming because right now they know   nothing about us it just seems they have   an open blanket it's like an open mark   do whatever you want to do nothing's   going to happen take our youth out of   the country infiltrate our country in so   many different ways we can't let this   happen we have to have it stopped   immediately before it's too late   to enhance the defense of the other   agencies of government including our law   enforcement agencies so important in   doing such a great job by the way we   will put together a team of our best   military civilian and private sector   cybersecurity experts to comprehensively   review all of our cyber security systems   and technologies to cyber review team   will proceed with the most sensitive   systems first but ultimately all systems   will be analyzed and made as secure as   modern technology permits and hopefully   that's going to be our technology we   will also require that follow-up reviews   take place on a regular basis determined   by the sensitive nature of the security   involved the review will be very much   exact and recommended by experts we want   experts our finest people we don't want   people that are be level c level d level   we have to get our absolute best and the   recommendations have to be a combination   of defensive technologies tailored to   specific agencies and every other   discipline involved this will include   the various methods of internal modern   monitor attack and penetration   investigation of success suspected   hackers or rogue employees and you have   plenty of rogue employees and identity   protection for government employees the   review team will also remain current on   the constantly evolving new methods of   attack and will attempt to anticipate   them and develop defenses as often as   possible before breaches occur and there   are ways of doing this through modern   technology but we are not using that and   frankly our technology is not up to date   we're letting it slip by and with   technology as we know it can go very   very rapidly this group of experts will   set up protocols for each agency and   government official   requiring them to follow best and   strongest practices they will also   establish a training program for all   government employees to make certain   that they understand what defenses are   available and utilize them along with a   continuing education program so everyone   is aware of the newest methods of both   attack and defense that means attack and   defense those who violate classification   rules will be held responsible to the   fullest extent of the law something   which we don't do too much   you know where our country lately were   more interested in protecting the   criminals than we are and making sure   that we're strong and powerful and know   what we're doing we're so so interested   in protecting criminals and people that   want to do us harm and I think we have   to go back to a little more   old-fashioned method of thinking that   makes sense I will appoint an attorney   general who will reform the Department   of Justice like it was necessary after   Watergate my attorney general will   restore the integrity of the Department   of Justice which has been severely   questioned today is just   frankly nobody's ever seen anything like   what's happening today when you have   somebody getting a subpoena from the   United States Congress to have your   emails and all other information sent   and after not before after getting the   subpoena 33,000 emails are deleted and   acid washed and nobody even knows what   that means a Squatch is a very expensive   thing to do most people don't even know   what it means when you see something   like that and there's no crime   everything's just wonderful you know if   you are in a private case with mr. Smith   then they call for your records and you   get rid of your records so blatantly is   this you have serious consequences like   the most serious consequence use the   congressman sends out a tremendous   subpoena they want to see the emails and   they delete the emails I can't think of   anything in terms of what we're talking   about much more serious than that   congressman do you agree so hard to   believe hard to believe that they can   get away with this kind of thing today   is just the beginning of a long and   overdue national discussion on how to   protect ourselves from modern cybercrime   and evolving national security threats   and how to develop the cyber offense   strategies necessary to gain a critical   security edge in the 21st century we   need the edge and ideally a big one I   want to thank everybody in this room I   have such respect for the people in this   room for being here and now let's begin   our discussion thank you very much folks   mr. Trump thank you so much for joining   us today and I know you are busy   traveling but I want to thank you for   taking the opportunity to have a   conversation with these American   warriors and I first want to thank   general Vernon Lewis whose idea was to   pull all of these leaders together we   want to thank him for his leadership but   before we begin mr. Trump I just want to   kind of give you an overview of who's in   this room we have gathered here warriors   from across America who have fought and   defended America and the ideals upon   which America is founded in every   conflict in war since World War two they   are in this room here today they have   retired and hung up their uniforms but   they have not retired from there   defending of their oath and that is to   defend the Constitution of the United   States against all enemies foreign and   domestic and they are here today in   service to their country and so with   that understanding that you have a room   full of warriors who are ready to report   for duty to defend this country we want   to begin with our questions in general   Boykin will recognize our first general   to ask a question well I'd like to say   thank you for being here as well our   first speaker it probably have seen more   combat than anybody else in the room   here because he's fought in three wars   it's general frederick or fritz crowson   he was in World War two Korea as well as   Vietnam he commanded everything from the   company to the core level and ultimately   earned three purple hearts and three   combat infantry badge as he is he had 34   * jobs he was commanding general forces   command the vice chief of staff of the   army and the commander-in-chief of the   United States Armed   europe general Croson your question sir   Thank You June click on is this on I'm   on Mr Trumper I only speak for the army   it's not because I ignore the needs of   the Air Force and the Navy but and I and   I accept everything you have said about   the cyber threat to us but my question   has to do with the United States Army   which has been too small ever since the   Cold War ended and we paid the peace   dividend out of the defense budget and   the army has been too small ever since   when we were committed into Iraq and   Afghanistan and the chief of staff of   the army was asked how many troops he   was going to need to finish that war and   he said about 300,000 he was made a   pariah and nobody asked for his advice   and counsel for the rest of his tour   duty we've been using that army for the   last 15 years and it's the first time we   ever went to war without expanding the   size of the army instead of that they   hired 200,000 civilian contractors to do   the work that the army wasn't big enough   to do now we have an army that's being   worn out we are losing experienced   soldiers who are being too left being   dismissed from the Army in order to   bring the size down even more now we   think the United States Army is going to   be a major element that you'll want to   use in your national strategy and we'd   like to know what your thoughts are on   how to go about this well general thank   you thank you for your bravery amazing   I've heard your name mentioned many   times so thank you for being here thank   to the question not only the army the   Navy the Air Force the Marines   everything is going away at a time when   certainly we are any top priority for   making sure that doesn't happen we're   not respected to the extent that we were   and we keep going like this we won't be   respected at all well you look at   Russia's doing with their nuclear   capability and the newness of their   capability and look at what we're doing   and nobody wants to do that with respect   to nukes because nukes are horrible but   you have countries that are going out of   their way to do things that we're not   doing and we have to be very very   careful the size of the army absolutely   it's getting too small in fact a certain   general when he left about a year and a   half ago said we are not only two small   with the least prepared that we've ever   been since he can remember the least   prepared so it's a combination of that   of both look I feel so strongly that I   use a different word in going around   that our forces are depleted their   depleted with the greatest people on   earth but they're depleted and you see   where the fighter jets are so old that   they can't get parts anymore they have   to go to plane airplane graveyards and   museums to get parts for our fighter   jets that we're currently using they   don't make the parts and you have other   countries that have brand-new equipment   and in some cases we sell them the   equipment the whole thing is ridiculous   now we're going to build up our forces   including the army but we are going to   build up our forces we have no choice   you know they can talk about sequester   they can talk about all of the different   things that they've they're doing but   this isn't like we have a choice this is   something we're and we're going to be   cutting elements of government circling   but when it comes to the military we   have no choice we cannot have it   deleted military we have to have the   strongest military before and with that   being said as you know we spend a lot of   money on protecting other countries and   yet those other countries aren't paying   nearly what it costs us for that   protection where they're getting one of   the great bargains of all time but we're   spending on numerous countries very   substantial countries you know the   countries were talking about but we're   defending them for a fraction of the   cost we to go to those countries that we   have to ask them to make contributions   that are greater than the contributions   they're making right now you know we're   going to protect them we're going to   remain loyal to them but at the same   time it's a two-way street they have to   help us also so I think your question is   a great one and we will build our   military forces to a level that will be   I believe stronger than ever before if I   become president the United States okay   thank you   earlier before you arrived we mentioned   today as anniversary of the Black Hawk   Down in Mogadishu and one of the   officers that was there that we   recognize is going to ask our second   question Major General Gary Harrell   general Harrell has had multiple tours   with the 82nd Airborne Division has been   on combat missions from Panama to savoia   he was the commander of US special   operations forces in sin calm and led   the 1st special forces into Afghanistan   he retired in 2008 from the United   States Army Special Operations Command   General Harold I love you yes sir the   Obama administration has yet to develop   a strategy for dealing with the global   jihad movement the terrorists are   motivated by a theology that drives him   to atrocities against non-believers be   they Christians Jews or other faiths   Americans have not been allowed to know   the enemy or call them by name we need a   strategy not a tactical plan what is   your plan to defeat radical Islam and   how will you reverse the strategic   confusion of the Obama era well it is   confusion not only there but it's   confusion in many other fields long   beyond military and defense the   country's confused in terms of even the   divide in our country if such divided   and really divides we have many   different forms of divide so there's a   lot of confusion but we have a president   that won't use the term radical Islamic   terrorism won't use it will spend low   periods of time explaining to people why   he won't use it at the end of the   explanation nobody knows why he still   won't use it because the explanation is   no good and I mean honestly we have a   president that in my opinion really   doesn't know what what he's doing we   have a president that that doesn't know   what's happening and when it comes to   the military you know I always said keep   the oil   I said don't go in but I said keep deal   had we kept the oil you wouldn't have   Isis because they feel their growth with   the oil but I read something and saw   something over the weekend that really   bothered me because I believe in I'm a   big fan of General Douglas MacArthur and   General George Patton you know these   great channel some of the generals big   fan of some of the generals in this room   we have that way of general Flynn is   with us general Kellogg we have a few   generals that have been so incredible to   me now we have 200 but generals and   admirals I'm never going to forget   Admirals right those ad plus I will   never forget the Admirals that I can   promise you but it was very   disconcerting when I saw that an attack   is planned of Mosul an attack his plant   and you know we're involved in the   attack but the Iraqi forces are planning   an attack on mosel it should happen over   a short period of time and the work will   be why do we have to talk about it why I   never saw anything like this every time   we're going to attack somebody we   explain will go to attack will be   attacking at three noon or march 25th I   don't know unless you disagree with me   wouldn't it be better if we were going   to go after mosel to not say anything   and do it as opposed to announcing   they're announcing all over television   they're planning to attack Moser and   whatever they asked me the question   about what are you going to do about   Isis I say you know I have a real chance   of winning I don't really want to tell   you I have very strong ideas and i'll be   dealing with the people in this roman   and other folks that are you know very   good at this but the last thing you want   to do is give notice to the enemy when   President Obama announced that he was   leaving Iraq Iraq I mean he was talking   about dates and times and what we're   going to do the enemy pulls back we   think we're doing well well they pulled   back they're not stupid and then after   we leave you see what happened so I just   I just want to say that we are going to   hit Isis hard and I mean really hard up   but I do think this   the American public doesn't have to know   the date and hour and second that we're   going to attack and from what side we're   going to attack we're going to attack   from the Eastern quadrant and it will   take place on a certain day of a certain   now we don't need to they just want to   see victory we don't have victory I mean   we're dropping our we're dropping things   all over the place who knows what   they're hitting who knows how many   people are being killed and who knows if   they're the right people but at some   point we have to stop a force that's   going out and drowning people in steel   cages and chopping off heads these are   barbaric people these are people that   you know I used to study medieval times   and you know that they jump to offense   but until recently this was a phenomena   that you wouldn't see that the level of   barbarism is unbelievable so we're going   to stop them we're going to stop them   cold witness happen very powerfully but   I don't think all of us should be other   the less it's a very confined room we   shouldn't be giving up our plans and it   bothers me every time I see where we're   planning to attack this one that one but   the one I saw over the weekend was mosel   and they're talking about attacking it   the other problem is you have a lot of   the leaders in muzzle well they're not   going to be there take any out because   they hear they're going to be attacked   so they're getting out there going   someplace Congress would you agree with   this if I'm a leader and I'm seeing and   I'm watching what everybody else is   watching and an attack on mosel is   imminent I'm saying bye folks have a   good time I'm moving into a different   city so what are they doing it can there   be a lad are we allowed to have any more   in the military general the element of   surprise you know I would think it would   be a good thing it's called an ancient   strength and we don't use it anymore in   front of World War I think it's one of   the great principles the element of   surprise I mean you can take a force   that's not nearly as strong and with the   element of surprise you can wipe out a   much more powerful force and I don't   pretend to be a general or an admiral   or anything else but I just every time i   see i see President Obama get up ladies   and gentlemen we are sending 50 people   to Iraq 50 so that's paid into its   number one it's such a low number that   the enemy's saying is that all and   number two when you think 50 those   people now have a target on their back   they want to find those 50 people and   they look for those 50 people when   Hillary Clinton says no boots on the   ground now whether you one puts on the   ground they're not you shouldn't say it   because you've just taken so she said   there will be no boots under but she's   very strong cuz politics you know it   sounds a little bit better to say no   boots on the ground but by doing that   she is empowered the enemy she's   empowered the enemy and I think she   possibly means it I'm not sure if she   means it or not but she says no boots   anyone she has taken a tremendous I mean   that's really giving strength to the   enemy and even if she felt that she   should never admit that she'd never   admit that you have to leave all your   options open and if you don't leave your   options open you're a fool and I hated   to hear her say that so   to summarize you're not going to send a   message about date and time but you are   going to send a message that their days   are numbered it is that a DS will be   numbered very quickly okay our third   question is asked by rear admiral Frank   Gallo animal Gallo is a retired naval   aviator with 35 years service he has   hundreds of carrier landings flew almost   every fixed-wing aircraft and a navy in   his time he's commanded a squadron wing   and fleet wing levels and he was chief   of naval personnel command for the   Department of the Navy at Mugello I mr.   Trump I'm happy you haven't forgotten   the Admirals of course and I hope you'll   pardon the remnant I don't have the   courage to do that and I hope you'll   pardon the remnants of a Brooklyn accent   yet Department of Veterans Affairs has a   horrible record of taking care of   veterans as you recall there was a there   were lengthy lines at VA hospitals   substandard medical care and falsified   medical records and accounting   leadership changes and new unrealistic   laws have failed to correct the problems   the VA is the most probably the most   ineffective bureaucracy in all of   Washington and it is time for drastic   action the question is with a near-daily   revelations that the US Department of   Veterans Affairs fails veterans in some   form or another what is your plan to   replant it to reform and fix the system   to ensure veterans can have timely   access and quality care for health care   services ok so first of all I want to   ask you one question you had all those   aircraft landings on the carrier's right   so canon otherwise excellent pilot the   very very good pilot because I've heard   that some just can't do this what   percentage of very very good pilots   cannot land on an aircraft carrier with   training any very good pilot can land on   a carrier after get the train after   training the training is marked because   I understand it's a very   very special talent it's a talent that   you acquire if you start off with the   basics okay very good see he puts it   down a little bit that's very good okay   that's very good I've heard it's very   very tough the Veterans Administration   is a disaster the VA it's a disaster I   have gotten to all over the country and   I've met so many veterans and I have   tremendous veteran support and I see   what those people are going through to   see a doctor sometimes it takes six and   seven days and then you finally get   there and the doctors gone on vacation   we have to change that whole system it   starts with management we have to have a   whole different set of protocols and we   have to get people off the lens you know   people are dying not only the 22   suicides a day which is inconceivable   when you hear that when I first heard   that I said no you mean a month I mean   can you imagine a day 22 suicide today a   lot of the suicide these people can't   get to see doctors a lot of it because   the weights are so long that's an   administrative problem and by the way   the VA has some great doctors I've been   told by some of the veterans the doctors   are great when you can get to see many   cases so we have a plan and it's been   put out on my website and people love it   if you can have a weight of six days   five days two days one day we're going   to give our great veterans the right to   go out go across the street to a private   doctor or a private hospital or public   house whatever happens to be in that   community without having to drive 400   miles to another hospital and we're   going to give them the right to see that   private doctor get taken care of perhaps   the private or public hospital get taken   care of quickly effectively and go about   their business and the government we are   going to pay the bill that will totally   reduce all of the waiting times all of   the problems and I think it may actually   get the VA to respond better to things   because you know there is a little   competition   would think but it's not like we have a   choice we can't let what's happened to   happen now I mean I've heard stories   that are so horrible I mean people are   killing themselves while they're waiting   on line because they can't you know they   know it's days and days before they can   have what could be a simple procedure   what could be a simple prescription they   have to wait so long as I end up they   can't take it they can't take it so   we're going to establish a procedure   where people can leave the line go   outside take care of themselves and the   government's going to pay and by the way   that's a far less expensive solution   then other various foolish solutions   I've heard the veterans love it they   love it but it's a far better solution   than anything anybody's heard and it's   common sense and it's there and the   doctors need the business and the   private hospitals and public hospitals   need the business and they're sitting   there waiting so we don't have a choice   we have to do that okay thank you   Thank You mr. Trump we're going to   transition to another set of issues one   that really has become a hallmark of   your campaign and that is challenging   the area of political correctness   Colonel done Bartholomew Bartholomew was   an adjutant general officer and former   commandant of the army AG school he is a   decorated combat veteran and he has our   next question colonel sir the US   military has been long successful   because of the Warrior Ethos that's part   of his DNA but under this administration   that ethos has been under attack in some   cases undermined by the forces of   political correctness the military has   become an institutional for social   experiments and as a result the military   has undergone a number of changes to   regulations with regard to women in   combat trans just transgender rights and   other issues none of these PC actions   were combat effective or readiness   driven in fact the opposite is happening   deployability readiness and morale are   all adversely effected affected so my   question to you is what will you do   about the social engineering and   political correctness that's been   imposed upon our military well we're   going to get away from political   correctness and we're going to have to   be like the whole concept of profiling   you know I mentioned the other day   profiling everyone goes all profile and   profiling well profiling is you know in   Israel they're doing it and they're   doing it well and we may have to do that   and we may have to do other things but   you're right we have a politically   correct military and it's getting more   and more politically correct every day   and a lot of the great people in this   room don't even understand how it's   possible to do that and that's through   intelligence not through ignorance   believe me because some of the things   that they're asking you to do and be   politically correct about are ridiculous   I will say I would leave many of the   decisions of some of the things you   mentioned to the generals he had most of   people on top and we get some of the the   congressman just mentioned to me and I   think it's true one hundred percent you   get your top enlisted people in that and   you have   discussions with some of these top   enlisted people who know it better than   probably anybody but get our military   people to come back and make   recommendations to me and I will follow   those recommendations I will follow the   very story mr. Trump the next question   will come from Colonel retired chaplain   run Cruz Ron is a highly decorated Army   chaplain he's been deployed several   times into combat areas in several   different locations he has personally   witnessed the attacks on religious   freedoms in the military after 28 years   of service he now heads the chaplains   alliance for military religious liberty   he worked closely with the house and the   Senate Armed Services committee's to   protect these religious liberties   chaplain Cruz mr. Trump any relation to   tetras negative and Tom Cruise negative   okay now you can take the question mr.   Trump army chaplain who is also a ranger   jolo horn had a potentially   career-ending reprimand for the crime of   using scripture while mentoring a   suicide prevention class navy chaplain   West mater who is present today was   detached for cause and threatened with   separation for using biblical answers to   questions during pastoral counseling   sessions with sailors in his command Air   Force senior master sergeant Phil monk   was relieved of duty when his lesbian   commander tried and failed to force him   to vocally voice his open support for   her personal views on marriage decorated   veteran and retired air force sergeant   oscarin Rodriguez was forcefully removed   from a friend's retirement ceremony   because he intended to use the word God   in that retirement ceremony Marine Lance   Corporal mana fosterling was convicted   a court-martial for failing to remove   scripture from her personal workspace   today commanders are prohibited from   having Bibles on their desks are using   scriptures while their counseling troops   the Obama administration has   deliberately set out to take the   Christian religion out of the military   mr. Trump how will you and your   administration combat these attacks on   military religious freedom of expression   well thank you it's a great question and   have we ever had a time like this   seriously have we ever has there any   ever been a thing like what's going on   the other day just to add to your list I   was watching one of the news programs   and they had a my dick high school   football coach you know they're going   into battle Oh is he here Oh standing up   wow they really went out of the video   for saying a prayer before that is just   I didn't know you'd be here Wow the   world is changing isn't it so you're not   allowed to pray before a football game   it would I thought it was horrible I   thought it was horrible so what did they   do to you what happened sorry to take   away from your question but it's sort of   an extension of your question what do   they do   how well I did my job and in changing 53   years always bring after every game and   it just really slapped me on it what a   horrible person that was in ended up   just not renewing my contract ultimate   acquire utta levels are so liberal   averages I think it's outrageous I think   it's very very sad and happy Rangers   okay we're just Liberty hey it's about   religious liberty and there has to be a   melding of both we're living in a time   where you have to have a melding of both   but it's very unfair what they're doing   to religion in this country and you know   one of the things that I'm doing and we   have the Johnson Amendment you know that   is Lyndon Johnson in the 1950s passed an   amendment because supposedly he was   having a hard time with a church in   houston with a pastor and he passed an   amendment saying basically if you're a   pastor if you're a religious person you   cannot get up and talk politics you   can't really his a prime example of it   you know how strongly I feel about it   and I had 50 pastors ministers I had   priest I had a couple of Rabbis in a big   conference room in one of my buildings   and we're talking and I could see they   really liked me but I could also see   they couldn't endorse me and I said just   out of curiosity why well we can't do it   because we lose our tax exempt status I   said why is that in other words you're   taking away your freedom of speech and   they started tell me about the Johnson   amendment which surely was the first   time and I started studying it and we   had a meeting a month later and I said   we're going to get rid of the Johnson   amendment because they're stopping you   and our great people from talking and   Tony and all the people i mean these are   the people we have to hear from them we   want to hear from them and you don't   mind opposing views but they're stopping   you from speaking then actually your   opposing views are able to speak because   there have to worry about tax-exempt   status some things so i think it's very   unfair and one of the things i will do   very early in my administration is to   get rid of the johnson amendment so that   our great pastors and ministers and   rabbis   and everybody and priests and everybody   can go and tell and can participate in   the process I actually looked at 50   people in the room there's strong people   powerful people by personality and I   said they're really holding your voice   back so you these powerful people some   were incredible speakers just a natural   gift for speaking and I pointed down way   down on the street on Fifth Avenue I   said so those people walking along the   street have more power than you do and I   think that's very unfair you should be   able to speak and I think that will go a   long way to addressing the problem that   you had but you have lost a lot of the   it's amazing the church and religion has   lost tremendous power and positive power   this is a negative x this is positive   power by the fact that they are   essentially prohibited from speaking   because of the tremendous problem they   have so one of the things I'm going to   do an act tremendous support with   evangelicals and with the Christians and   with everybody is we're going to get rid   of the Johnson amendment that is very   very unfair okay thank you mr. trauma in   fact in relation to the head last week   the Republican leadership introduced a   measure that would in fact repeal the   portion of the Johnson amendment that   prohibits speech by churches and   nonprofits and that was in large part   because of the visibility you've given   to that issue in fact insisting that it   be in the GOP platform the repeal of   that as well so we thank you for very   honored by that yeah they did it last   week so that's the beginning of my   process let me speak to another s on the   assumption I win if I know when you just   wasted because that's never happening   folks so you've wasted a lot of time and   energy and money well yesterday speaking   of the Johnson yesterday was the pulpit   freedom Sunday and there were thousands   of pastors across the nation myself   included that preached messages about   this election in the importance of this   election and   the IRS can be on standby my sermon is   on the way to the IRS now so that they   can evaluate it and and we'll see what   happens at that point but it's time that   churches and Christians have the freedom   to speak in this country about what is   affecting this country what is your   sermon on the way did they ask you for   it no I want to I want them to hear it I   should be good for the Gator the gospel   first off and then I political statement   secondly okay good but that is a   terrible situation is it where they   could say we don't like the way you're   speaking about Christianity about God we   don't like what you just said and we're   going to take away your tax exempt   status which you know how is a how   important it is it's very very it's a   very sad thing you have mentioned the   generals and the the Admirals and I want   to talk don't forget to sergeants all   right I know that's what I'm talking   about we want to get their advice also   believe me in fact coach Kennedy his   story which was actually broken by Todd   Starnes at Fox News is a retired Marine   Gunnery Sergeant and our final question   I do want to thank you again for being   so generous with your time and having   this conversation with these military   warriors I want to go back to something   you spoke about earlier in relationship   to the VA but also about the the   well-being of our warriors you know a   nation is judged by how it takes care of   its warriors those who have defended our   ideals and our principles and have been   willing to put themselves in harm's way   and this is not unconnected at the   conversation we were just having because   it is that Christian ethic that even   Jesus talked about greater love hath no   man than to lay down his life for his   friends I mean in this room have been   willing to do so but they have seen   their friends make the ultimate   sacrifice and that is that is a burden   that they carry and it is a difficulty   that they face and we should not require   them to face that alone as a nation and   so our final question comes from staff   sergeant Chad roba shoe so I wrote a   shoe is a former Special Operations   force recon marine that is the the   toughest of the tough and the you   smc he was the point eight times the   combat he suffered and has fully   recovered from depression and PTSD he   has been there done that he now heads   the mighty oaks warriors or your program   that serves active-duty veterans and   their families in the most this in the   most statistically successful such   program of its kind in the country Staff   Sergeant roba sure morning mr. Trump as   you mentioned there's a tragic suicide   epidemic local veterans military and   their families while the military VA   working on the problem the efforts   continue to fall short there are a   number of faith-based programs outside   the DoD and the VA that are continuing   to be successful in stopping suicide and   divorce rates spiritual fitness works on   these types of problems the government   is not taking advantage of these   programs and services so my question for   you is when you become president will   you support and fund a moral more   holistic approach to solve the problems   in issues of veteran suicide PTSD TBI   and other related military mental and   behavioral health issues and we take   steps to restore their historic role of   our chaplains and the importance of   spiritual fitness and spiritual   resiliency programs yes I would look we   need that so badly and when you would   you talk about the mental health   problems when people come back from war   in combat and they see things that maybe   a lot of the folks in this room have   seen many times over and you're strong   and you can handle it but a lot of   people can't handle it and they see   horror stories they see events that you   couldn't see in a movie nobody would   believe it now we need a mental health   help and medical and it's one of the   things that I think is least addressed   and it's one of the things that I hear   like your question is one of the things   that I hear the most about when I go   around and talk to the veterans so we're   gonna have a very very robust very very   robust level of performance   having to do with mental health we are   losing so many great people that can be   taken care of that proper care you know   when you hear the 22 suicides a day it's   big part of your question but when you   hear the 22 suits suicides a day that   should never be that should never be so   we're going to be addressing that very   strongly and the whole mental health   issue is going to be a very important   issue when I take over and the VA is   going to be fixed in so many ways but   that's going to be one of the ways we're   going to help and that's in many   respects going to be the number one   thing we have to do because I think it's   really been left behind okay thank you   very much to say one thing Tony we were   talking last night and one of the things   that we are excited about is that you're   beholden to nobody except maybe   Kellyanne yeah but you're going to have   to choose leaders you're beholden to no   one we'd like to say a secretary of   defense that is there because he or she   has the capabilities and the qualities   that are required to move our military   back to where it needs to be you're   beholden to no one we could give you   several recommendations if you're   interested but but I actually like that   I think I mean who else should I be   listening to you but the people in this   room military leaders obviously we   believe that some of your key   appointments will be the military   leadership sabay a man and uniform I   agree a hundred percent you again mr.   Trump thank you for the generosity of   your time but I want to close our time   together asking you to speak directly to   these warriors because your look in   their faces you can see some the scars   that came with their service to our   country you can see the years that they   have devoted to the principles and   ideals that made America great but   they're here reporting for duty again   they realize that a lot is on the line   for our country and so as you sit here   before them this morning before you   depart what would be your final words to   them as they go back to their respective   parts of the country well Tony thank you   very much and I will say this just as   the general said I'm beholding to nobody   I've spent you know tens and tens of   millions of dollars on the campaign I'm   going to be spending a lot more over the   next month in addition we've raised a   lot of money from small people that   people that give small donations people   that want to be a part of it and they've   been very much left behind we call them   the forgotten man and woman and we   raised millions and more than any   Republican ever thought possible you   know you heard 28 million one month and   41 million and that these are in small   61 dollar average donations   approximately and we're very proud of   that but the truth is I am beholden to   know when nobody is going to tell me   what to do no group that owns a military   firm that gives military supplies   because I know I've heard the case where   oftentimes you want to buy certain   weapons or something and you like one   but you get the other one because that   one has a contact to our politicians   those days are over those days are over   you're going to get   because you're going to get the best   equipment you're gonna get what's good   you're going to get what the generals   and what the Admirals and what end the   enlisted and they'll we'll get together   we want to get the right stuff but the   truth is that the people in this room   and your representatives all over this   country the military people are so   important to our country without you we   wouldn't be here I don't think you've   been given the respect that you deserve   I don't think you've been allowed to   fight Isis as an example the way you   want it I don't think you've been   allowed to fight in Iraq the way you've   wanted if they listen to the military   people we probably wouldn't be having an   Isis right now I think I can say not   probably I think we definitely wouldn't   be having an Isis right now but we're   running a war by politicians and we're   running a war by political correctness   as per that question I can only tell you   this and I speak about it all the time   we have a navy that hasn't been in this   position since World War one we have an   army that hasn't been in this position   since World War 2 in terms of levels and   in terms of readiness and in terms of   everything else we are not capable like   we have to be this will be one of my   most important elements when I talk   cost-cutting I do for so many different   departments where the money is pouring   and they don't even know what to do with   it but when it comes to the military we   have to enhance our military it's   depleted that's the word i tend to use   it's a depleted we have a very depleted   military with great people we have a   depleted military i told you about the   jet fighter as well it's like that with   so many other things so we're going to   take care of our military we're going to   take care of our military the people in   our military the finest people we have   we are going to take care of our law   enforcement because in some ways that's   going hand in hand now more and more   when you see what's going on and the   people that were allowing into our   country we are allowing people into our   country that are going to cause us   tremendous problem this isn't a question   of will it happen this is a question of   when where people coming into our   country who are going to cause you and   our law enforcement tremendous crumbs   and have therefore our society in the   future because we have politicians that   should be ashamed of themselves so I can   only say this a very very important   element of any country but our country   and in my you know my opinion the single   most important thing that a president   can do is the defense of our country I   mean we can talk all of the elements we   can talk about Medicare and Medicaid and   Social Security we can talk about school   we can talk about everything defense is   number 10 we don't have a country our   military our military our military and   the strength of our military and the   strengthening of our military is a   number one priority for the trumpet   administration and the world's going to   respect us again and they don't know a   lot of that has to do with the leader   and a lot of it has to do with   leadership but our country is going to   be respected again and we are going to   make America great again thank you all   very much   ah   [Music]   you   [Music]

doing this lots   of time lots of energy spending my money   but I'm fighting for you   [Applause]   Hillary Clinton is a throwback from   yesterday our campaign is about creating   a new American

America's Republicans   Democrats independents liberals   conservatives who turn on television   every night and don't see anyone   speaking up for them the forgotten man   the forgotten woman this campaign is   about giving a voice to those who don't   have one I am your voice I am your voice   I understand the great responsibility   you have and especially the   responsibility you've placed in me and I   will never ever let you down   once again it will be a government of By   and For the People let's talk about what   my reform agenda will mean for the   citizens of virginia and i have to say i   love this state i have businesses in   this state that great businesses and   we're going to take care of this state   and we're going to take care of this   country but first let's talk about our   amazing veterans veterans   the Commonwealth of Virginia is home to   about 800,000 veterans who have served   bravely our country to all veterans here   tonight and across this nation thank you   very much thank you thank you we will   never let you down we will never let you   down government is letting you down very   badly right now we are never ever going   to let our great veterans down the Obama   Clinton administration has betrayed our   veterans and it's betrayed them very   badly veterans are dying waiting for   simple care they're dying online waiting   to see a doctor five days six days seven   days in all ends and it ends fast under   a trump administration   I have a detailed ten-point plan on   Veterans reform available on my website   which everybody is talking about and the   veterans love check it out at the center   of the plan is veterans Choice the VA   will remain a public system because it   is really a public trust but veterans   will have the right to either she care   at the VA facility and if they can't get   it and get it quickly they have the   right to go to a private doctor or   medical clinic across the street and   we'll take care of them   [Applause]   never again will we allow a veteran to   die waiting for the care that they need   and they should be getting more than   anybody a top administration will also   rebuild our sadly depleted military   sadly the play doh the best way to keep   our troops out of harm's way and to keep   our nation out of preventable conflicts   is to remember those famous words very   very famous words peace through strength   [Applause]   unfortunately our active-duty armed   forces have shrunk from 2 million in   1991 to 1.3 million today a big big   reduction the Navy has shrunk from over   500 ships to 270 Q ships during the same   period of time think of that so sad the   Air Force is about one-third smaller   than it was in 1991 President Obama   has proposed a 2017 defense budget that   in real dollars touch nearly twenty-five   percent from what we were spending in   2011 we faced threats as never ever   before but the Obama Clinton   administration is determined to keep   shrinking our military until you know   what ultimately is going to happen and   it's not going to be good that I can   tell you president Obama has said that   he thinks the greatest threat we face is   global warming   remember President Obama and Hillary   Clinton sometimes referred to as crooked   Hillary can't even say the words radical   Islamic terrorism can't even say they   don't want to get involved everybody   knows what's happening they can't say   the words now while President Obama and   Hillary Clinton are shrinking America's   military they're also expanding think of   it expanding through allowing it to   happen the military of Iran   they're doing this with their disastrous   deal that puts Iran on the path to   nuclear weapons and gives them another   150 billion dollars not to mention the   four hundred million dollars in cash   which turned out to be a ransom payment   after all just like I said in other   words our president lied to us he lied   to us let's also not forget that Hillary   Clinton's disasters Middle East policies   Unleashed Isis onto the world a fact for   which Hillary Clinton has expressed zero   remorse and no apologies   she will never be able to fix the ISIS   problem that her policies created for   one thing she doesn't have the strength   or the stamina coupled with all of the   other problems that this country has and   we have a lot yet as our military was   depleted on Hillary Clinton's watch   things turned out really well for her   and only her the Clintons made 60   million dollars in gross income while   she was Secretary of State   Plus countless more to the phony Clinton   Foundation it's called pay-for-play   she even created an illegal private   email server one easily hacked by our   foreign enemies to hide her corrupt   dealings then   [Applause]   then she deleted 33,000 emails to try   and cover her tracks these were the   emails for the wedding and for yoga   classes thirty-three thousand emails   would we like to see what was on those   emails she lied about it all even to   Congress a trumpet administration will   end the government corruption once and   for all   no one will be above the law let's talk   about another major issue right here in   Virginia it's called energy energy i   visited the hard-working coal miners in   the state and they are hardworking and   they love being coal miners and that's   what they want to do their tremendous   hard-working people who only want to be   able to do their jobs provide for their   families and give power to this country   we are going to put our great miners and   steel workers back to work   but Hillary Clinton wants to put them   out of a job   you know her statement made not so long   ago wants him out of a job let's repeat   her infamous words because this is   exactly what she said put a lot of coal   miners and coal companies that employ a   lot of people folks a lot of people and   a lot of people right here in Virginia   put them out of business out of business   that's what she wants it   so sad according to the energy   information administration the United   States has the largest recoverable coal   resources in the world we're talking   clean coal beautiful clean call these   reserves are located in Virginia West   Virginia Kentucky Pennsylvania and   Illinois to name a few examples over   ninety percent of us call is used for   electricity in other words my plan will   make your energy bill much less   expensive much much cheaper Hillary   Clinton's auntie energy agenda is a   massive tax on the poor it's also a   massive tax on the people of Virginia   and the people of our country in January   2016 the Obama administration announced   a moratorium on new coal leases on   federal lands this comes on the heel of   many other anti-coal regulations from   the Obama administration Virginia the   largest exporter of coal in the United   States will be crushed by these Obama   Clinton policies Christ is going to have   a huge negative impact on Virginia   thanks to Obama Clinton agenda call   experts from the port of Virginia the   largest port for coal expectation you   know that the largest they export more   than any other place tremendous number   of jobs largest in the country have   declined significantly in fact at record   numbers over the last three years soon   you won't have any jobs Virginia has   seen a stunning seventy percent decline   in coal jobs since 1990 Hillary Clinton   will finish the mining industry off   for good there will no longer be an   English and we're not going to let that   happen knocking 11 according to the   heritage foundation by 2030 the   obama-clinton energy restrictions will   eliminate another half a million   manufacturing jobs reduce economic   output to 2.5 trillion dollars and   reduce incomes by seven thousand dollars   per person meaning you're going to be   making a lot less money years from now   then you make right now a trump   administration will end the   obama-clinton war on the American worker   we will unleash an energy revolution the   likes of which we have never seen before   according to the Institute for energy   research lifting the restrictions on all   sources of American energy will do a lot   of things number one increase GDP by   more than 100 billion dollars annually   money we desperately need and over   500,000 new and high paying jobs   annually increase annual wages by more   than 30 billion dollars over the next   seven years think of that increased   federal state and local tax revenues by   almost six trillion dollars over four   decades increased total economic   activity by more than 20 trillion   dollars over the next longer period of   time doesn't that sound good to you   folks doesn't that sound good   [Applause]   Hillary Clinton will make America poor   you're going to lose your jobs you're   gonna lose your wages you can lose your   medical Obamacare is a catastrophe   you're going to lose everything I want   to make America wealthy again another   industry of huge importance to the state   and country is agriculture especially in   Virginia farmers are the backbone of   America we have a lot of farmers here   lata farmer a lot of jobs agriculture   and forestry combined provide over   400,000 jobs right here in the   Commonwealth and I have one of the   largest wineries on the East Coast in   Charlottesville   provide a lot of jobs at that winery and   it's doing great business but the   massive regulations and EPA   interventions from the Obama Clinton   administration have devastated America's   farmers agriculture and forestry workers   they'll all be looking for jobs you're   not going to be able between taxes and   regulations and environmental controls   many of which are not necessary it's   devastating to the farmer devastated   Hillary Clinton supports every last   job-killing Obama regulation and wants   to go much much further the farms will   be closed she wants to put the farmers   out of business just like she wants to   put the miners and steel workers out of   business and we're not going to let it   happen we're doing the opposite in fact   Hillary Clinton's 1.3 trillion dollar   tax hike would raise taxes on family   farms to as much as nearly fifty percent   more than they're paying now fifty   percent   she even wants to tax them again at   death by as much as forty five percent   the death tax and the death tax is a   very very big weapon and war on farmers   a trump administration will be pro   agriculture one hundred percent I just   announced the new members of my   agriculture advisory committee and they   include Virginia's very own congressman   Bob Goodlatte where's Bob he's around   here someplace together we're going to   work on reforms to support our family   farms and boost agricultural production   in America to record levels will be   exporting our product we will be so   proud of what we're doing again   [Applause]   that begins with hiring a pro farmer   pro-american energy head at a very very   destructive EPA   it also means i am going to eliminate   the destructive and invasive waters of   the United States rule that was   unilaterally issued by this   administration and that is a job killer   like never before this rule is so   extreme it gives federal agencies   control over creeks and small streams   even puddles on your private property   you can't do business anymore I'm also   going to cut taxes for family farms down   to fifteen percent from thirty five   percent on top of that we are going to   end that death tax on family farms which   has truly really and I mean really hurt   this great American industry and frankly   family farms manufacturing you can look   at any industry we want American   business tax will be cut from thirty   five percent to fifteen percent and new   jobs are going to flow into our country   again   then by unleashing American energy   including clean calls we are going to   make it easier and cheaper and less   expensive to produce saving money we are   going to produce like never before   saving money for consumers all the way   up and down the line this will give   America the competitive edge it   desperately needs we are losing so badly   to other countries our jobs are gone   everything's gone everything's gone it's   going to change and it's going to change   fast finally on the subject when we   negotiate trade deals we will make sure   that they are going to be fair and   balanced no more one-sided trade deals   where we open our markets but they close   their markets   not anymore no more trade deals where we   can't get our product into their country   but they can dump all the product they   want in two hours no more another issue   I'd like to address briefly today is   very important to everyone to this state   it's called law and order   I was honored to meet today with   Stafford County sheriff's deputy Brandon   Boyle who sustained five gunshot wounds   to summer in the line of duty and by the   way let's give a great big hand to our   police and law enforcement   I want to thank all of those in our   police departments all over the country   in law enforcement generally for the   unbelievable job they do thank you we   thank you and I mean this from the   bottom of my heart everybody else says   we thank you and we are standing with   you and I am very proud I have to say to   have the support of almost that i know   of almost the entire law enforcement   community so important so we're talking   about a lot of different transactions   going on Hillary Clinton is banking on   her friend Terry McAuliffe on getting   thousands   a violent felons to the voting booth in   an effort to cancel out the votes of   both law enforcement and crime victims   they are letting people vote in your   Virginia election that should not be   allowed to vote   that is sad so sad at the same time   Hillary Clinton wants to essentially   abolish the Second Amendment for   law-abiding Americans   she wants to overturn the Supreme Court   ruling that affirmed the Second   Amendment as a private right so that any   city or state in this country can ban   private gun ownership   the NRA endorsed me they gave me the   earliest endorsement they've ever given   we will save the Second Amendment and   appoint judges who will protect your   freedom   [Applause]   we will appoint great great justices for   the Supreme Court of the United States   one more issue central to lon order is   having a secure immigration system   failed governor and he was a failed   governor Tim Kaine   whose watch during remember this during   his watch Virginia's unemployment rate   more than doubled and his first his   first move as the governor of the state   was to raise taxes by four billion   dollars first week   he also oversaw a huge increase in   illegal immigration a tremendous ingles   and remember what I said tim kaine   proposed nearly a four billion dollar   tax increase and that's what they're   going to be doing to you again it's a   tax increase on purple it's what's gonna   happen she's already said it massive tax   increases for everybody and you had a   governor who did it in his first week a   governor who wasn't even popular with   the people of Virginia tax increases   bringing in lots of immigration and he   didn't even know what he was bringing in   so people earning as little as seventeen   thousand a year had to pay more tax over   all the illegal immigrant population in   Virginia has nearly tripled since 2000   putting enormous pressure on schools at   public services nearly tripled it's   getting worse now we're gonna build a   wall don't worry we're gonna build along   you feel the world   we're going to build the wall   [Applause]   [Applause]   we're going to build the wall and Mexico   is going to pay for the wall believe me   100   believe me and that will be very easy   that will be very very easy politicians   think we're joking we don't joke we   don't jump this is a movement this is a   movement and movements don't joke   believe me it's getting worse now as   thousands of recent border crossers are   being relocated to the state of Virginia   and you don't know who they are you   don't know where they come from even   your government officials know nothing   about them for the most part you have no   idea what's going on and our president   and Hillary Clinton they don't have a   clue we have got to be so smart so tough   and so vigilant or we're not going to   have a country anymore folks the people   hurt most by our open border are low   income hispanic and african americans   who are competing for jobs and community   resources against new arrivals our open   border is also being used as they   recruiting tool for criminal gangs   creating a growing gang problem right   here in the state of virginia where   large numbers of gang members are in our   country illegally right here in the   state of virginia   we are going to end this chaos and   restore peace law and order to our land   finally today I'd like to address an   issue of great and very deep personal   importance to me in recent days across   this country I've asked the African   American community to honor me with   their vote   I fully recognize the outreach to the   african-american community is in an area   where the Republican Party must do   better and it will be better the GOP is   the party of Abraham Lincoln and I want   our party to be the home of the African   American voter once again I want a   totally inclusive country and I want an   inclusive party we reject the bigotry of   Hillary Clinton who sees people of color   only as votes not as human beings worthy   of a better future we've seen what the   Democratic policies have done in cities   like Detroit Baltimore Chicago and many   many more virtually all of your inner   cities are totally run and controlled by   Democrats and they have been for many   many years now Hillary Clinton wants to   make things worse by raising taxes on   2.6 million african-american owned   businesses in this country   my goal is to provide every   african-american child in our country   with access to the ladder of American   success that means good education and a   great paying job   it includes also   [Applause]   Thank You education and jobs it includes   also School Choice competition school   choice it means reforming regulations so   young Americans can get the credit they   need to start a small business and that   includes african-americans Hispanics and   everybody else in our country that's   what we need it means trade and   immigration policies that put American   workers at the front of the line way   ahead of the workers of other countries   who are beating us so badly they're   beating us so badly Hillary Clinton's   amnesty plan will give jobs benefits and   Social Security to millions of people   here illegally at taxpayer expense and   many of these people   and many of these people are treated   better than our vets are treated that is   not going to happen   on top of that according to the US   Senate immigration subcommittee her plan   would bring six hundred and twenty   thousand refugees in her first term   alone   [Applause]   from Syria not going to know who they   are and where they came from could be   the great Trojan horse of all time get   ready get ready she would rather provide   a job to a refugee living overseas than   a young unemployed african-american   youth in Virginia a trump administration   will put American workers first   [Applause]   americanism not globalism will be our   credo   [Applause]   we will bring America together as one   country again united as Americans in   common purpose and common dreams we will   have a thriving economy a strong border   a powerful military a peaceful nation a   rising standard of living this is what I   promise you let's get out there and win   or November a   [Applause]   we are going to win in the state of   Virginia if we win in the state of   Virginia we are going to the White House   and we are going to take care of our   people we are going for victory we must   win our november eighth together we will   make America wealthy again we will make   America proud again we will make America   safe again and we will make America   great again for

fAkumy7_Pbc~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20170111~WATCH FULL: President-Elect Donald Trump Holds Press Conference at Trump Tower (1/11/2017)~1013054.0~3.37449836731~5177.0~3544.0~   all right outside Oval Office have real   collection and I'm told here is the   elevator has opened the rug out from   theirs   warning sacred   gateway from the inauguration of the   next president and vice president the   United States it's an opportunity to be   here today to allow the president-elect   to take your questions after the   president-elect make some remarks he   will introduce mishary Dylan a prominent   attorney in Washington DC with the   prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who was   who structure the agreement pursuant to   the president's business arrangement and   she will give brief remarks before we   start I want to bring your attention to   a few points on the report that was   published in BuzzFeed last night it's   frankly outrageous and highly   irresponsible for a left-wing bloc that   was openly hostile with President Lex   campaign to drop highly salacious and   flat-out false information on the   internet just days before he takes the   oath of office according to BuzzFeed's   own editor there are some serious   reasons to doubt the allegations in the   report the executive editor of the New   York Times also dismissed the report by   saying it was poked totally   unsubstantiated echoing the concerns   that many other reporters expressed on   the internet the fact that BuzzFeed and   CNN made the decision to run with his   unsubstantiated claim is a sad and   pathetic attempt to get clicks the   report is not an intelligence report   plain and simple one is you that the   report talked about was the relationship   with three individuals associated with   the campaign these three individuals   Paul Manafort Michael Cohen and Carter   page harder page is an individual that   the president-elect does not know and   was put on notice months ago by the   hey Paul Manafort has adamantly denied   any of this involvement and Michael   Cohen who is said in visited Prague in   August in September did not leave or   enter the United States during this time   we asked him to produce his passport to   confirm his whereabouts of the dates in   question and there was no damn doubt   that he was not in Prague in fact mr.   Cohen has never been in Prague a new   report actually suggests that Michael   Cohen was epogen at the University of   Southern California with his son at a   baseball game one report now suggested   apparently it's another Michael condom   for all the talk lately about fake news   this political witch hunt by some of the   media is based on some of those flimsy   reporting and it's frankly shameful and   disgraceful with that is my honor to   introduce the next vice president of the   United States my pets we are nine days   away from the inauguration of the 45th   president of the United States of   America I'm profoundly honored and   humbled that I will take the oath of   office to serve as vice president of the   United States nine days from today but   I'm even more honor satana shoulder to   shoulder with a new president who will   make America great again   the president elects leadership and his   energy during the campaign was   impressive but as the chairman of the   transition effort I can assure the   American people that his energy and his   vision during the course of this   transition has been even more inspired   to see the way he has brought together   men and women of extraordinary   capability at a historic pace in this   cabinet 19 of the 21 cabinet officials   have been announced nine committee   hearings already scheduled seven more   soon to go on the books in the next   several days and it is it is a   compilation of men and women with an   unprecedented caliber of leadership and   background to help this administration   move our nation forward perhaps that's   why there's been such a concerted effort   by some in the mainstream media to D   legitimize this election and to demean   our incoming administration you know I   have long been a supporter of a free and   independent press and I always will be   but with freedom comes responsibility   and the irresponsible decision of a few   news organizations to run with a false   and unsubstantiated report when most   news organizations resisted the   temptation to propagate this fake news   can only be attributed to media bias and   attempted to mean the president   and our incoming administration and the   American people are sick and tired of it   today we'll get back to real news to   real facts and the real progress our   incoming president has already made in   reviving the American economy and   assembling a team that will make America   great again and we'll hear from the   president-elect about issues that are of   paramount importance to the American   people's edition so it is my honor to   introduce to all of you my friend and   the president-elect of the United States   of America Donald Trump   because to give them on a almost daily   basis I think you probably may be won   the nomination because of news   conferences and it's good to be with you   he stopped giving them because we're   getting quite a bit of inaccurate news   but I do have to say that and I must say   i want to thank a lot of the news   organizations here today because they   looked at that nonsense that was   released by maybe the intelligence   agencies who knows maybe the   intelligence agency   plot on that record if they infected   that a tremendous block because the   thing like that should have never been   written that you've never been had it   should simply never have been released   but I want to thank a lot of the news   organizations for some of whom have not   treated me very well Avengers a couple   in particular and they came out so   strongly against that fake news and the   fact that was really about by primarily   one group and one television station so   I just want to complement any other   people in the room a great respect that   it is a great respect for treatment   press and all of that but I will tell   you there were some news organizations   what was just said that were so   professional so incredibly professional   that I've just got up a notch as   demanding okay all right we've had some   great news over the last couple of weeks   I've been quite active I guess   economic way in the country a lot of car   companies are going to be moving in we   have other companies big news is going   to be announced over the next couple of   weeks companies that I've been building   in the midwestern so yesterday   fiat-chrysler big baby factory going to   be built in this country as opposed to   another country before just announced   that they stopped plans for a big dollar   plant in Mexico and they're going to be   moving into Michigan expanding very   substantially an existing plant I   appreciate that from Ford I appreciate   it very much from fiat-chrysler I hope   that General Motors will be following   and I think they will mean I think a lot   of people will be following I think a   lot of industries are going to be coming   back we have to get our truck industry   coming back by drug industry has been   disastrous they're leaving left and   right they supply our drugs but they   don't make them here to a large extent   and the other thing we have to do is   create new bidding procedures with a   drug industry because they get away with   murder in pharma formatted a lot of   lobbies a lot of lobbyists a lot out and   there's very little bidding on drugs   with the largest buyer of drugs in the   world and yet we don't fit properly and   we start getting into safe millions of   dollars over a period of time I'm going   to do that with a lot of other   industries I'm very much involved with   the generals and admirals on the   airplane the f-35 you've been   and it's way way behind schedule with   many many billions of dollars over   budget I don't like that and the   Admirals have been fantastic the   generals have been fantastic I've really   gotten it home well and we're going to   do some big things on the f-35 program   and perhaps the f-18 program and we're   going to get those costs way down and   we're going to get the plane to be even   better and we have some competition it's   going to be a beautiful thing so we've   been very very much involved at other   that we had jet law we had so many   incredible people were coming here to   our know they can do tremendous things   tremendous things in this country and   they're very excited and I will say if   the election didn't turn out the way it   turned out that would not be here that   would not be in my office and without   being anybody else's office they be   building and doing things of other   countries so there's a great spirit   going on right now a spirit that many   people have told me they've never seen   before ever we're going to create jobs i   said that i won't be the greatest jobs   producer late that's God ever created   and I mean   we work very hard we need circle and   some other things you're putting a   little bit of luck but I think we're   going to do a review and over throughout   of what we've done and we   got there yet I look very much forward   to the deliberation it's going to be a   beautiful event we have great Ally   tremendous talent and we have the all   the bands or most of the minions from   the different for the different segments   of the military and I've heard some of   these bands over the years there in   present we have a very very elegant day   the 20th is going to be something that   will be very very special very beautiful   and i think i'm going to have pass   across because we have a movement it's a   movement like the world has never seen   before it's a movement that a lot of   people didn't expect and even the poles   although some indicators writing to her   but many of them didn't it was a   beautiful cedar november eight as those   states started before and he's fantastic   focused very hard on those things and   they're really reciprocated and those   states have a lot of jobs and you can   have a lot of security they're going to   have a lot of good news for their   veterans and by the way speaking of   veterans I   today the head secretary of the Veterans   Administration David Shelton and we'll   do a news release of the while tell you   about David he's fantastic he's   fantastic you will do a truly which one   of the commitments I made this witness   right now the whole situation for   veterans or veterans have been treated   all the way there waited in line for   fifteen sixteen seventeen days cases   where they go ahead and they have a   minor early stage form of cancer and   they can't skin doctor by the time they   get to the doctor their terminal on the   top of them I got a half the absolute   rock a nap top of the line and they're   going to get together they're great   doctors dr. Toby Cosgrove is you know   for the Cleveland Clinic is we're very   involved I pro boner has been very very   involve are the great men of business   and we're going to straighten out the VA   for our veterans have been promising   that for a long time and something of   your very version of yourself you'll get   the information on David and I think   you'll be very impressed with the job   because and we looked long and hard we   interviewed at least a hundred people   some boots and not so   we had a lot of talent and you think   this election will be something that   will with time with time straighten it   out and straight ahead for good because   our veterans have been treated very   unfairly okay yes mr. president I thank   you so much thank you did a couple of   aspects of the intelligence briefing   that you received on Friday that we're   looking for further clarification on   sugar first of all did the heads of the   intelligence agencies provide you with a   two-page summary of these   unsubstantiated allegations and secondly   to that on the broader picture do you   accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin   ordered the hack of the DNC the   attention back to the RNC and if you do   how will that color your attempts to   build a relationship with a leader who   has been accused of committing an act of   espionage okay that's it these meetings   as you know are confidential classified   so now I have to talk about court one on   the meeting and we have many witnesses   in that meeting many of them with us and   I will say again I think it's a disgrace   that information would be let out I saw   the information I read the information   outside of that being it's all fake news   it's phony stuff it didn't happen and it   was gotten by opponents of ours as you   know because you reported it in so many   people it was a group of abundance who   got together sick people and they put   that breath together so i will tell you   that not within the meeting but outside   of the meeting somebody released it it   should never been promotion of even   entered paper but it should never been   released I read what mode is released   and I think it's a disgrace I think it's   an absolute disgrace as far as hacking i   think was rushing but i think we also   could have quite other countries and   other people and i can say that you know   when when we lost 22 million names and   everything else that was hacked recently   they didn't they give me a lot of that   was something that was extraordinary   that was probably china we had we have   much hacking good one of the things   we're going to do we are some of the   greatest computer minds anywhere of the   world that we've assembled you saw just   a sec 11 2 weeks ago up here where can   the six top people in the world that   would ever had sent move together as a   group and whatever those minds together   and we're going to form a difference I   have to say there's also the Democratic   National Committee was totally hoping to   be hacked they did a very poor job they   could have had active defense which we   and that was given price previous credit   because when rights so what was   happening in the world and with this   gunman he went out and went to various   firms and what are they very very slow I   can   offensive and they tried to have the   Republican National Committee that they   were running with a breakthrough we have   to do that for a country it's very   congested just to the life story just be   the last part of that question why I   said how could all of this potentially   color your attempts to build a better   relationship with President Putin well   you know President Putin and Russia put   out a statement today that this fake   news was indeed fake news they said it   totally never happened now somebody   would say oh of course he's going to say   that I respected the fact that he said   that and I I'll be honest I think if he   did have something they would have   released it they would have been glad to   release it I think frankly had they   broken into the Republican National   Committee I think they would have   released it just like they did about   Hillary and all of the horrible things   that her people like mr. Podesta said   about her I mean what he said about her   was horrible if somebody said about me   what Podesta said about Hillary I was   the boss I would have fired him   immediately or that person because what   he said about her was horrible but   remember this we talked about the   hacking Hawkins band and it should he be   done but look at the things that were   hacked look at what was learned from   that hacking that Hillary Clinton got   the questions to the debate and didn't   report it that's a horrible thing that's   a horrible thing can you imagine that if   Donald Trump got the question to the   debate it would have been the biggest   story in the history of stories and they   would have said immediately you have to   get out of the race nobody even talked   about it it's very terrible thing yes   personalize your sister Thank You mr.   president-elect I on that intelligence   report that the second part of their   conclusion was that Vladimir Putin   ordered it because he aspired to help   you in the election do you accept that   part of the finding and will you undo   what President Obama did to punish the   Russians for this really came it in   place if likes Donald Trump I consider   that an asset not a liability because we   have a horrible relationship with Russia   Russia can help us fight Isis which by   the way is number one tricky I mean if   you look this administration created   Isis by leaving at the wrong time   the void was created Isis was formed if   Putin likes Donald Trump guess what   folks that's called an asset not a   liability now I don't know that I'm   going to get along with Vladimir Putin I   hope I do but there's a good chance I   won't and if I don't do you honestly   believe that Hillary would be tougher on   Putin than me does anybody that this   will really believe that give me a break   the president promised a freaking clear   weather during your visits to either   Moscow or suit Petersburg you engaged in   conductor you now regret and that a   reasonable when are we suppose ever   saying that you are potentially   vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or   bites intelligence agents would you say   what i do when i leave our country i'm a   very high-profile person would you say i   am extremely careful i'm surrounded by   bodyguards i'm surrounded by people and   i always tell them anywhere but i always   tell them if i'm leaving this country be   very careful because in your hotel rooms   and no matter where you go you there   probably have cameras i'm not referring   just to russia but i would certainly put   them in that category and number one I   hope you're going to be good anyway but   in those rooms you have cameras in the   strangest places cameras that are so   small with modern technology you can't   see them and you won't know you better   be careful or you'll be watching   yourself or nightly television I tell   this to people all the time I was in   Russia years ago with Miss Universe   contest which did very well Moscow the   Moscow area did very very well and I   told many people be careful because you   don't want to see yourself in television   cameras all over the place and again not   just like all over does anyone really   believe that story i'm also very much of   a germaphobe but   your business but first I have to follow   up on some of these Russia remarks based   on your comments here today do you   believe the hacking which justified does   Russia have any leverage over you   financial or otherwise and if not will   you release your favorite returns to   privileged so I do it that I have no   dealings with Russia I have no deals in   Russia I have no deals that could happen   in Russia because we've stayed away and   I have no loans with Russia as a real   estate developer I have very very little   debt I have assets that are and how   people have found out how big the   company in cipher loop that are very low   did but I have no loans with Russia at   all and I thought that was important but   I certified that so I have no deals I   have hell loans I have no guilt we could   make deals in Russia very easily we   wanted to I just don't want to because I   think that would be a conflict so I have   no love no dealings and no current   anything feels now I have to say one of   them over the weekend i was offered two   million dollars to do a deal in Dubai   with a very very very amazing man great   great development from the Middle East   who say Damac a friend of them quickly   and was offered two billion dollars to   do a deal in Dubai nope refused and I   turned it down I didn't have to turn it   because as you know i have a no conflict   situation because over us   which is I didn't know about that until   about three months ago but it's a nice   thing to have but I don't want to take   advantage of something I have something   that others don't have vice president   pencil so has it I don't think he'll   need to have a feeling he's not going to   need but I haven't no conflict of   interest provision as president it was   many many years old with 64 process   because they don't want presidents   getting I understand they know what   residents getting tangled up the   tradition they want to press left to run   the government so I could actually run   my business I could actually run my   business and run government at the same   time I don't like the way that looks but   I was able to do that if I wanted to I   be the only one that will be able to do   them you can't do that in any other   capacity but as a president I could run   the Trump Organization great great   company and I could run the company I   think I do fer good job but I want to do   now all of these haters that you see   here yesterday when I could fall before   conflicts do you believe the hacking was   justified and will you release your tax   returns to prove what you're saying   about no deals in Russia well not really   sure actually for the position over the   moment but every president since the 70s   his new buyer bought it from the IRS the   last six they released a surprise it has   discerned agenda government tax return   to be Jewish you don't think the   American public is concerned about   fiction I want do you believe in ideas   resin do you home   [Applause]   firstly you learned very little from   attacks future what you should do is go   down to federal elections and take a   look at the numbers and actually people   have learned a lot about my company and   now they realize my company is much   bigger much more powerful than they ever   thought where many many countries and a   very proud of it and what I'm going to   be doing is my two sons who are right   here Don and Eric are going to be   running the company they are going to be   running it in a very professional manner   they're not going to discuss it with me   again I don't have to do this they're   not going to discuss it with me and with   that I'm going to bring up sherry Dylan   and she's going to go these papers are   just some of the many documents that   I've signed turning over complete and   total control certain sensor we ask you   one more question on Russia though   certain good morning it's my honor and   privilege to be here today and   president-elect Trump's request he's   asked me as you've just heard to speak   about the conflicts of interests and the   steps he's taking as you know the   business empire built by president elect   Trump over the years is massive not   dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson   Rockefeller when he became vice   president but at that time no one was so   concerned president elect Trump wants   the American public to rest assured that   all of his efforts are directed to   pursuing the people's business and not   his own to that end   explain a few moments ago he directed me   and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan   Lewis &amp; Bockius to design a structure   for his business empire that would   completely isolate him from the   management of the company he further   instructed that we build in protections   that will assure the American people the   decisions he makes and the actions that   he takes this president Park for their   benefit and not to support his financial   interests as he said he's voluntarily   taking this off the conflicts of   interest laws simply do not apply to the   precedent for the vice president and   they are not required to separate   themselves from their financial assets   the primary conflicts of interest   statute someone questioned us section 18   USC 208 and it's simply inapplicable   bias terms and this is not just our   interpretation it's Congress itself who   made this clear in 1989 when is amended   section 18 USC 202 to state that except   as otherwise provided the terms office   and employee in section 208 shall not   include the president even so president   elect Trump wants there to be no doubt   to the mind the American public he is   completely isolated   fell from his business interests he   instructed us to take all steps   realistically possible to make it clear   that he is not exploiting the office of   the presidency for his personal benefit   he also stopped the guidance of   individuals who are familiar with and   have worked extensively in the fields of   government ethics and constitutional law   critical to the Morgan Lewis team is   Fred fielding standing here to our side   and with us today when many of you have   known him he has served several   presidents over the years including   serving as counsel to presidents ronald   reagan and george w bush as well as   serving on President George HW Bush's   Commission on federal ethics law reform   and he also held the position of vice   chair of the ethics Resource Center mr   Fielding has been extensively involved   with an approved business plan he's here   today to support the plan and he will   continue to provide guidance as the plan   is implemented and as Eric Don along   with others take over management of the   trump organization I'm going to detail   some of the extraordinary steps now that   the president-elect is taking first   president elect Trump investments and   business assets commonly known as the   form as the drug organization comprising   hundreds   entities which again you all go and take   a look at financial disclosure statement   the pages and pages and pages of   entities have all been or will be   conveyed to a trust prior to january   twentieth here is just some of the   paperwork that's taking care of those   actions second through the trust   agreement his relinquished leadership   and management of the organization to   his sons Don and Eric and a long time   traffic Sekulow Alan why silver together   Don Erik and Alan will have the   authority to manage the Trump   Organization and will make decisions for   the duration of the presidency without   any involvement whatsoever by president   elect Trump further at the president   elects direction the trust agreement   provides to it that to ensure the Trump   Organization continues to operate in   accordance with the highest and legal   ethics standards and ethics advisor will   be appointed to the management team the   written approval of the ethics advisor   will be required for New Deal's actions   and transactions the contention raised   ethics or conflicts of interests   concerns president-elect Trump as well   Don Erik and Alan are committed to   ensuring that the activities of the   organization are beyond reproach and   cannot be perceived to be exploitive at   the office of the presidency   president-elect rumble resigned from all   officer and other positions he holds   with the Trump Organization entities   further in addition his daughter Ivanka   have no further involvement with or   management authority whatsoever with the   Trump Organization as she and Jared who   their family to DC Ivanka will be set   focused on settling her children into   their new homes and their new schools   the president-elect has also already   disposed of all of his investments in   publicly traded or easily liquidated   investments as a result the trust will   have two types of assets first it will   hold liquid assets cash cash equivalents   and Treasuries and perhaps the   physicians and a government-approved   diversified portfolio one that is   consistent with the regulations from the   office of government   second the trust is going to hold this   pre-existing ill liquid but very   valuable business assets the ones that   everyone here is familiar with Trump   owned operated and branded golf clubs   commercial rental property resorts   hotels rights to royalties from   pre-existing licenses of Trump marks   productions and goods so things like   Trump Tower Meryl ARCA all of his other   business assets 40 of Wall Street will   all be in the trust through instructions   in the trust agreement president-elect   trust president elect Trump first   ordered that all pending deals be   terminated thus impacted more than 30   meals many of which were set to close by   the end of 2016 as you can well imagine   that caused an immediate financial loss   of millions of dollars not just for   president elect Trump but also for Donny   vodka and Eric the trust agreement as   directed by president drug imposes   severe restrictions on new deals no new   foreign deals will be made whatsoever   during the duration of president Trump's   presidency new domestic deals will be a   left but they will go through a rigorous   vetting process the president-elect will   have no role in deciding whether the   Trump Organization engages   new deal and he will only know of a deal   if he reads it in the paper or seized on   TV because any new deal could and I   emphasize the could be perceived as   causing a conflict or is exploiting the   office of the presidency new deals must   be vetted with the ethics advisory whose   role will be to analyze any potential   transactions for conflicts and ethics   issues the ethics advisor will be a   recognized expert in the field of   government experts again his role will   be to scrutinize the new deals and the   actions and they any new deal must   receive written approval to further   reinforce the wall that we are building   between president elect Trump from the   Trump Organization president elect Trump   has quarter through his trust agreement   to sharply limit his information rights   reports will only be available and   reflect profit lost on the company as a   whole there will be no separate business   by business accounting another step the   president-elect trunk was taken as he   created a new position at the truck   position of chief compliance council   whose responsibility will be to ensure   that the Trump businesses again are   operating at the highest levels of   integrity and not taking any actions   that could be perceived as exploiting   the office of the presidency he has also   directed no communications of the Trump   Organization including social media   accounts full reference for being tied   to president-elect Trump's role as   president of the United States or the   office of the presidency in some all of   these actions completely languished   relinquishment of Management no foreign   deals ethics advisor approval of deals   sharply limited information rights will   sever president-elect prompts presidency   from the Trump Organization some have   asked questions why not divest why not   just sell everything form a blind trust   and I'd like to turn to addressing some   of those questions now selling first and   foremost would not eliminate possibility   conflicts of interest in fact it would   be passivation the Trump brand is key to   the value of the Trump organizations   assets if president elect Trump sold his   brand who'd be entitled to royalties for   the use of it and this would result in   the trust retaining an interest in the   brand without the ability to assure that   it does not exploit the office of the   presidency further whatever price was   paid will be subject to criticism and   scrutiny was it too high is there paper   play with too much pain to curry favor   with a president-elect and selling his   bat fest without the rights to the brand   would greatly diminish the value of the   asset and create a fire sale president   elect Trump should not be expected to   destroy the company he built this plan   offers a suitable alternative to address   the concerns of the American people and   selling the entire trump organization   isn't even feasible some people have   suggested that the president-elect sell   the business to his adult children this   would require massive third-party debt   sourced with multiple lenders whose   motives and willingness to participate   would be questioned and undoubtedly   investigated and if the president-elect   were to finance the sale himself who   would retain the financial interests in   the assets that he owns now some people   have suggested that the Trump work the   president elect Trump could bundle the   assets and turn the trump organization   into a public company anyone who has   ever gone through this extraordinarily   cumbersome and complicated process knows   that it is a non-starter it is not   realistic and it would be inappropriate   for the   organization some people have suggested   a blind trust but you cannot have a   totally blind trust with operating   businesses president Trump can't unknown   he owns Trump Tower and the press will   make sure that any new developments at   the Trump Organization are well   publicized further it would be   impossible to find an institutional   trustee that would be competent to run   the Trump Organization the approach is   taking allows Don and Eric to preserve   this great company and a psychotic   assets and this approach is best from a   conflicts and ethics perspective it   creates a complete separation from   president elect Trump and separates him   and prevents him from participating in   the business imposes strict limits on   what the trustees can do and requires   the assent of any ethics advisor to a   new deal when it turns one last topic   today that has been of interest lately   called emoluments that's the word I   think we've all become familiar with and   perhaps had not heard before and we're   going to describe some other actions   president-elect Rauf is taking to avoid   even the appearance of a conflict   emoluments comes from the Constitution   the Constitution says officials may not   accept gifts titles of nobility or   emoluments from foreign governments with   respect to their office and that no   benefit should be derived by holding an   office   the so-called emoluments Clause has   never been interpreted however to apply   to fair value exchanges that have   absolutely nothing to do with an officer   no one would have thought when the   Constitution was written that pain your   hotel bill was an emolument instead it   would have been thought of as a value   for value exchange not a gift not a   title and not an emolument but since   president elect Trump has been elected   some people want to define emoluments to   cover routine business transactions like   paying for hotel rooms they suggest that   the Constitution prohibits the   businesses from even arm's length   transactions that the president electric   absolutely nothing to do with and isn't   even aware of these people are wrong   this is not what the Constitution says   paying for a hotel room is not a gift or   present and it has nothing to do with an   office it's not an emollient the   Constitution does not require president   elect Trump to do anything here but just   like with conflicts of interests he   wants to do more than what the   Constitution requires the president   elect Trump has decided we are   announcing today that he is going to   voluntarily donate all profits from   foreign government payments made to his   hotels to the United States Treasury   this way it is the American people who   will prop it in some I and   president-elect   Morgan Lewis have determined the   approach without mine today we'll avoid   potential conflicts of interests or   concerns regarding exploitation of the   office of the presidency without   imposing unnecessary an unreasonable   losses on the president-elect and his   family we believe this structure and   these steps will serve to accomplish the   president elects desire to be isolated   from his business interests and give the   American people confidence that his soul   business and interest is in making   America great again bringing back jobs   to this country securing our borders and   rebuilding our infrastructure the   American people would web well aware of   president-elect Trump's business empire   and financial interests when they voted   many people voted for him precisely   because of his business success   president elect Trump wants to bring the   success to all Americans   mr. Juncker mr. Trump can we ask you   miss truck the we actually ask you some   policy questions policy partial service   Trump Thank You mr. Trump radiation on   American news what is your response to   your critics that say not only you but   also your cavity is filled with   conflicts of interest and you plan to   set an example in the future to make   sure that your cabinet and everyone grab   you're going to strengthen question I   really think that when you watch what's   going on with what's happening in why I   was just watching as an example to Rex   Tillerson take it brilliant what he's   doing it when he said I watched   yesterday as you know our great senator   who was going to be a great attorney   general and he was brigand and what   people don't know is that he was a great   prosecutor and   attorney general at Alabama and he was   brilliant yes today so I really think   that   they are I think we have one of the   great cabinets ever put together and   even here we got from so many people   people to sell that you know the case of   Rex here an incredibly excellent mobile   when there was a fine you would get it   when they needed something he would be   the friend of mine is very very   substantial in the oil business health   hand big supporter he said there's   nobody introduces like Rex tortoises and   that's what we want that's what I want   to break your government I want to bring   the greatest people in the government   because when we behind them we don't   make good deals anymore said all the   time it's peaches you don't make the   deal saying when we make that heals our   trade deals are a disaster we have   hundreds of billions of dollars of   losses or a year in basis hundreds of   billions with China on trade and trade   imbalance with Japan with Mexico with   just about everybody we don't make you a   deal setting so we need people that   smart we need people that are successful   they got successful because generally   speaking a smart and that's what I put   on very proud of the cabinet I think it   very well it's very interesting how it's   going but it's I think they're doing   very very well ask a few questions on   Obamacare yeah can you be specific on   what guidance you're giving   congressional Republicans on the   timeline for repeal and replace sure   whether needs to be simultaneous or line   the Obamacare thought it was never going   to be a I also wanted to ask you though   if you have outlined a plan for what you   want the replace package to look like   would it guarantee coverage for those   who have gotten health insurance through   the current Obamacare law you can be   very very proud as that only the media   and reporters you can be very proud of   what we put forth having to do with   okay Obamacare is a complete and total   disaster they can say what they want   they can guide you any way they want to   guide you in some cases they got you   incorrectly in most cases you realize   what's happened it's imploding as we sit   some states have over a hundred percent   increase and 17 and I said this two   years ago 17 is going to be the bad year   it's going to be catastrophic frankly we   could sit back and it was a thought from   a political standpoint but it wouldn't   be fair to the people we could sit back   and wait and watch and criticize and we   could be a chuck schumer and sit back   and criticize it and people would come   they would come begging to us please we   have to do something about obamacare we   don't want to own it we know what   haunted politically they own it right   now so the easiest thing would be to let   it implode at 17 and believe me we get   pretty much whatever we want it but it   would take a long time we're going to be   submitted as soon as our secretary is   approved almost simultaneously shortly   thereafter a plan it will be repealed   and replace it will be essentially   simultaneously it will be various   segments you understand it but will most   likely be on the same day or the same   week but probably the same day could be   the same hour so we're going to do   repeal and replace very complicated   stuff and we're going to get a health   bill passed we're going to get health   care taken care of in this country you   have deductibles that are so high that   after people go broke paying their   premiums which is going through the roof   the health care can it be used   because the deductibles are so hot   Obamacare is the Democrats problem we   are going to take the problem off the   shelves for them we're doing them a   tremendous service by doing it you could   sit back and let them hang with it we   are doing the Democrats a great service   so as soon as our secretary is approved   and gets into the office will be filing   a plan and it was actually pretty   accurately reported today the New York   Times and the plan will be repealed and   replaced Obamacare we're going to have a   health care that is far less expensive   and far better where's my like Reba fast   you sure sir president monster puzzle   which one was what I was like well I was   going on thank you go ahead then CBS a   press like chop John Steinbeck and   chatter when you look at all the   meetings that you've had with carrier   Softbank and Alibaba if you conceive of   making this a program may be sitting   inside of Commerce and then my follow-up   question to that is how soon will we see   the program on capital repatriation and   corporate tax cuts well if I could save   jobs for instance i was doing individual   companies if it was at well that's all   in one company like we did a good job   with carrier and i want to thank united   technologies which owns carrier but we   save close to a thousand jobs and they   were gone and Mike Pence and his staff   really helped us a lot but those would   judge that was a tough one because they   announced a year and a half before that   they were leaving so it's always tough   when they're building a plant it's a   little tougher than before they stuck   what before they make an announcement so   I want to thank united technologies but   we've been meeting with a lot of   companies but what really is happening   is the word is now out that when you   want to move your plant to Mexico or   some other place and you want to fire   all of your workers from Michigan and   all   oh and all these places that i won for   good reason it's not going to happen   that way anymore you want to move your   plant and you think as an example you're   going to build that plant in Mexico and   you're going to make your air   conditioners or your cars or whatever   you're making and you're going to sell   them through a what will be a very very   strong border not a weak mortar like it   is that we don't even have a border it's   an open sieve but you're going to sell   through a very strong border not going   to happen you're going to pay a very   large border tax so if you want to move   to another country and if you want to   fire all of our great American workers   that got you there in the first place   you can move from Michigan to Tennessee   and to North Carolina and South Carolina   you can move from South Carolina back to   Michigan you can do anyway get a lot of   states at play a lot of competition so   it's not like oh gee I'm taking the   competition we get a lot of places you   can move and I don't care as long as   it's within the United States the   borders of the United says there will be   a major border tax of these companies   that are leaving and getting away with   murder and if our politicians had what   it takes that would have done this years   ago and you'd have millions more workers   right now in the united states that are   96 million really wanting a job and they   can't get you know that story the real   number that's the real number so that's   the way there's okay I have a question   about the Supreme Court and the border   security but I also want you to ask you   about something you said on Twitter this   morning are we living in Nazi Germany   what were you driving at their do you   have a problem with the intelligence   community and on the Supreme Court   what's your timeline you said a while   ago you down to four have you conducted   those interviews yet what's your   timeline for nominating and on the   border fence it now appears clear US   taxpayers will have to pay for it up   front what is your plan that's together   to get Mexico to pay for it I got you   have any more   on the fence it's not a fence to all you   just miss reported it we're going to   build a wall I could wait in about a   year and a half until we finish our   negotiations with Mexico which will   start immediately after we get to office   but I don't want to wait Mike Pence is   leading an effort to get final approvals   through various agencies and through   Congress for the wall to begin I don't   feel like waiting a year or a year and a   half i'm going to start building mexico   at some form and there are many   different forms will reimburse us and   they will reimburse us for the cost of   the law that will happen whether it's a   tax or whether it's a payment probably   less likely than it's a payment but it   will happen so remember this okay i   would say we are going to build a wall   and people would go crazy i would then   say who's going to pay for the wall and   people would all scream out twenty-five   thirty thousand people because nobody's   ever had crowds like Trump his head you   know that you don't like to report that   but that's okay ok now we agree is   finally agrees but I say who's going to   pay for the wall and they will scream   out Mexico now reports went out last   week Oh Mexico's not going to pay for   the wall because of a reimbursement   what's the difference I want to get the   walls started I don't want to wait a   year and a half until I make my deal   with Mexico so that we probably will   have a deal sooner than that and by the   way Mexico has been so nice sometimes I   respect the government of Mexico I   respect the people of Mexico I love the   people of Mexico many people from Mexico   working for me they're phenomenal people   the government of Mexico is terrific I   don't blame them for what's happened I   don't blame them for taking advantage of   the United States I wish our politicians   were so smart Mexico has taken advantage   of the   united states I don't blame the   representatives and various presidents   etc of Mexico what I say is we shouldn't   have allowed that to happen it's not   going to happen anymore so in order to   get the wall started Mexico will pay for   the wall but it'll be reimbursed okay   Supreme Court judgment so as you know I   have a list of 20 I've gone through   we've met with numerous candidates their   outstanding in every case they were   largely recommended and highly   recommended by Federalist Society jim   DeMint was also very much involved in   his group which is fantastic and he's a   fantastic guy so between Leo and Jim   DeMint and some senators and some   Congress people we have a great group of   people I'll be making the decision on   who we will put up for justice of the   united states supreme court a   replacement for the great great Justice   Scalia that will be probably within two   weeks of the 20th so within about two   weeks probably the second week I   consider the first day because we'll   also be doing some some pretty good   signings and I think what we'll do is   well wait till one day that will be our   really first business day as opposed to   doing it on Friday because on Friday   people are going to have a very good   time at the inauguration and then   Saturday as you know we're having a big   church service and lots of good things   are happening so our first day and   you'll all be invited to the signings   but we'll be doing some pretty good   signings on monday and tuesday and   wednesday and thursday and friday and   then also the next week and you're all   invited but on the supreme court i'll be   making that decision and it will be a   decision which I very strongly believe   in I think it's one of the reasons i got   elected I think   people of this country did not want to   see what was happening with the Supreme   Court so I think it was a very very big   decision as to why I was at my wife it's   sweet that you had this morning about   are we living in Nazi Germany what were   you driving out there what are you   trying to tell them i think it was a   disgraceful disgraceful that the   intelligence agencies allowed any   information that turned out to be so   false and fake out I think it's a   disgrace and I say that and I say that   and that's something that Nazi Germany   would have done and did do I think it's   a disgrace that information that was   false and fake and never happened got   released to the public as far as   BuzzFeed which is a failing pile of   garbage writing it I think they're going   to suffer the consequences they already   are and as far as CNN going out of their   way to build it up and by the way we   just found out I was coming down Michael   Cohn I was being come Michael Cohn is a   very talented lawyers a good learning my   friend was just reported that it wasn't   this Michael count they were talking   about so all night long it's Michael   come I said I want to see your passport   he brings his passport to my office I   say he went around he didn't believe the   country he wasn't out of the country   that Marco comon of the Trump   Organization was it brought it turned   out to be a different Michael come is it   disgraced what took place it's a   disgrace and I think they were to   apologize to start with Michael come sir   since you're attacking us can you give   us a question since you're no mr.   personal life go ahead since you are   attacking our news organization not can   you give us a chance can you say you are   attacking our news organization you can   you give us a chance to ask a question   sir Sir can you stay quiet mr. president   let go ahead you say categorically   question the president like can you give   us a question you're attacking us can   you give us a question be can you give   us a question I'm you I'm gonna give you   can you stick can you stay quatre you   are fake dude circa can you stay   categorically that nobody know mr.   president-elect that's not my head   breathe   Obama went too far with the sanctions he   put on Russia after the hacking do you   think they don't change what you for one   will you roll them back now what do you   think of Lindsay green I don't say we   have to send you a bill for tougher ones   cleanses have a bubble water topper   thing I think I hadn't heard Lindsey   Graham risky not do that Lindsey Graham   I've been competing with him for a long   time he's going to crack that one   percent barrier one day I didn't realize   Lindsey Graham still at it sorry I think   Lizzie Grimm's a nice guy after that he   says go ahead you've been waiting good   as far as we understand the intelligence   community stand out yet in panel from   BBC News he'll handled from BBC News   Venus you to another video thank you   thank you as far as we understand in the   intelligence community are still looking   at these allegations is false news as   you describe it if they come back with   any kind of conclusion but any of it   stands up as any of it is true will you   consider your position would you think   this study published fake nudes in all   the problems   in the election what reforms you   recommend for this industry here well I   don't recommend reforms I recommend   people that are that have some moral   compass you know I've been hearing more   and more about a thing called fake news   and then talking about people to go and   fail all sorts of things but I will tell   you some of the media outlets that I   deal with the fake news more so than   anybody i could name them but i won't   bother but you have a few sitting right   in front of us so they're very very   dishonest people but i think it's just   something we're going to have to live   with I guess the advantage I have is   that i can speak back when it happens to   somebody that doesn't have this doesn't   have that kind of a megaphone that they   can't speak back it's a very sad thing   I've seen people destroyed I've seen   people absolutely destroyed and I think   it's very unfair so all I can ask for is   honest reporters yes very clear about   what you're saying do you trust your you   officials and what do you say to foreign   policy experts who say you're actually   weakening national security by waging   this war of words against that community   intelligence agencies are vital and very   very important we are going to be   putting in as you know mr. Pompeo and   others you know the senator dan coats   we're going to be putting in some   outstanding people within 90 days   they're going to be coming back to me   with a major report on hacking I want   them to cover this situation I also want   them however to cover maybe most   importantly because we have by if Utley   you know the United States our   government out of a list of 17 in terms   of industries is the worst it's number   17 in terms of protection if you look at   the retail industry if you look at the   banking industry various industries out   of 17 industries they put this in the   category of an industry the United   States is last in terms of protecting   let's say hacking defense like we had a   great hacking defense at the Republican   National Committee that's why we weren't   act by the way we were tall they were   trying to help us but they were enabled   and I think I get some credit because I   told rights and rights at a phenomenal   job but I said I want strong hacking   defense the Democratic National   Committee didn't do that maybe that's   why the country wrote so badly that way   but i will tell you wait wait wait let   me finish within 90 days we will be   coming up with a major report on hacking   defense how do we stop this new   phenomena fairly new phenomena because   the united states is hacked by everybody   that includes russia and china and   everybody everybody okay   go ahead good you said just now that you   believe that Russia in the deed was   responsible for the hacking of the DNC   and down to this is emails etc oh right   but you know what could have been others   also but why did you spend weeks   undermining the US intelligence   community before simply getting the   facts and then making a public thing I   think it's pretty sad when intelligence   reports get bleep down to the press I   think it's pretty safe first of all it's   illegal you know these are these are   classified and certified meetings and   reports I'll tell you what does happen i   have many meetings with intelligence and   every time i think people are reading   already somebody's linking it up so   there's it maybe it's my office maybe my   office i have a lot of people a lot of   great people maybe it's dead and what I   did is I said I won't tell anybody have   a meeting and I won't tell anybody about   my meeting with intelligence and what   happened is I had my meeting nobody knew   not even gonna my executive assistant   for years she didn't know I didn't tell   nobody knew the meeting was had the   meeting was over they left and   immediately the word got out that I had   a meeting so I don't want that I don't   want that looks very unfair to the   country it's very unfair to our country   what's happened that report should have   never first what you have been printed   because it's not worth the paper it's   written nor and I think the New York   Times was saying that I think a lot of   different people for saying that but I   will tell you that you never ever happen   okay   Thank You mr. president-elect can you   stand here today once and for all and   say that no one connected to you or your   campaign have any contact with Russia   leading up to or during the presidential   campaign and if you and II do believe   that Russia was behind the hacking what   is your message to Vladimir Putin right   now you shouldn't be doing it you won't   be doing it Russia will have much   greater respect for our country when I'm   leading it then what other people have   let it you will see them Russia will   respect our country more he should have   done it I don't believe you'll be doing   it more now we have to work something   out but it's not just questioning take a   look at what's happened you don't   reported the same way 22 million   accounts were hacked it has got you my   China and that's because we have no   defense that's because we love my people   that don't know what they're doing   Russia will have far greater respect for   our country what I'm waiting it and I   believe my hope maybe it won't happen   it's possible but I won't be give it a   little reset button or like Hillary here   press this piece of plastic that looked   at her like what is she doing there's no   recently we really going to get along   for what not I hope we get along but if   we don't that's possible too but Russia   and other countries and other countries   including China which is taking total   advantage of us economically totally   advantage of us in the South China Sea   by building their massive fortress total   Russia China Japan Mexico all countries   will respect us far more far more than   they do under past administration   in fact every night so what this is all   just so you understand these papers say   because I'm not sure that was explained   properly but these papers are all just a   piece of the many many companies that   are being put into trust to be run by my   two sons and I hope at the end of eight   years I'll come back and I'll say oh you   did a good job otherwise if they do a   bad job I'll say you're fired sir come   on RD Donati I'm sorry did not answer   whether any of your associates were in   contact with the Russians sir you did   not answer you did not answer whether   any of your associates were in contact   with the Russians can you categorically   deny that did not happen serve can you   categorically deny that did not happen   sir   ah   a bit frightened center   support unlike the Russian hostage   can you categorically   Sean he was attacking our news   organization   right here   [Music]   the search for the first time certainly   at least at one point three cents left a   bit ago but later in the touch Congress   be either on again then maybe others   were involved as well praised President   Putin of Russia for the statement he put   out tonight today denying any   involvement with this other dossier and   putting President Putin on notice as   well in the end a lot to sort through   there a lot to sort through George edit   but really this really is the first time   he said Russia is behind the hacking he   did say President Putin shouldn't have   done that but said we may have a good   relationship we may not said President   Putin wouldn't be hacking again and   again blamed the DNC because they were   not prepared for those kinds of hacks he   talks about the United States being much   more prepared we don't really know   whether he's talking about private   companies he's talking about the grid   certainly he wants that reinforced but   but some fairly strong words about   Russia certainly stronger than he has   had before and yet said others are   hacking as well China's hacking as well   he said he will have his new director of   the CIA and the DNI look at that hacking   and prepare a report for him about   what's going on and how this nation can   defend itself and Pierre Thomas would   also came up at the press conference is   the the idea that the intelligence   agencies including the FBI perhaps still   looking at these allegations that were   presented to mr. Trump last week he said   they're not going to find anything but   boy it's got to complicate his   relationship with these agencies when   he's been using language like this at   the press conferences and the   investigations may still be continuing   absolutely Georgian one of the   relationships that will have to pay   close attention to of the people that   briefed him last week the DNI Director   of National Intelligence the CIA the FBI   director is the person that is a   ten-year term about seven years   remaining that's the relationship to   watch it's clearly a very sensitive time   between the intelligence community and   the president-elect one that bears   watching for sure let's talk about the   other major subject the press conference   this how the president going to deal   with this potential conflicts of   interest he brought up his lawyers there   to talk about the plan that he's put in   place Rebecca Jarvis the president   sighs again and again that he is not   subject to the laws he does there's no   law that is requiring him to get to   create any kind of firewall with his   businesses even had that extraordinary   moment where he said he was offered a   two billion dollar deal over the weekend   and he said he could have accepted it   with Dubai and he turned it down so what   he laid out here is that he will be   entirely putting the business the Trump   Organization into a trust run by his   sons he said repeatedly that there would   be this firewall in place but he would   not be doing any new foreign deals no   future foreign deals and that there will   be an ethics advisor on hand to review   all deals here in the United States   going forward he also mentioned what we   were talking about with the emoluments   clause inside of the Constitution that   officials may not accept gifts that they   will be donating all profits from   foreign governments to his hotel to   Treasury now some ethics experts that   we've been talking to point out well   there are other issues involved because   it's not just donald trumps hotels there   are other financial engagements that   Donald Trump has for example with   sovereign wealth funds with loans what   happens to that money finally the   biggest question is Russia it comes back   to the question of Russia we would only   really truly be able to find out about   the Donald Trump organizations   involvement in Russia by seeing those   tax returns Russian loans impregnated

are the   welders young and old rich and poor   black white is stunning but above all   else we're Americans and that's the   support   [Applause]   heard this word and while my opponent   Hillary Clinton I   how many years have we been saying this   name you know I keep hearing that you   want to do this she wants to do that   where is he meant for 35 years he's been   doing this   where has she been my opponent slanders   you as deplorable   and a word that has it been picked up to   the same extent irredeemable that means   you can't be made better or whatever   that means you're always going to be   deplorable right I don't think so I   don't think so I told you hard-working   American patriots who love your family   and love your country and you want is   you want to see it be better   [Applause]   Hillary Clinton's comments and they were   angry comments as you see her making   this I was watching I was starting to   fall asleep watching because it's hard   to stay awake his face so I'm starting   to doze off and then I heard the word   deplorable Isis whoa an eerie capable   thinkable but her comments display the   same sense of arrogance and entitlement   that led her to violate federal law   secretary say hi and delete 33,000 email   think of it 33,000 but it really had to   do with yoga and the wedding yo so what   do we do we give yoga 5 and the wedding   three right where the rest of them   destroy your phones and think it is with   a hammer bomb 13 fo put classified   information in the reach of our enemies   lie to Congress and sell government   failures and access to cells government   favors and access it's the same attitude   of arrogance and entitlement that   explains why she has never taken   accountability for the disaster she   created in the Middle East what you're   seeing is largely a creation of Barack   Obama and Hillary Clinton   before she came into office Libya was   stable Syria was under control right   just said it Iraq was seeing a reduction   in violence and Iran was being totally   choked off by sanctions they were not   they were not going to make it the group   we today and you see today we call Isis   this is the group that was formed we   call Isis and it was close to being   extinguished now after Hillary here's   what we have Libya Syria and Iraq are a   total chaos Iran is on the path to   nuclear weapons and is becoming not a   local power but a world power so fast   how fast is the second they were dying   two years ago look what's happened and   remember the four hundred million in   cash well that turned out to be wrong   I'm sorry it turned out to be one point   seven billion in cash   how can you imagine can you imagine the   scene of 1.7 billion in cash different   denominations I mean the whole thing is   so it wasn't 400 min ago is 1.7 billion   who does this where were these people   coming from and now you look at Iran and   they're emboldened they want to shoot   down our airplanes you see with the   little boats going around our ships you   see that and talking and talking they   feel emboldened after all of this oh boy   oh boy oh boy is going to be so   different folks I promise   [Applause]   do you imagine the captain on the   destroyer as they keep circling with his   little boats he wants to shoot them out   of the water so bad he was standing   there like this just looking just   looking saying what is going on where   have we where have we come in God Isis   is spreading everywhere and launching   attacks against the West her judgment on   the economy is so bad Hillary's donors   and advises of the same people who gave   us after the worst trade deal in the   history of our country in the history of   our world there is never been a trade   deal as bad as dr. anywhere in the world   you look at upstate New York you look at   new england you look at colorado you   look at the manufacturing that's been   ripped out of Ohio and Pennsylvania and   everywhere and it's gone to Mexico and   other places and I tell this story   because i have a friend better than a   consultant it costs me nothing he is a   great guy he bills plans and I said to   him how are you doing he said I'm doing   unbelievably we're building the greatest   plants in the world where he said to   Mexico what about our country not so   much it's going to change folks going to   go the opposite believe   nail out China the entry into the World   Trade Organization you see where that   gun and now she wants to approve   trans-pacific partnership this will be   she called it the gold standard this   will be a disaster her policies have   produced suffering everywhere but   especially in our inner cities   forty-five percent of African Americans   under the age six are living in poverty   fifty-eight percent of african-american   youth are not employed more than 3,000   people have been shot in the city of   Chicago since January first can you   imagine by the way by the way that's   worse than Afghanistan that's worse than   these war-torn countries it's going   dangers the jobs are gone to schools to   Fallon the communities are totally   unsafe and to the African Americans   living in those communities I say vote   for Donald Trump what do you have to   lose what do I cause I will fix it I   will fix it I'll bring back your jobs   and your security and I'll fight for you   harder than anyone has ever fought   before   [Applause]   these cities have been run by the   policies of Hillary Clinton and her   friends and I'm telling you they're only   getting worse they're getting worse   every time she wants you vote and then   she said see you like in four years but   hopefully we're not going to be worried   about it is really sad it is really sad   what's happened to our inner cities they   want your vote and by the way the   Democrats have run them for 50 60 70   even a hundred years interrupted a   hundred years and look what you have I   will fix it remember that I will fix it   what do you have to lose somebody said   oh that's not a nice thing what he have   to lose how can you be any more accurate   than that what do you have to lose   everywhere she goes scandal and fan gear   follow just look at what she did in   upstate New York she promised 200,000   jobs and they ended up losing jobs   remember she was running for the Senate   it was a total disaster she said we're   going to bring jobs back it was a tote   she didn't bring anything with us jobs   the only people she delivers for are her   daughters I'm going to deliver for the   American people I promise   [Applause]   and I'm spending my money in this race   folks I'm spending my money I've got a   lot of time energy and my money invested   that's for sure   so that includes lifting the   restrictions we have to do this on   American energy there's 50 trillion   domes of untapped energy reserves in our   country and we're going to unlock that   vast potential   [Applause]   that's going to be an amazing unlocking   to believe me this one action alone will   raise the quality of life for tens of   millions of Americans will be a rich   country again we'll start paying off our   debt will lower your taxes it's going to   be a very beautiful thing to watch   [Applause]   we're also going to completely reformed   our trade deals for ford motor company   just announced they're moving all of   their small car division they're moving   where are they moving they're moving to   Mexico   this won't happen if I'm elected   president believe me people are not   going to be sealing our companies and   we're not going to be losing our jobs   out of somebody like Ford or carrier or   all of these thousands of companies that   are moving if they think they're going   to move fire all of their employees so   we get unemployment that we get no text   they're going to make product and brand   new plants is another country selling   into our country again and remember this   it will not be crossing a very very   strong boy okay very sure we're going to   charge them a thirty-five percent tax on   their product and you know what they're   gonna say they're going to say we're not   moving because if we have to do that no   longer makes sense to move and the   politicians could have done it they   could have done it they don't want to do   it because they're controlled by special   interests folks it's very simple   meanwhile if we just stop China from   stealing our intellectual property alone   we've saved two million jobs a year we   don't even talk to China about it right   now our trade deficit e goods all over   the world is nearly 800 billion dollars   a year think of it who makes these deals   who makes these this we have a trade   deficit of 800 billion dollars a year   and then they say I'm against Rick while   I'm against deals like that i can tell   you   you better work I mean to better off   without it this subtracts from our GDP   our economy grew only one point one   percent in the last quarter and that's a   catastrophe if China goes down to seven   or eight percent it's like a national   emergency we have 1.1 percentage to the   fact this is the weakest sup called   recovery since the Great Depression   another 14 million people have left the   workforce and entitled it all came in   entire since President Obama came into   office another major reform is going to   be school choice I've outlined a plan to   provide every disadvantaged child in   America to choose the private-public   magnet or religious school of his or her   choice for those of you that believe in   education like I do this will help with   millions of African American and   Hispanic children out of poverty since   President Obama came into office another   two million Hispanic Americans have   fallen into poverty this is unacceptable   to the Hispanic community I say we are   going to protect your jobs we are going   to build up your schools and we are   going to deliver safety and opportunity   to your children and you deserve   [Applause]   earlier this week

hell of a lot better off   than we are right now what a shame all   of the money but most importantly the   blood that death and what do we have now   we're in worse shape than we were 15   years ago by a factor of 10 and we spent   six trillion dollars six trillion that   seems to be the new number six trillion   much more importantly the lives that   we've lost because we're dealing with   incompetent people we're dealing with   stupid people we're dealing with people   like Robert Gates that don't have a clue   and then when they leave office they   criticize everybody I don't like critics   I don't like British I like the people   that get it done and get it done right   [Applause]   we need to create a new inclusive and   prosperous future we can do that jobs   will return it

I'm fighting for you   believe me I am fighting one of the   first things we're going to do is   restore law and order to our country we   have to do it our good friend sheriff   Clark with us tonight I want to thank   him for being here and I want to thank   our great mayor of New York Rudy   Giuliani did a great job so loyal new   FBI statistics just released show that   homicide Rose fifteen percent last year   in America's large cities it's the   largest single year increase in 45 years   more than three you're right   [Applause]   more than 3,000 people have been shot in   Chicago since January short period of   time 3,000 people homicides are up   nearly fifty percent in Washington DC   and more than sixty percent in Baltimore   across the entire nation for cities of   all sizes small and large the homicide   rates rose by more than ten percent last   year I assume they'll fact check this   boat I got it right out of the books you   know they even said I was wrong when I   said that Hillary Clinton is going to   allow five hundred percent more people   come in from Syria and other parts then   Obama they said he's wrong he's wrong he   lied he's wrong it wasn't five hundred   percent more it was five hundred and   fifty percent more so anything they can   do Oh as the media dishonest how   dishonest are these people Kristen   Allison   unbelievable not all not all but a big   big fat percentage so we're in a   national crisis yet my opponent Hillary   Clinton continues to attack the police   first she calls our supporters many of   them cops soldiers firefighters   deplorable and irredeemable then in our   debate this week she accuses the entire   country including all of law enforcement   of implicit bias essentially suggesting   that everyone including our police are   basically racist and prejudiced you   heard that and I'm standing there in   front of this massive crowd of people we   broke the record you know that I'm very   honored to a broker the record and I   said to myself did she really say that   she said it it's a bad thing she said   maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her   comments to herself after all she's the   one who described young african-american   men as super predators right super   predators and they have not been happy   about that for a long time how can   Hillary Clinton try to lead this country   when she has such a low opinion of its   citizens how can she lead this country   when she thinks America is full of   racists deplorable and irredeemable   you're not irredeemable you're not   irredeemable you're not deplorable boy   look at this crowd right into every   little corner even up there wow this is   something   and you know what folks it's this way   all over the country look back there   people trying to get it it's this way   all over the country because people are   disgusted with our government they're   sick and tired of what's going on when   they see our president authorized four   hundred million dollars in cash for   world terrorists and then it turns out   to be wrong it wasn't four hundred   million it was 1.7 billion dollars in   cash that Hall section of the room   wouldn't be able to handle it and then   where they're going to deport 800 people   last week you saw this they're going to   deport him I guess they had a reason   they couldn't have been perfect they're   going to deport 800 people and something   went wrong and instead of deporting them   800 people became citizens but that what   you did you see that but that wasn't the   bad part the bad part was that the 800   number was wrong now they think it's   1800 not 800 we are being run by   incompetent people we are being run by   people that don't know what they're   doing and in my opinion Hillary Clinton   is the most incompetent of all   so true   by smearing tens of millions of   hard-working decent Americans she's   rendered herself unfit to be President   she is unfit to be President all you   have to do is go back home and watch   what happened today when they were   talking about the email scandal and you   look at what happened with the FBI   testifying the director and you look at   what happened today with the FBI   director testifying and you'll say this   is not the country that we know and love   what's happening to our country is a   shame Hillary Clinton lacks the   character and judgment to hold public   office Bernie Sanders said that she has   bad judgment she has nothing but   hostility in her heart for hardworking   Americans of all backgrounds who just   want to live in safety security and   peace the police officers she attacks   are the same people of all colors   nationalities who race into danger every   day to save the lives of totally   complete strangers people they've never   met me   those fostering the dangerous   anti-police atmosphere in this country   shared directly in the blame for the   violence and chaos that threatens our   most vulnerable citizens my agenda of   reducing crime will benefit all   Americans but those who will benefit   most or african-american and Hispanic   American citizens living in high-crime   communities   and people in Milwaukee they're going to   love Donald Trump we're going to have   safety we're going to have safe we're   going to have saved we're going to save   thousands of lives the special interest   the arrogant media and the political   insiders don't want me to talk about the   crime that's happening in our country   and in our inner cities they don't want   you to know about the hurt and pain   that's happening to our fellow citizens   they want me to just go along with the   same failed policies that have caused so   much needless suffering and so much   preventable heartache well I have news   for the people trying to silence me and   you and everybody else not going to   happen whee whee whee it's all about we   this is a movement folks this is a   movement like they've never seen in this   country before this is a movement that   they've never seen before we will never   back down from fighting to save American   lives I will never back down from   fighting to save America's inner cities   the only people Hillary Clinton ever   fights for are the special interests who   write checks for her big fat beautiful   checks I don't know if you saw that one   report came out that she is going to   have commercials very dishonest   commercials the commercial she's put   sonar very very dishonest a little bit   of them's right but for the most part   very very dishonest did you see it 50 to   150 21 mean even now I turn on the   television I long to see an ivory snow   commercial long but with her it's about   follow the money remember that phrase   check it out on the internet check it   out it's really trending big-league   follow the money Hillary Clinton has   been a disaster for so many communities   but especially for african-american   communities I don't think   african-americans are going to   out and vote for Clinton they're too   smart and they know they're being used   they know it they also know that she'll   do nothing for them once the election is   over she never does and that will never   ever change same thing goes for Hispanic   voters they're tired of being used by   people like Hillary Clinton that have no   intention of doing anything for them   once the election is over fifty eight   percent of african-american youth are   not working there's another shooting in   Chicago every two hours every two hours   forty-five percent of african-american   children under the age of six are living   in poverty the inner cities have been   left behind crime is through the roof   public education is a total disaster   there are no jobs it's dangerous to walk   down the street with your child to the   african-american community I say what   the hell do you have to lose I will fix   it vote for me I will fix it I will   fight for you hotter than anyone has   ever fought for you before   thank you everything you need to know   about Hillary Clinton can be understood   with that simple phrase that we just use   yes crooked is another one but I wasn't   referring to that again we're saying   follow the money the large corporations   who support terrible trade deals that   offshore jobs they're donating big big   money to Hillary Clinton follow the   money the Wall Street investors who have   rigged the regulations against the   middle class they're donating to Hillary   Clinton follow the money the wealthy   donors who want to shut down American   energy they're donating to crooked   Hillary Clinton follow the money to   special interests who want open borders   for cheap later and you see what's   happening you see what's happening with   real unemployment not the phony   unemployment numbers that you read real   unemployment people that can't get jobs   and have given up looking for jobs   follow the money she and her financial   backers will say anything do anything   lie about anything by the way did   anybody ever lie so much as she lied   about her phony e-mails did anybody in   front of United States Congress by the   way to keep their grip on power to keep   their control over this country in her   campaign for president Hillary Clinton   has received 100 million dollars in   contributions from Wall Street and hedge   funds and folks I'm spending my money   I'm spending a lot but we're being   helped by the small donors and yesterday   because of the tremendous success of the   debate we raised almost 18 million   dollars which is a record for   amazing one day 18 million in one day   18 million dollars in one day she   received 4.1 million dollars for   speaking fees from financial firms and   she doesn't speak well his face you know   she came here instead of this massive   crowd that's pouring outside never she'd   probably have what 300 people what she's   coming isn't she coming tomorrow or the   next see how many people see how many   people here she and Bill received a   total of 150 million dollars in speaking   fees from special interest since bill   left office it's all part of the rigged   system being run at your expense the   same groups paying bill and hillary for   their speeches were lobbying the federal   government 22 groups paying bill clinton   for speeches lobby the State Department   while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of   State and don't forget that Clinton   contributors who were appointed to   advisory boards by Secretary Clinton or   all of the favors of access granted to   those who provided funds she even gave   up twenty percent of america's uranium   supply to Russia to Russia you know what   people do with uranium don't you it's   called nuclear twenty percent could have   never done it without her she put the   office of Secretary of State up for sale   and if she ever got the chance she'd put   the Oval Office up for sale also she   deleted and bleached a very expensive   process thirty-three thousand emails   after after a congressional subpoena was   served not before she deleted remember   33,000 and bleached after after it was   they get the subpoena they say oh wow   here's a subpoena let's delete all of   the emails if you're being sued by your   neighbor and you do that you know   what happens to you right   13 phones 13 has does anybody in this   room like over the last number of years   as anybody in this room at 13 phones   okay a number of them were hammered to   death right they were hammered so let me   ask you has anybody when you get rid of   your phone hammered it raise your hand   10 this one guy what business are you in   what business I want to get him out of   here I don't want to be near her   staffers taking the Fifth Amendment   think of this over and over and her   ringleaders getting immunity deals okay   five people including the guy that put   in the illegal server right I want the   Fifth Amendment I want immunity the   reason they get immunity is because they   did something wrong they didn't do   anything wrong they don't think in terms   of immunity five people folks I'm   telling you nobody's ever seen anything   like this in this country's history in   these countries history you want America   Beck I want America back   sad it said unbelievable it's   unbelievable but it said remember this   people's lives have been destroyed   ruined for one little fraction of what   she's done you can look at General   Petraeus you can look at others their   lives have been destroyed for doing   something so much less two percent five   percent ten percent and you look at what   happened with her it's a disgrace   foreign enemies with easy access to   hacker server that's what happened   people had easy access it was on other   people's phones it was all over the   place very important information all   over lies to Congress under oath about   turning over her work-related emails the   American people have had it with years   and decades of Clinton scandals and   their total corruption their total   corruption   this year will be the year the American   people say enough is enough it's going   to be november eighth get out and vote   Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the   special interest trying to strip this   country of its wealth its jobs and its   status as a sovereign nation does   anybody think that our nation is   respected like it once was she's a   globalist who has made a career of   taking jobs from our country and giving   them to other countries I am not running   to be President of the world I'm running   to be President of the United States   from now on it's going to be America   first these special interests totally   control Hillary Clinton she's their   chosen representative you can disregard   everything she says and just remember   that phrase follow the money she's there   for only one reason to protect her   donors and collect money look just take   a look her career just look what she   done for other people she's failed in so   many different things and the other   night at the debate it hit me more than   it's ever hit me she's saying what she's   going to do here she couldn't make an   answer on the police it was a horrible   answer she didn't want to say law and   order she didn't want to go too far   anyway so she's trying to weave a little   pattern and I said to myself you know   she's been talking about these things   for 30 years think of it 30 years and   nothing gets done   [Applause]   oh well they have a right to do that   don't they one person and tomorrow   headlines protester right she's failed   at everything she failed in Iraq in   Libya in Syria in Iran in Egypt she   failed on Isis in fact she unleashed   Isis unto the world by leaving a vacuum   that should have never been left along   with President Obama that doesn't have a   clue she failed in upstate New York   promising 200,000 jobs but instead the   jobs kept leaving she never produced the   jobs she ran I'll never forget it she   ran for the Senate and she talked about   jobs jobs the day she got elected that   was the end of job she couldn't have   cared less all she did was named during   her whole term a post office a highway   and something else three names she fell   the inner city she failed women and   children the only people Hillary Clinton   has ever delivered for our her donors   our campaign is taking on big business   big media and big donors we're taking   them on for you that's why I'm into this   thing for our many millions where am i   over 60 million now over 6000 am I going   to feel badly if a November rave can you   imagine you know one of the commentators   the other day said it doesn't matter if   Trump wins or loses it's been one of the   most incredible things we've ever seen   politically he said it's a political   phenomenon he said to myself no no no if   we don't win it will be one of the great   waste of time energy and money certainly   in my life that I can tell you certainly   in my life we have to win I'm not owned   or controlled by anybody my loyalty is   to you and to nobody else   nobody else I will fight for you my   economic agenda can be summed up in   three to me very very beautiful words   jobs jobs jobs and we're going to bring   back our jobs we will cut your taxes   she's going to raise your taxes we will   reduce substantially regulations which   are killing people and killing the   farmers and killing the energy companies   and I've seen them and they are   ridiculous okay we're going to cut them   she's going to increase them we are   going to negotiate great great trade   deals and we're going to do things with   NAFTA because NAFTA signed by her   husband will go down as the single worst   trade deal not in the history of our   country probably in the history of the   world that's how bad it is we're going   to unleash American energy and we're   going to repeal and replace Obamacare   which is a total disaster   [Applause]   we are also going to end common core and   offer school choice to every   disadvantaged child including every poor   Hispanic and african-american child in   America we will put every kid on the   ladder of American success a great   education and a great job that they love   going to early every morning they're   going to love it there is nothing   nothing like a great job the people   getting rich off the rigged system and   remember i use that a long time now it's   become commonplace the word rigged   system I use that when I was winning   states and getting less delegates than   the people I was beating but I didn't   let it go on for long did I we changed   our rigged system and hence you we are   and we are going to make sure that the   people throwing all of these hundreds of   millions of dollars at Hillary Clinton   aren't going to get their way okay our   campaign is about breaking up the   special interest monopoly in Washington   DC we're trying to disrupt the collusion   between the wealthy donors the large   corporations the media executives we're   going to be able to do it they're all   part of the same rig political   establishment they go to the same   restaurants they attend the same   conferences they have the same friends   actually I'm one of them in a few cases   sorry about that and they all are in for   a big reckoning on november eighth a big   big big

look at my   projects in New York and around the   world where I revitalize neighborhoods   and really lifted up skylines and I'm   not saying that as a bragging thing the   New York posted a fantastic article   recently I'm saying it because that's   the kind of thinking we need in our   country the world is ripping us off   folks the world is ripping us off but   that's what I want to do for our country   I want to go into every neighborhood and   lock their potential for all of our   people not just a group for all of our   people together we can accomplish   anything we want but that means showing   up you gotta show up I don't care if you   are so sick you get out of bed you just   get out of bed you crawl into the   bathroom you put on that shirt or   whatever you're

down the   escalator with melania you never saw so   many reporters you never saw so many   cameras and I said it took a deep breath   I say we have to do it you look at the   Iran deal you look at our military being   hurt so badly it's being depleted our   jet fighters they go to graveyards they   go to play in graveyards and museums to   get parts because they don't make the   parts anymore this so old this is the   United States of America we have to   rebuild our we don't have a choice this   isn't like let's think about it our   military is depleted our people are the   greatest people on earth we're going to   give them the kind of equipment not to   use hopefully that when the enemy looks   at us they're saying we're not going to   mess with them okay we don't want to use   it we don't want to use it so we have   six weeks to make every dream you ever   dreamed for your country come true you   have one last magnificent chance to   deliver justice for every forgotten man   and forgotten woman and child in this   nation don't let it slip away we have   one chance this is it we don't have four   more years we don't have four more years   they'll start appointing justices of the   Supreme Court remember that supreme   court jester we lost a great one judge   Scalia we can't let it slip away I don't   believe I really mean this I don't   believe we're ever going to have this   chance again I don't believe this is it   and it's tough it's tough the odds were   really against us remember the odds I   started at one percent I went to three   percent I went to six percent i went to   twenty percent today somebody put down   very respected the odds fifty-four   percent and i think their bias   but I don't say that I always like to   say forty percent I don't want to talk   about it assume it's 40 okay we don't   have to brag about odds let's assume   it's 40 okay let's go out and win   because the only thing that matters is   to stand up and be heard for your family   for your city for your country the   arrogance of Washington DC will soon   come face to face with the righteous   verdict of the American voter when   november eight we're going to show the   whole world that America is back bigger   and better and stronger than ever ever   ever before right here is just some of   the things that will happen starting in   January of 2017 I'm going to lower your   taxes massively Hillary Clinton is going   to raise your taxes and she says it   we're going to eliminate all of the   unnecessary regulation some we need we   need for the environment we need for   safety but there's so much it's become a   big business Hillary Clinton wants to   add more and more regulation we're going   to repeal and replace Obamacare we're   going to unleash American energy we're   going to end illegal immigration   we're going to build the wall and Mexico   is going to pay for the wall one hundred   percent   and we're going to have great relations   with Mexico we don't have them right now   and they're ripping us off I mean their   leaders are much smarter than arts to   put it nicely look we have massive trade   deficits with Mexico they're making a   fortune I'm not even talking about on   the border what's happening there we   have massive trade deficits they will   pay for the wall a hundred percent it's   one-way street you saw a ford motor   company they're going to make all of   their small cars you know what that   means all of this small car is going to   be made in Mexico you look at all of the   company's carrier air conditioning I   could read as you're standing here   they're negotiating deals to take   companies out of our country and move   them to Mexico a friend of mine builds   plants he's one of the biggest in the   world and he tells me how well he's   doing in Mexico he's building some of   the greatest plants anywhere in the   world in Mexico what about the United   States well not so much not going to   happen that way we're going to reverse   it and we're gonna have a great   relationship with Mexico and the Mexican   people are amazing I have so many   friends the Mexican people are amazing   people but what's happening is their   leadership and what they've been doing   to us for so many years it's incredible   that we can allow people to get away   we're not going to have a country our   manufacturing is cut you go up to New   England you go to New York State where   Hillary Clinton failed so badly you go   to places here you go to Pennsylvania   you go to Ohio you go to Florida take a   look at what's going on we can also keep   radical Islamic terrorists out of our   country   we're going to save the Second Amendment   we're going to support the men and women   of

power our nation again American workers   will be hired to do the job we will put   new American steel into the spine of our   country I will fight every day for   neglected parts of this nation and I   will fight to bring us all together   unify as Americans imagine what our   country could accomplish if we started   working together as one people under one   God saluting one American flag   it's time to break with the bitter   failures of the past that we have had   tremendous failures we don't want any   more when was the last time you saw our   country win look at the ship we had with   the people from Iran and their little   dinghies circling circling taunting   daunting or they grabbed our ten sailors   because they're a little bit in their   waters or they fly near our planes   they're taunting us they become   emboldened because they don't respect us   and they don't respect our leader we're   going to enhance and we're going to   really make our country and I mean that

time New York suffered a tragedy Donald   Trump was there   it's not gonna like my channel you this   are you getting anonymously police   officer   I don't think they're telling pictures   because why I look at all of the little   rallies I think we're going to do very   well with women for Trump thank you   in 18 days we're going to win the state   of North Carroll   the way   our bullets have spent more money than   ever before in history on this campaign   they've raised it from special interests   and yet we are leaving in three recent   polls it just came out over the last day   los angeles times that investors   business daily question long as I the   way the last a Kelly most well he did   pole and by the way life cycle was as   they tell me the most accurate pole of   the last cycle so that's a good sign   that's a good sign because I honestly I   believe we're going to win this is   what's going to happen this is what's   going on we have two great congressman   in the group and they tell me what's   going on in their districts it's   unbelievable their area is unbelievable   Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee is here   someplace where's Jimmy dalka Jimmy   incredible guy and he said you won't   believe what's happening in Tennessee   and Mark meadows did you ever hear her   walk better   and much more importantly his wife the   real leader in the family right thank   you mark thank you for being here thank   you both very much these are great   people but they're just telling me the   level of excitement and the people   coming out I think we're going to have   beyond jus brexit I think we'll go it   beyond brexit you know about front I   think we're going to have for early   voting is underway so make sure you send   in your ballot we cannot take a chance   of blowing it we can not take a chance   we have something with so close it's a   movement like they've never seen in this   country before never ever seen don't   blow it on November a together we're   going to deliver real change that puts   America first we're going to renegotiate   our terrible trade deals and illegal   immigration stop the massive inflow of   refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes   and regulations over   and Hilary is going to raise your taxes   big-league you've seen that   we're going to unleash job producing   American energy rebuild our military and   take care of our veterans who have not   been taken   and of course one of the true staples to   my campaign and I say to our campaign   repeal and replace Obamacare   your jobs will come back under a trump   administration your incomes will go up   under a trump administration your taxes   will go way way down under a trump   administration your companies won't be   leaving North Carolina under a trump   administration there will be   consequences for them we will be strong   and a really strong and powerful nation   again our military is so depleted we're   going to build it up America has grown   weak and so weak that the Philippines   have broken with decades of pro American   foreign policy to instead leave for the   orbit of China and Russia you saw that   yesterday the hatred I mean why is Obama   campaigning he ought to be out working   he ought to be out   I mean I'm going to send the congressman   back to Washington with that message but   we'll send the real message on november   eighth right sent the wrong message on   my body but every time I look at it he's   campaigning I mean here you see the   Philippines the heads of the Philippines   is so angry he leaves the China he's now   negotiating with China we've been to the   Philippines practically for forever a   very important strategic ally and what   happens China and Russia are probably   going to take it and I see him out there   campaigning for crooked Hillary come on   strength will also require growth right   now our economy isn't growing at all we   had only around a one percent growth   last quarter GDP a disaster do you know   when China has one percent it's over   they don't have one percent they have   seven percent that's considered terrible   India has eight percent that's   considered bad for them they don't like   it we have one percent and everything's   supposed to be fine but we're going down   if Hilary gets in she's going to raise   your taxes and the one percent is going   to be negative and that's going to be   almost unheard of but that's going to   happen I made a lot of predictions if   that happens and if she gets in you're   going to have such negative growth you   will have problems like you've never had   before and our companies and our jobs   will flee believe me I'm going to get us   to four percent growth and create 25   million jobs over a ten-year period   many workers are earning less today than   they were 18 years ago they're working   harder and longer and then make it less   some of them are working two jobs and   even three jobs but still taking home   less pay than they were taking home 18   and 20 years ago but I'm working harder   to folks i will i am working on it   there's no doubt about it i've got three   stops today we've got three of these   today we got free   you know I've got three an occasion I   have four I think I have one rest day   where I have to but these are massive   rallies and we're going to do this for   another 19 days right up until the   actual vote of November rain and then I   don't know what kind of shape them in   but i'll be happy and at least i will   have known win lose or draw and i'm   almost sure if the people come out we're   going to win but I will be I will be   happy with myself because i always say i   don't want to think back if only i did   one more rally I would have one North   Carolina by 500 votes instead of losing   it by 200 votes right if only I did so I   never want to ever look back I never   want to say that about myself we have to   work you have to get everybody you know   out there companies like carrier are   firing their workers and moving to   Mexico Ford is moving all of its volk   our production announced two weeks ago   to Mexico that's on top of a two and a   half billion dollar plant that they   already built when I'm president if   companies want to fire their workers and   leave for Mexico or other parts of the   world there will be a tax of thirty-five   percent for any product they want to   ship   to this country   and you know what's going to happen   because I'm the free trader a lot of   people don't believe that I'm a free   trader but our politicians have made   such horrible trade deals that they're   killing our workers they're killing our   companies and our companies are being   forced to move including the fact the   taxes are so I but there will be   consequences and we're not going to lose   a company in North Carolina have them go   to Mexico or someplace else make their   products sell it back in here which we   will have a very strong border but Sela   through our border and there are no   consequences and I'll tell you what's   going to happen when we do this for   years our government has tried to stop   our companies for believing guess what's   going to happen then I can leave anymore   because all of a sudden it won't work if   they do at least we're going to make a   lot of money when they ship their   products across the border okay   the politicians have never you've never   even heard this you've heard it from me   over the last six months for me it was   so simple you want to move good luck   enjoy the heat but let me tell you when   you make your air conditioner you make   your car you do this you're going to   leave all those people unemployed there   are consequences you're going to pay a   terror for a tax Hillary Clinton is   raised countless millions of dollars and   they're not leaving from big donors who   want to ship our jobs to other countries   including millions of dollars from   corporations and countries pushing for   the next NAFTA the next horrible trade   deal it's called the trans-pacific   partnership don't let it happen that'll   be the rest of your job so we go the   rest of you just that's how our system   is corrupt and broken we're going to   take on big donors we're going to take   on big business and big media that have   enriched themselves at your expense and   I didn't need to do this folks and I was   part of the other side for a long time I   understand the game as well as anybody   as well as anybody but I saw the game   and I saw it firsthand and this country   has been great to me i love this country   and I said our country will not survive   if we continue to play that game so this   is always a tough thing to do but I'm   doing it and I am so invigorated by the   kind of reception I mean look at this to   the corners of   make America great again he's what we're   going to do it's all about making   America great again we're going to do it   and I understand it I understand it from   both sides believe me and I think you   know that thank you the media is so   corrupt that hillary was given the exact   questions to a previous debate to   remember this huh just recently word for   word given the questions here are the   questions here are the questions nobody   gave me the question now I don't know   what I do would i turn the people in or   what I take the questions she was given   the question I think I turned him and I   think I said wait a min what's going on   over here I want to know what she given   the questions to my debate but it   doesn't matter because we once okay they   stood everything we want i hope that   especially the last i think the first   one you know was fine i thought it was   good i mean i never did this stuff   before in all fairness but i think we   did well i think i think it was good at   the head they gave me you know this   great commission on public on   presidential debates they're wonderful   except they gave me a broken might but   that's okay i'm screaming into the mic   all night but i think the first one was   fine and i think we won easily the   second one and the third one was our   best right third one   but she was given the questions to a   debate by donna Brazile who is now under   pressure to resign she should be she   should resign but I ask you why didn't   Hillary say I can't do this I can't do   this I can't take I can't take these   questions nobody from the media is   asking that question why is it they're   putting a lot of pressure on Donna   Brazile she was on television the other   night that was brutal they're putting a   lot of pressure in her but tell me she   handed the questions to Hillary Hillary   read the questions figured out the   answers put whatever she had to do and   then why didn't she say I'm not allowed   to do this years ago years ago there was   a show called the   sixty-four-thousand-dollar question does   anybody remember don't say cuz it's all   real a contestant Charles go ahead why   correct Wow how do you know it look how   young this guy I can test it got the   questions in advance prior to the show   and his life was ruined but Hillary got   the questions in events and the press   doesn't even bring it up can you imagine   if I got the questions in advance and   they found out to you   can you imagine if I got the questions   and they found out they would reinvent a   much more sinister form of the electric   chair is era yoga feel but I have to ask   the press to find out why aren't they   asking Hilary why she didn't turn in the   people that gave her the answers and   those questions but this is even bigger   than what we're talking about because   we're playing for the presidency of the   United States Hillary is the most   corrupt politician ever to seat the   office of the presidency   well let's do this let's do this   november eighth let's win let's go win   we have lots of options but we got to   win what a waste of time if we don't   pull this off you know these guys have   said doesn't matter if you win or lose   there's never been a booklet like this   in the history of this country I say it   matters to me whether we want to lose   because so so I'll have over a hundred   million dollars of my own money in this   campaign so if I lose if I lose I will   consider this and the nice part about   saying that and I only tell you that   because that means I'm not taking all of   this money from all of these people that   Hillary's taking money and you know her   husband made 250 billion dollars i said   to the second debater said so why aren't   you putting five million 10 million 1525   what I'm putting it over a hundred why   aren't you putting in 10 million dollars   into your own campaign they're not   putting anything and we're fighting this   juggernaut because their billions of   dollars a phrase and we're fighting I   turned on the other day i was in florida   and i was in pennsylvania I turned on   the television it was ad after ad after   ed most of those ads were phony Ed's   most of the things that those ads were   false they were false I never said it   they know I didn't say they have   different things the way I won't go into   things because my people go crazy when   they say don't be particularly just I   liked it then I think like that because   but they say go talk about jobs but   these things are so false all of these   things is so close to such lies but   Hillary it's and after EDF   and all paid for by Wall Street and   special interests all pay and I'm saying   to myself i think they said in florida   the number of it's going to be 50 to 1   and we're tied in florida and i think   we're going to win flood   but the answer phone yet they're untrue   at mostly enter the little truth in   there but mostly and remember when   you're watching television you see one   of the thousands and thousands of EDS   just remember put Wall Street on top   it's Wall Street that's who paid for it   a largely paying for now from WikiLeaks   we've just learned she tried to get 12   million dollars from the King of Morocco   for an appearance more pay for play   that's why I'm proposing a path of   ethics reforms to make our government   honest once again   it's time to drain the swamp in   Washington DC   those reforms include the following a   five-year ban on White House and   congressional officials becoming   lobbyists after they leave government   sells a lifetime ban on white house   officials lobbying on behalf of a   foreign government thank you a complete   ban on foreign lobbyists raising money   for American elections additionally i'm   going to push for a constitutional   amendment to oppose term limits on all   members of god   not only will we end government   corruption but we will end economic   stagnation so important our country is   doing poorly my plan for the economy can   be summed up in three great beautiful   powerful words jobs jobs jobs they've   been taken away from   at the center of my jobs plan will be   fixing our terrible trade deals they are   terrible the most incompetent deals ever   made by the way NAFTA signed by Bill   Clinton thank you very much president Li   it's been a one-way highway into Mexico   for our jobs our case we get the drugs   they get the jobs and the cash 47   million Americans are living in poverty   and 45 million Americans are right now   in this country on food stamps we have   nearly an 800 billion dollar annual   trade deficit in goods with the world   and the worst so-called recovery since   the Great Depression North Carolina has   lost nearly half of its manufacturing   jobs since NAFTA half you've lost half   of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a   deal signed by Bill Clinton and strongly   supported by Hillary to listen to this   we've lost and I always say this it   sounded like a typographical error it's   not I thought it would be 700 7,000   we've lost seventy thousand factories   since china's entry into the World Trade   Organization another bill and hillary   backed deal   we're living through the greatest jobs   theft in the history of the world   nobody's ever lost jobs like this the   deal that she made with South Korea   who's going to bring us a hundred   thousand jobs no it's brought them a   hundred thousand jobs we've lost jobs we   don't win anymore by the way to get jobs   we don't win on anything anymore we   attack a city mosel we attack bosal I've   been reading about the attack for four   months the reason they want to attack it   a primary reason is to take the leaders   of Isis out because that's where they   think they are and I say whatever   happened to a surprise attack so I've   been reading about Mosul in the attack   and I talked about it at the debate did   everyone hear me talk about that during   the day and I said to myself how are you   going to get these people these are   tough smart people what you do is you do   a sneak attack or a surprise attack   right right with you predictable we will   attack mosel in three months from now we   are going to get their leaders because   we believe that's where they're staying   we believe here's Obama we believe they   are in bozo so in three or four months   let's see he goes three or four months   we will be attacking mosel because we   want to get the leaders of Isis okay   well in the meantime the following day   they're out of there there's spread all   over the place in the meantime have you   seen what's gone on it's much tougher   than we thought because now they're dug   in they're ready and it's much much   tougher than we thought General Douglas   MacArthur General George Patton who was   too mean and too tough today he couldn't   make it in the armed forces because   they'd say he's not politically correct   get a very foul mouth he used bad words   but his people loved him and his people   would die for him   but in a foul mouth but he won he would   win can you imagine him saying we're   going to be attacking mozo in four   months to see we get the leaders and   what they're finding is they gone I told   him that for months and what are you   mentioning is for now they would have   said we will never ever attack Mosul   mosel is I would never do this me out   because I always like to tell the truth   but somebody could say we will never   ever attack Muslim and then the next day   you hit them like you never hit anybody   I will I would not do it we have a bunch   of babies running our country folks we   have a bunch of losers they're losers   their babies we have a president all he   wants to do is campaign his wife all she   wants to do his campaign and I see how   much his wife likes Hillary but wasn't   she the one that originally started the   statement if you can't take care of your   home right you can't take care of the   White House of the country where's that   I don't hear that I don't hear that   she's the one that started that I said   we can't say that it's too vicious can   you believe it I said that we can't say   they said well Michelle Obama said it I   said she did now she said that but we   don't hear about that let me tell you if   Hillary Clinton gets elected we've got   four more years of Obama we have a   disaster we have Isis all over we won't   win any more and your taxes are going up   and she wants to double up and triple up   on Obamacare which has to be repealed   and replaced it's a disaster a trump   administration is going to renegotiate   NAFTA stand up for foreign cheating and   stop the jobs from leaving our country   we are going to start making things in   America again we are going to start   making things in North Carolina again we   are bringing back our jobs America first   remember that   in order to bring back manufacturing to   North Carolina Ohio Michigan   Pennsylvania and so many other places   we're going to undertake a major reform   of our federal bureaucracy American   trade policy is currently mismanaged by   dozens of competing bureaucracies spread   across the departments of agriculture   commerce labor state and Treasury and   the US Trade Representative has doesn't   know where he's going my administration   under it all trade policy will be   consolidated into one office it will   report to a thing called the American   desk and I'm going to be calling every   day like three times a day how are we   doing American desk American desk   the mission of the American desk will be   to protect the economic interests of the   American worker and the national   interests of the United States we are   losing our manufacturing all over the   country north carolina has been hit hard   almost the hardest but we've been losing   it all over the country folks it's   coming back and it's going to come back   faster there'll be a day soon soon   during my administration for years eight   years doesn't matter it's coming back   soon where Apple and other companies   like Apple are going to start making   their product in our country not in   China and Vietnam and all over them   America first as part of our plan to   bring back our jobs we're going to lower   our business tax from thirty five   percent to fifteen percent we're also   going to rebuild our inner cities   african-americans and Hispanics living   in inner cities are suffering gravely   you walk through these places and you're   with your child and you get shot there's   no education there are no jobs there's   no safety nearly 3,500 people have been   shot in Chicago since January first you   believe that 3005 that's worse than   these war zones were talking about   homicides are up nearly fifty percent in   Washington DC and more than sixty   percent in Baltimore and the murder rate   in the United States is the highest it's   been in 45 years and the dishonest media   they never tell you that and it's   getting worse so the conditions are   terrible and I say to the   african-american community and to the   Hispanic community and voters what do   you have to lose vote for Donald Trump I   will   I will fix it I will fix it and the   Democrats have been taking advantage of   the african-american community and the   Hispanic community for years they get   their vote and then they say we'll see   you in four years they don't do a damn   thing for them we're gonna fix it we're   going to make lives much better in this   country for everybody we will be a rich   nation once again but to be a rich   country we must also be a safe country   our national security at the border is a   mess very unsafe a very terrible   situation speaking and secret to a   foreign bank I will build the wall I   promise   speaking in secret to a foreign bank   Hillary Clinton said her dream is for   totally open trade there goes your   business and open borders there goes   your country there goes you know we love   WikiLeaks boy they have really WikiLeaks   they have revealed a lot they've   revealed that there's a great hostility   toward Catholics they revealed that   there's a great hostility toward   evangelicals any evangelicals in the   audience   well I've done great with evangelicals   including here where we won our primary   big but the evangelicals and the   Catholics and people of faith I think   they're going to be voting for us big   league I think they're going to be   running forever Hillary's plan includes   an open border with the Middle East   meaning generations of radicalism and   terrorism spreading and growing within   our shores so let me state this as   clearly as I can if I'm elected   president of the United States I am   going to keep radical Islamic terrorists   the hell out of our country   Oh   it's unbelievable they're letting people   come in from Syria and Hillary Clinton   wants to increase it by five hundred and   fifty percent and already thousands and   thousands this will be the great Trojan   horse remember this and we don't want to   be the generation we don't want to be   the people that in 200 years people are   laughing it for allowing it to happen we   will also stop the crisis of illegal   immigration a trump administration will   secure and defend our borders without   borders we do not have a country folks   we do not have a car we will build a   wall and Mexico will pay for the wall   Mexico has done very well in our back   they will pay for the world they're   making a tremendous amount of money off   of us you have to see the the lines i   was in Laredo Texas you have to see the   lines and lines miles long of trucks   pouring into Mexico and it's it's a   one-way street folks it's a one-way   street it's going to stop gotta stop and   I was with the President of Mexico three   months ago great guy really had a great   meeting but it can't go on like this   they can't continue to outsmart our   politicians and if it's me than not   going to outsmart us believe me we have   the first-ever endorsement from our ice   and Border Patrol officers first ever   first time they ever indoors at   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   allowed thousands of criminal aliens to   be released because their home countries   wouldn't take them back because they're   smart they don't want to take back   killers and drug dealers and all of the   people that were sending back it was   just reported and Hillary took if she   said all right look bring them back   bring them back they won't take a bring   them back we don't want to disturb one   of these contention that we practically   support we don't want to disturb them   believe me we're going to take these   people out day one the people that are   the criminals which is drug lords gang   members etc killers we're bringing them   back to their countries there will not   be one foreign country that won't say   Thank You mr. president for sending him   back thank you sir they'll be so happy   to get him and I don't mean that exactly   but the point is they're going to be   taken aback they're not coming back to   us that I could can you imagine she   didn't want to make waves she didn't   want to make way so we have these people   thousands all over our streets in our   cities it was just reported that a man   deported from our country 10 times in 6   years has been charged with raping a   twelve-year-old girl in August Texas   police arrested a serial illegal

Hz8jSguklFo~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160909~Full Speech: Donald Trump Speech at Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC (September 9, 2016) #VVS16~22907.0~4.7923078537~493.0~27.0~   and so it is with greatest honor and   greatest respect that I introduced to   you now the next president the United   States Donald Trump   he's such a great person and he's really   been with me a long time in a lot of   different ways he's been incredible so I   just want to thank John and I hope he   makes another movie very quickly because   I love his movies in particular I wanted   to thank our host Tony Perkins for years   of leadership and we know all about that   and we all express our support for Tony   as he deals with the aftermath of the   terrible floods in Louisiana where two   weeks ago I spent some time and I saw   some incredible incredible people they   said right thank you   amazing amazing people one of the   greatest privileges of my journey has   been the time I've spent with the   evangelical community and the support   they gave me in those primers was   absolutely incredible I have to tell you   across the nation a lot of people said I   wonder if Donald will get the   evangelicals I got the evangelicals I'm   gonna make it up to you too   you watch there are no more decent   devoted or selfless people than our   Christian brothers and sisters here in   the United States oh so true I've   witnessed that incredible generosity all   across this land gotten to know so many   people I saw during my trip to Louisiana   where Christian volunteers raced to help   their fellow citizens in need Franklin   Graham is an example he brought the most   incredible people and equipment to   Louisiana   and he didn't want anything for it   he's a great man it's that spirit of   giving that we will need to rebuild   Louisiana and to rebuild this country   which is in serious serious trouble   yet our meteor culture often mocks and   demeans people of faith than you   understand that all the time I hear from   concerned parents how much harder it is   for a Christian family to raise their   children in today's media environment it   is right isn't it yeah it is right   not even close your values of love   charity and faith built this nation so   how can it be that our media treats   people of faith so poorly one of the   reasons is that our politicians   have really abandoned you to a large   extent and Hillary Clinton you can   forget about her so let me stay this   right up front a trump administration   our Christian heritage will be cherished   protected defended like you've never   seen before believe me   [Applause]   I believe it and you believe it and you   know it you know and that includes   religious liberty remember remember I   recently had a chance to visit a church   in Detroit great faith Ministries   International stand up if you're a   member that's good that was a great that   was an amazing experience and the bishop   what a great guy   in my remarks I spoke about how African   American church and this is all across   the country for centuries have been the   conscience of our nation they're   unbreakable faith and spirit overcame   some of the most difficult periods in   our history leading us all to a better   future it's very true amazing this was   such an amazing experience this is the   power of faith it's the power to heal   it's the power to unite it's the power   to make all of us live better lives all   of us our nation today is divided nobody   likes to say it but we're living in a   very very divided nation it will be our   faith in God in his teachings in each   other that will lead us back to unity   [Applause]   each of us here today has a role to play   in bringing our country together United   in common purpose and in common values   so let's talk today about some of the   things and these are great things that   we can do together to create the   American future for everybody not just a   certain group of people but for   everybody the first thing we have to do   is give our churches their voice back   it's been taken away the Johnson   amendment has blocked our pastors and   ministers and others from speaking their   minds from their own pulpit if they want   to talk about Christianity if they want   to preach if they want to talk about   politics they're unable to do so if they   want to do it they take a tremendous   risk that they lose their tax-exempt   status all religious leaders should be   able to freely express their thoughts   and feelings on religious matters and I   will repeal the Johnson amendment   if I am elected your president I promise   so important   thank you that's so important and I must   tell you from the heart this started a   building of mine in Manhattan   I had fifty pastors in a big conference   room and we actually had fifty pastors   two rabbis a couple of prices we were   all talking and we were there for two   hours and at the end it was a love fest   we all agree it was like a love fest and   I said to them we were high up in a   building on Fifth Avenue and I said to   them I'd love your support and I know   when I can get support I'm quite   sophisticated and I know they wanted to   give me their total support a hundred   percent just like I had in the primers   and I said I really would like your   support and they didn't really know what   I was talking about and I said what's   going on here they said well so we can't   do that because we would be violating   the laws and I said what's the   punishment well we could lose our   tax-exempt status which of course is a   you know massive penalty I said tell me   about this and we sat down they talked   about it when did it happen 1954 or so   Lyndon Johnson was having problems   powerful guy I actually had don'twe you   have to gain respect for what he was   able to do can you imagine that this man   single-handedly he was having problems   with churches and there was a church in   Houston that was giving him a hard time   maybe very very good reason and he put   in an amendment that basically stopped   our great pastors and ministers and   others from talking under the penalty of   losing their tax-exempt status so we   were looking down onto the sidewalk and   there were people walking on the   sidewalk and I said so folks what you're   telling me is those people walking way   way down there on the sidewalk have   really more power than you do because   they're allowed to express their   feelings and thoughts openly and with   penalty and one of the pastors who I   knew very well and these are powerful   people these are strong people with   magnificent voices and just and   magnificent hearts much more importantly   they looked at me and they said that's   actually right they have more power than   we do we're not allowed to express and   that's what I said we have to start   thinking about this and I thought about   it and then we had a large group of   pastors again I said I have thought   about it if I become president we are   going to knock out the Johnson amendment   we are going to do that and it's not   gonna be hard it's not gonna be hard   when you when you think from the   standpoint of political you have more   than men let's say men are 50% women of   50% you're much more than 50% added   together and I actually believe that's   one of the reasons why you haven't seen   Christianity and other religions within   the United States going like a rocket   ship   like our polls have been going in the   last four weeks a rocket ship right I   really believe that because you're great   people the people that you rely on on   Sunday and all during the week they've   been stopped from talking and speaking   by a law and we're gonna get rid of that   loads gonna get rid of we're gonna get   rid of it so fast I'm so proud to say   honestly I don't want to take credit but   you had 50 people in that first meeting   and many more than a second I'm so proud   I was just telling this to Tony to say   that was my idea I figure it's the only   way I'm getting to heaven so this is   gonna be very good the only way   so we're gonna get rid of it and we're   gonna let your great people speak and   you're gonna see something happen that's   gonna be very very good okay   so important I hope which means you have   to get out and vote   on November 8th you cannot you didn't   vote four years ago you didn't vote you   didn't well you did a few of you do   believe me I know I look at the stats   you didn't vote but this time you really   have and this is your last chance this   is it I mean we'll never have this   opportunity again so I hope you can get   every one of your friends and just get   up your family and your friends and get   out and vote okay November 8th   [Applause]   and if you do we're gonna win by a lot   that's not gonna even be a closed   selection and if you don't it could be a   very unhappy November 8th we're also   going to repeal and replace disastrous   Obamacare   [Applause]   which gives the government control over   the lives of everyday citizens and the   numbers are horrendous your premiums are   going up by 50 60 70 % the deductible is   so high you never get to use it unless   you are going to leave a very long and   very complex bad period very very long   it is a disaster it's a disaster and   everybody knows it and it's gonna die of   its own weight anyway but we're gonna   get rid of it and we're gonna replace it   with some great great alternatives much   better healthcare at a much lower price   Hillary Clinton wants to have completely   government-run health care which would   be a disaster for the liberties and   freedoms of all America that's what she   wants that's what she's aiming at that's   what Obama wanted he didn't quite get   there but he got this and you see how   bad this has been one of the biggest   issues in this race is going to be the   issue of school choice and I can't   possibly emphasize this enough millions   of poor and disadvantaged students are   trapped in failing schools this   education crisis afflicts all   communities but none more so than the   african-american community none the   Democratic Party has run the inner   cities of America for 50 60 70 years   some cases over a hundred years over a   hundred years their policies and their   politics and in particular the politics   of people like Hillary Clinton have   reduced only poverty joblessness and   rising crime when she was running for   the Senate   in New York State she said she was going   to produce jobs jobs jobs in upstate New   York it's a disaster   she could have produced jobs big thing   jobs we're gonna bring back jobs been a   catastrophe we've lost tens of thousands   of jobs she never did a thing it was all   talk   no action just like what she's doing   right now is all talk no action she'll   talk and talk and nothing will happen   only bad will happen but you just have   to ask the people in upstate New York   she won because of them and she produced   absolutely nothing jobs left its today   one of the worst one of the most   depressing places in this country so   just remember that when you hear her   talking about jobs   I know jobs she doesn't know jobs that I   can tell you I have outlined a new civil   rights agenda for our time the right to   a safe community a great education and a   secure job and I say to African American   parents I say to Hispanic American   parents and I say it with great respect   our inner cities are a disaster   crime no jobs education is the worst in   many cases almost worldwide bad and in   many cases actually worldwide bad I say   with great respect what do you have to   lose it can't get any worse it can't get   any worse you choose Donald Trump I'm   gonna fix the problem you're gonna have   safety you're gonna have good education   we're gonna get jobs cuz we're gonna   bring our jobs back Mexico's taking our   job so many other places they're taking   our jobs where China is doing to us is   horrible we're gonna be jobs what do you   have to lose I'm gonna fix it I'm gonna   fix it   [Applause]   school choice is at the center of the   civil rights agenda and my goal is to   provide every single inner-city child in   America that is trapped at a failing   government school the freedom to attend   the school of their choice competition   the schools will get better and better   and better that means a private school a   religious school a charter school or a   magnet school school choice also means   that parents can home school their   children 100 percent   Hillary Clinton opposes school choice   because she is controlled totally   totally like a puppet by special   interests her policies will force   millions of african-american and   Hispanic children to remain stuck in   failed government schools leading to   higher unemployment and more poverty the   poverty levels in this country   nobody will believe nobody will believe   my plan will break the government   monopoly and make schools compete to   provide the best services for our   children including every African   American and Hispanic child in this   country every single one of them   [Applause]   this proposal begins with a twenty   billion dollar block grant from the   federal government for states to pursue   school choice programs however that's   good right   however because 90% of education   spending is at the state level I will   campaign to get the states to reallocate   another hundred and ten billion dollars   of their education budgets to school   choice programs if we do this that would   mean $12,000 in school choice funds for   every disadvantaged student in America   what a difference this is going to make   the money will follow the student to the   public private or religious school that   is best for them and their family in so   many ways you're going to have a choice   my administration will partner with the   leadership of any inner city anybody   anybody in the inner cities of America   willing to run a pilot program and there   will be a lot of them to provide school   choice to every child in that community   it Baltimore for instance that would   mean more than $15,000 in funds   available per student as you president I   will be the biggest cheerleader for   school choice you've ever seen   [Applause]   this means a lot to me because I know it   can turn things around again the   education can't get worse   common core we're gonna end it to bring   an education local I will fight for   every child in this country who deserves   better futures the african-american   community has heard my message that I am   going to make the inner city safe again   and I'm going to bring back jobs and I'm   gonna bring back the great education   don't be surprised remember this   November 8th don't be surprised because   we have been given a lot of support over   the last three or four weeks if on   November 8th   I get more african-american and Hispanic   votes than anyone thought possible   about a month ago you see what's going   on the starting people are starting to   hear about this and they're saying wow   wow they're liking it and again can't   get any worse it's gonna get a lot   better but only if I do it they can't do   it the Democrats they have what they've   done is incredible and Hillary Clinton   will be absolutely more of the same   rigid it'll never change remember a   hundred years 70 years 50 it's not going   to change not going to happen now let's   talk about another issue that will   define the future of this country for   generations to come   the United States Supreme Court   earlier this year we lost the great   Justice Antonin Scalia the next   president will not only have to fill   this seat but as many as four others it   could even be II I mean we could end up   with a total of five judges by one   president would be record-setting   probably be three could be four   could even be five and you picked the   wrong people you have a country that is   no longer your country it will be a   disaster one of the most important   issues frankly other than maybe defense   because we're going to build up our   military it's so depleted let's take   care of our vets we're gonna protect   your Second Amendment so many things but   one of the most important some people   think it's actually the most important   is the filling of the seats United   States Supreme Court you see what's   happening right now essentially it's   four and four and you see what how bad   it is we're going to pick great judges   I've already put a list of eleven   Federalist Society highly recommended   got uniform great reviews on these   eleven people and we are going to put   truly great people maybe we use judge   Scalia as the ultimate example of what   we're looking for okay   [Applause]   this will determine whether or not we   remain a constitutional republic frankly   that's what's gonna happen I have   pledged to appoint judges who uphold the   Constitution to protect your religious   liberty and apply the law as written we   reject judges who rewrite the   Constitution to impose their own   personal views on 300 million plus   Americans are going to have that I've   made public a list of judges as I said   that will guide my selection process   hillary clinton has refused to provide   such a list and we brought it up let's   see you list you ever saw the list you   would walk out of here not feeling very   well   because she knows the extremest judges   she would pick would be rejected by the   overwhelming majority of the American   public they'd be rejected Clinton's   judicial picks would allow her to   completely take over American health   care the American economy and Americans   religious liberty not to mention your   second Amendment which is on very thin   ice right now as you know because of the   fact that we're four or four if they   even pick one judge is wrong you can   probably as you know it you can kiss the   second amendment goodbye and we don't   want to see that another issue in this   race of great importance to everyone in   this room is the issue of course of   national security just today it was   announced that North Korea performed its   fifth nuclear test its fourth since   Hillary Clinton became Secretary of   State it's just one more massive failure   from a failed Secretary of State   failed at everything her policies have   also put Iran onto a path of nuclear   weapons and I have to say made them   overnight an absolute power they were   dying three years ago the sanctions were   choking them they would have fallen but   Obama didn't support people that would   have taken over and I think in this case   probably would have taken over the right   way had no support but look at what's   happened to Iran in such a short period   of time but remember the ransom payments   remember was four hundred million   dollars two weeks ago but then they made   a mistake this is cash remember they   said they paid cash because they   couldn't open a bank account there was   no way of sending it into a check in a   camera well lies just like Obama care   was a big lie remember you can use your   plan you can use you doctors 27 times   right 27 times use your doctors use your   plan turned out to be alive it's all a   lie it's all a big lie it's a rigged   system and it's a lie   and I'll tell you what I'll tell you   what the four hundred million for those   that have been reading the papers over   the last two days turned out to be 1.7   billion in cash cash and I actually said   they said all that money's gonna be used   for terror I said no they don't need a   fighter they've got 150 billion that's   in addition to the hundred and fifty   billion those that were given back as if   they don't need it this is going into   their Swiss accounts and going into   their accounts they're not going to use   it for terror they have plenty of money   for terror   think of it 1.7 billion in cash massive   big vats of cash you saw cartons never   saw anything like it I've seen a lot of   cash   hey never saw anything like this 1.7   billion can you imagine these guys   planes get they stop   remember they wouldn't get back to   hostages they waited there for hours and   hours and Obama kept saying no no no   this has nothing to do even the hostages   said they kept us waiting for a certain   plane to come in not to take them back   because they were waiting for something   it was this just another lie but can you   imagine these people sitting there and   they see 1.7 billion in cash yeah yeah   they think we're stupid they think we're   stupid they won't be thinking it for   long   [Applause]   first time   at the same time Isis is hunting down   and exterminating what it calls the   nation of the cross   Isis is carrying out a genocide against   Christians in the Middle East we cannot   let this evil continue can't let Isis   must be destroyed kaftan have no choice   to defeat Isis we must use military   warfare but also cyber warfare financial   warfare and ideological warfare it's a   whole different ballgame today that it   was 50 years ago and 200 years ago   different world we must also establish a   bipartisan goal in the United States and   an international goal with our allies of   defeating radical Islamic terrorism   [Applause]   words that a president won't use and   words that Hillary Clinton won't use   just like we won the Cold War by   identifying our enemy and building a   consensus to guide a long-term strategy   so too must we do the same with Islamic   terrorism by the way President Obama has   allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our   country at unbelievable rates and   Hillary Clinton wants to allow five   hundred and fifty percent more but it's   almost impossible to get a Christian in   from Syria they take others but they   don't take Christians very rare very   rare so I said that we need to make safe   zones in the region we want to take care   of people but we absolutely cannot allow   this potential tremendous threat to   continue and we have to stop this this   is going to be potentially a catastrophe   for our country it's it's from within   this could be the all-time great Trojan   horse this could be it you ever notice   on the you look at the migration trail   and you see people with cell phones cell   phones and some of the cell phones have   the ISIS flag but they don't know and   some of them have things far worse than   that scenes far worse than that so it   was the failed policies you have to   remember of Hillary Clinton and Obama   that Unleashed Isis in the first place   if they did the right thing you wouldn't   be talking about Isis right now now she   wants to get rid of all where did it get   rid of him you know she tells him   already   there will be no boots on the ground now   even if you don't want boots you don't   want to say it don't say it now they're   saying oh I hope she wins oh boy would   they dream of having her as   rather than can your man they dream   about it every night having Hillary   Clinton but even if you believe and I   can understand that no boots only one I   can you don't say it let them think   they're gonna go through hell don't say   it can you imagine the great General   Douglas MacArthur can you imagine the   great General George Patton or one of   our great generals that we have today   general Flynn was here someplace   I love general Flynn but can you imagine   these people saying I mean they're   basically giving out the strategy there   will be no boots on the ground if you   don't want that I fully understand don't   say it don't say it   can you imagine regards our saying we're   gonna fight the enemy and we're gonna   move our troops in about a month   we're gonna hit from behind we're gonna   and everything they say turns out to be   true you know I hate to say this cuz we   have a lot of Evangelicals in this room   committee we shouldn't be so honest when   it comes to military strategy does that   mix I hope I didn't lose your vote for   saying that   just look at what her policies have left   us with in Iraq Syria and Libya the   problem is Hillary Clinton is   trigger-happy she really is she's   trigger-happy and yet she says no boots   which is sort of interest probably will   be boots you know probably will turn out   to be another disaster her tenure has   brought us only war and destruction and   death she's just too quick to intervene   invade or to push for regime change with   people we don't even know who they are   and they take over and they're far worse   this creates the power vacuums that are   filled by terrorists and groups like   Isis my administration on the other hand   will work with any country that is   willing to partner with us to defeat   Isis and halt radical Islamic terrorism   and by the way that includes Russia if   they want to join us or knocking out   Isis that is just fine as far as I'm   concerned   [Applause]   it's a very imperfect world and you   can't always choose your friends life   but you can never fail to recognize your   enemies we have some real enemies   unfortunately for our country our   enemies probably hacked into Hillary   Clinton's emails these are the same   emails she destroyed after receiving a   federal subpoena what's that   using software in order to bleach the   email so you can never ever see them   she even mysteriously lost 13 different   phones before the FBI got them and many   were destroyed with a hammer did anybody   ever hit a hammer what you know up maybe   two or three people but they were just   released from prison those two people   can you believe this destroyed them with   a hammer the old-fashioned way I guess   the other night in the   commander-in-chief forum did anybody see   that how did I do   [Applause]   well we have a big debate coming up who   knows what's gonna happen there but I   will say every poll has me winning big   league the commander in chief   we had the polls came out after that   event and we won big league now we have   a debate coming up I don't imagine any   of you that'll be watching the debate I   won't I promise   Hillary Clinton answered questions on   her emails horribly that's why she lost   that's why she did so poorly she was   terrible she was honestly I shouldn't be   saying this she was terrible   she keeps talking about the emails every   time she talks about her she talks about   him differently it seems each week true   just like a different answer but there   can be no answer when she deletes 33,000   emails bleaches them so they can never   be recovered and unheard of practice   hammers them into total silence you know   what's happening you know what's   happening I always say getting away with   that will be the single greatest   accomplishment of her career truth   true   [Applause]   so our answers were bad they were bad   and a lot of people said they were so   totally dishonest and you know she was   blaming Matt Lauer I thought Matt Lauer   did a very good job   I mean his questions to me were very   tough but the gentleman who stood up and   said honestly you should be in prison   for what you did to me that was the   tough one hours too tough anyway that   was a tough question it was sort of a   question in the form of a statement but   Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our   president for many reasons   [Applause]   through   [Applause]   she's unfit for many reasons the biggest   of which is her judgment it's just so   bad it's time to restore honesty and   integrity to our government have to do   it and one more issue final issue I want   to discuss today is the economy and   helping those in need there is no more   charitable group in this country than   Christians and all of us true and all of   us here today are determined to lift   suffering Americans out of poverty that   are do it with a lot of other people   that help as your president I will   pursue a complete reform of our economy   to bring back millions of new jobs into   our country millions of new jobs we've   lost our jobs like we're a bunch of   babies they've gone to other countries   they've gone to Mexico they've gone to   many other countries China is taking   massive advantage of us it's also easy   believe me it's all so easy that   includes we will be doing massive tax   cuts for working families and for   businesses it includes very importantly   the elimination of all needless   job-killing regulations   [Applause]   it includes lifting the restrictions on   American energy which is under siege   I will also renegotiate NAFTA and if   they don't want to renegotiate it so it   becomes a two-way highway not just a   one-way highway out of the United States   for our companies and our jobs we will   terminate NAFTA believe me we'll stand   up to China and we're gonna fight for   every last job it's gonna be America   first and it's gonna be the American   worker first crucially I will also fight   for the American family and American   Family Values the family must be at the   center of any anti-poverty agenda has to   be   [Applause]   thank you our country just lost one of   the great champions for the American   family   Phyllis chef Lee great woman really   great woman   we send our thoughts and prayers to her   loved ones I will be going to her   funeral tomorrow in st. Louis   Phyllis fought very hard to the very end   for a free and prosperous America she   understood that to be truly United as a   country we can't simply turn to   government or to politicians the bedrock   of our unity is the realization that we   are all brothers and sisters created by   the same God   Phyllis understood that Phyllis   understand me and by the way Phyllis   endorsed me a long time ago when it   wasn't necessarily something that was so   easy to do and she was incredible she   was so brave she endorsed me and that   was not the thing to do at the time   people said Trump she said he's going to   win you don't understand he knows how to   win he's going to win   they said Phyllis not gonna be trouble   and we went boom boom boom but I will   tell you Phyllis endorsed me at a time   when it wasn't necessarily the thing to   do even the popular thing to do and I   will never forget that that had a huge   impact he was a great great powerful   woman with a tremendous heart and I look   forward to being with her family   tomorrow because he really celebrates a   celebration she was 92 years old   we're all equal and we all come from the   same creator if we remember that simple   fact then our future is truly limitless   there is nothing we as Americans can't   do there's a biblical verse that I've   often read and I want to repeat it again   because I think it is so important to   what we're trying to achieve right now   for our country   it's from first John chapter 4 no one   has ever seen God but if we love one   another God lives in US and his love is   made complete in us so true   imagine what our country could   accomplish if we started working   together as one people under one God   saluting one flag   [Applause]   it's time to stop quibbling over the   smallest words and time to start   dreaming about the great adventures that   lie ahead for our country this is my   promise to all of you starting in 2017   we will be one American nation it's time   to break our ties with the bitter   failures of the past and to embrace a   new American future have to do it   together we will make America believe   again we will make America united again   and we will make America great again   thank you very much and God bless you   thank you   [Applause]   [Music]   you

  same battle that founded our country the   same battle that James Madison   reaffirmed in the Bill of Rights and   here we are today how many of you been   to the World War Two memorial in   Washington DC   I think if you get out of it what you're   willing to put into it right and you go   walk around and you see all those great   heroes like Nimitz and Eisenhower and   all those heroes from that time and then   you go up to that wall with the four   thousand golden stars and you start to   figure it out that for every one of   those stars a hundred little guys didn't   come home to mom and dad and in front of   those golden stars on the black granite   it says here we mark the price of   freedom Donald Trump will fight for our   freedom Donald Trump   Donald Trump will secure our southern   border Donald Trump will fight for a   strong national defense he will fight   for conservative Supreme Court justices   and he will fight to make America great   again   [Applause]   look at look at the choice we have   obviously we know and we love that   Donald Trump is not politically correct   but look at Hillary Clinton while he's   not politically correct she lies with   incredible skill and grace that only a   lifetime politician can do and she lies   over and over and over again   she lied when she said she turned over   her emails   she lied when she said nothing was   confidential she lied about the Clinton   Foundation and she spent time lining her   pockets instead of the people that   needed the help here's the difference   how about this I don't we beat her in   November together right   Donald Trump and Mike Pence will tell   the truth Donald Trump and Mike Pence   will protect the Second Amendment he   will protect vets in the military he   will protect the sovereignty of the   United States who wants four more years   of the Barako style Barack Obama style   government   does anyone hear what Hilary Clinton   back in the White House who here wants   to save America and elect Donald Trump   president well we have a little surprise   just before Donald Trump comes out and   you'd probably didn't know that this was   going to happen but we have not just the   great hero former mayor of New York City   but America's mayor please welcome   [Music]   [Music]   thank you   thank you   well when I'm here when I'm here in   Miami I see more people from New York   than I see in New York that's kind of it   I think Yogi Berra taught me that this   is a very very excited crowd now I think   I know why   because you're sensing victory aren't   you   you see these polls turning around and   you see that in these polls turn all   those American people that Hillary   Clinton put in the in the basket right   in the basket I like being in that   basket I mean we're the Forgotten people   we're the people they don't care about   where the outsiders they are the ones   who have all the power in Washington and   what have they done with it what have   they done with that power I'll tell you   what the Clintons have done with that   power they've made hundreds of millions   of dollars with it   Dow's with it   she's had her chance she's had a chance   as a senator from New York in which he   accomplished nothing except break her   promise to deliver jobs to upstate New   York which he utterly failed at doing   and she had her chance at Secretary of   State and everything in the world was   worse after she was Secretary of State   than before she couldn't have failed at   more things than any Secretary of State   in my life distant in the Middle East   look at Egypt perfectly stable and   secure they had to go through a   revolution with the Muslim Brotherhood   taking over and then now luckily they   have a president Sisi who can stabilize   it but they had to go through many   deaths and awful lot of turmoil and   creates her well an entire region she   advised in removing Qadhafi from Libya   removing Qaddafi Qaddafi had given up   his weapons of mass destruction Qadhafi   basically was nude in the 1980s by   Ronald Reagan Gaddafi wasn't a threat to   anyone outside of his own country and   now the people inside his own country   who have taken over are killing a lot   more people than he was killing that's   all due to Hillary Clinton and then she   was on television not during the forum   with mr. Trump a couple of days ago and   she was asked about Libya and she said   nobody no Americans died in Libya   I guess she forgot about our ambassador   I guess she forgot about his hey I guess   she forgot about the - two very very   brave men who tried to come to their aid   and tried to save them against orders I   guess she's never seen the movie 13   hours which by the way you should go see   she is directly responsible for what   happened   okay okay   she is she is directly responsible for   the failure to secure that mission after   600 requests none of which reached her   desk now none of the decisions on the   emails reach the desk   none of the decisions on Benghazi   reached her desk she doesn't remember   her entrance briefing on how to handle   secured information I remember mine I   remember I remember mine in 1981 I   remember my exit briefing well not when   I left the Justice Department how come I   can remember that she can what you know   why because she's not telling the truth   that's why because she never tells the   truth the other day she had pneumonia   she went up to a little girl and kissed   her   not only that as she walked out of her   daughter's apartment and this is perfect   perfect Hillary Clinton as she walked   out of her daughter's apartment knowing   that three days earlier she had been   diagnosed with pneumonia she was asked   by a person how do you feel she said I   feel wonderful you know what you know   what I learned in Catholic school that's   called a lie   she didn't know that see parentheses on   a government document means confidential   because she thought they were in   alphabetical order no one no one   bothered to ask Oh which will give you   an idea of how incompetent the FBI   investigation was and the Justice   Department investigation if I were   conducting that investigation you know   what my next question would be did you   have to see an A or a B or a D or an F   and maybe when you didn't see the a B D   and F you figure out that C meant on a   sensitive government document   confidential information   now if you really didn't know it because   she couldn't remember her entrance   briefing then she's too dumb to be   President   [Applause]   she must really think we're idiots right   she must think we're all yeah well   actually she told us she thinks her   idiots right she must really think was   stupid to accept this now all during the   time that Hillary Clinton has been   resting in July I think she made three   appearances of four in August I'm sorry   all the time she's been resting donald   trump has been campaigning day in and   day out sometimes 12 14 hours again and   he hasn't it been campaign instead of   doing what she's doing which is putting   on these vicious nasty personal attacks   on donald trump which is what the   Clintons do all the time   vicious nasty horrible negative   campaigning donald trump has been laying   out position after position lowering   taxes increasing the size of our   military renegotiating NAFTA securing   our border childcare and i know for sure   that a president Trump would never have   made the agreement with Cuba that   President Obama did   just like he wouldn't have given up the   nuclear defense of the Czech Republic   and Poland and got nothing in return   Hillary Clinton by the way made that   stupid deal Donald Trump will make deals   in the best interest of United States of   America and when the deals aren't he   will be able like Ronald Reagan he'll be   able to walk out and you know what   happens when you walk out and you   represent a powerful America with an   enhanced military like Ewan's they're   going to come back to the table on your   terms   Glenn doesn't understand this and Obama   doesn't understand it who's going to be   our next president are we going to win   Florida are we going to win big yeah   thank you   today   [Music]   you   [Music]   [Music]   you   [Music]

by the way little lady they   presented with me with something that I   figured I put on is that okay to put it   on they gave me that and I love it I   think it's great you're cops and   soldiers thank you all of you two   [Applause]   carpenters and welders accountants and   lawyers young and old rich and poor   black white and Hispanic but above all   we are together and we are Americans   we got to pull our country together just   today I was honored to get the   endorsement of recipients of the Medal   of Honor brave people and many many of   our most amazing military leaders   generals Admirals amazing people real   fighters they really know what they're   doing we now have the endorsements of   more than 160 top generals and admirals   I didn't know we had that many well we   also have the support of 16,500 Border   Patrol officers the first time in the   history of the Border Patrol that   they've endorsed any presidential   candidate as well as law enforcement   officers police all across the country   in fact I'm very excited to announce   tonight that we just received a few   minutes ago the endorsement of the   largest police union in the country the   Fraternal Order of Police number one by   far pretty good pretty good and we have   the support of millions of patriotic   moms and dads who couldn't work every   day and make our country run   while my opponent slanders you as   deplorable and irredeemable where that   second word is stuff you don't hear that   as much but that means you're never   going to come back folks and I know   you're going to come back we're going to   come back so strong we're going to be so   strong stronger than ever before   irredeemable they don't talk about that   one but that was to me pretty bad I   called you hard-working American   patriots who love your family and really   really really love your country love   your country   clintons entire campaign rests on using   a single tactic and it's not working   very well   she spent hundreds of millions of   dollars on phony campaign ads and we're   actually I think probably leading based   on everything we're saved and we've   spent practically nothing I'm proud of   that and you know what we're doing very   well you know in the old days if you   spent less and you had far fewer people   and you were leading you got credit   today they say well she's spending much   more money yet but she's doing poorly   very clearly but what they do is they   spear opponents and you look at her   history and they question policies and   they talk all the time about racist   races the only word they know they used   it on Romney they used it on everybody   they use it when they're in trouble they   always pull out the racist word and they   are in very big trouble I have to tell   you   [Applause]   and for the most part we haven't even   started spending on money yet and we   have raised a lot of money and I'm   putting in my money and I put in a hell   of a lot of money in fact if things   don't work out even though a lot of   people are saying this was one of the   great political phenomena   they've ever seen they've never seen   they call it a phenomenon I will tell   you if it doesn't work out it will be a   tremendous waste of time energy and   money and she's angry for even   suggesting it but we're going to look   November 8th you go and vote we're   winning I'll tell you what if you vote   we'll win it there's no way they can   beat us there's no way she can beat us   because her people have no enthusiasm   whatsoever they're not going to turnout   they don't have the enthusiasm who could   possibly have enthusiasm what are you   getting you turn it out we're winning   big league and I think and they're all   saying the Trump people are going to   turnout we have a movement like they   have never ever seen in this country   and they say in terms of enthusiasm they   have never had Poland higher so I think   I have very little doubt turnout we're   going to have a tremendous November 8th   probably will say November 8th plus the   next four years and then four years   after that okay   but the racist word it's the oldest play   in the Democratic playbook and Americans   have had enough of it okay we get it we   get it   I'll tell you what I just I told you I   just left Little Haiti the love is   unbelievable it's unbelievable his no   racist there's no nothing it's love they   want solutions they want better lives   not more petty attacks from failed and   totally discredited politicians like   crooked Hillary Clinton they want their   immigration laws enforced and their   border secured   what November 8th okay probably they're   patriotic Americans of all backgrounds   who want their jobs and their families   protected they want protection   people who warn about radical Islamic   terrorism are not Islamophobes   everyone's an islamaphobe you mentioned   something you're an Islamophobe you know   they come up with words hey I went to   Ivy League school I did very well great   they have so many new words islamaphobe   we have a president and frankly Hillary   who don't use the words radical Islamic   terrorism and if you don't know what   you're fighting you're not going to   fight it very well and we've proven that   we have decent American citizens who   want to uphold our tolerant values and   keep our country safe we want to keep   our country safer people who support the   police who want crime reduced and ended   and who are not prejudiced they're   concerned and loving citizens whose   hearts break every time an innocent   child is killed violently on the streets   which is happening all over our country   yet while Hillary Clinton lives behind   gates and walls and guards and raises   millions from Henstridge you know look   what she's doing with his hedge funds   raising millions and millions I know so   many of these people give me a break the   hedge fund and the Wall Street donors   she slanders and smears with her   statements last week working people who   just want a fraction of the security   enjoyed by our politicians and certainly   enjoyed by her now you know she's very   much against the Second Amendment she   wants to destroy your second and   guns guns guns right I think what we   should do is she goes around with armed   bodyguards like you have never seen   before I think that her bodyguards   she drop all weapons they should disarm   but right I think they should disarm   immediately what do you think yes yes   yeah take their guns away she doesn't   want guns take their let's see what   happens to him take their guns away okay   it'd be very dangerous her comments   displayed the same sense of arrogance   and entitlement that led her to violate   federal law Secretary of State hide and   delete her emails destroy her iPhones   with a hammer with a hammer fifteen of   them put classified information in the   reach of our enemies lie to Congress and   sell government favors and access   through her foundation it's the same   attitude of applicants and entitlement   that explains why she has never taken   accountability for the disaster she   created in Libya Syria Iraq Iran and all   over the world everything she touched it   just didn't work out certainly it didn't   work out for our country it's the same   reason why she won't take responsibility   for her central role in unleashing Isis   all over the world   her policies have created disaster   overseas and poverty at home we see it   look we see it I drove here we see it we   see it I'm running to reverse these   values and they are incredible failures   and create a new American future and   that future begins with prosperity at   home my economic agenda can be summed up   in three words and you can like these   three words jobs jobs jobs   [Applause]   one of my highest priorities is to bring   jobs into our inner cities   african-american communities have   suffered horribly as a result of failed   Democratic leadership Democrats have run   these inner cities for a half a century   for 60 years   75 years even in some cases a hundred   years straight unabated unbroken over a   hundred years they control the mayor's   offices the school boards the city   councils and the seats in Congress and   all they have delivered is more poverty   more crime and more failing schools   sixty-five percent of african-american   children under the age of six now live   in poverty   [Music]   more than 3000 people have been shot in   the city of Chicago this year this year   think of it since January 1st 58% of   african-american youth are not working   taking a job these are the results of   the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton   and everyone knows that if she's elected   the inner cities will get nothing but   more pain and suffering and crime and   heartache   [Applause]   [Applause]   you   amazing people amazing country we have   an amazing country and honestly you see   the crime statistics your   african-american you have the inner city   problems that have been going on for   ever forever you have problems like   nobody has and you look at crime you   look at schools you look at no jobs look   at the worst education look how   dangerous you can't walk down the street   you get shot or your child gets shot and   I've been saying it now say it openly   and some people like it and some people   don't like it and I don't really care   what do you have to lose I will fix it   I'm going to fix it we're going to fix   our inner cities we're going to make   them safe we're going to bring jobs back   so to the african-american people within   the community what do you have to lose   it can't get honestly it can't get that   so nice thank you it can't get any worse   it can't get any worse it can't get any   worse   [Applause]   thank you   so nice thank you thank you very much it   can't get any worse the crime the jobs   no jobs no education worst education   more unsafe you go to Afghanistan right   we here Afghanistan I mean we have   cities that are far more dangerous than   Afghanistan inner cities   african-american people within that   community and outside of that community   are going to be voting for Donald Trump   in record numbers you are we're gonna   fix it Hillary Clinton has been in   Washington for 30 years her disastrous   record speaks for itself   and I have to tell you what she ran for   the United States Senate in New York we   have upstate New York which is a total   disaster economic disaster she said   she's gonna bring back jobs jobs jobs   she any way she gets elected we lost our   jobs it got worse she didn't do anything   she didn't do anything she went home she   went to sleep okay she didn't do it she   didn't do anything it got worse far   worse now it's a total catastrophe just   remember that when she tells you about   jobs when she tells you she's gonna fix   trade deals she wouldn't know where to   begin   she wouldn't know where to begin and   beside that to do that kind of thing to   negotiate great trade deals to rien   hanser Miller I mean look our military   is so depleted we have the greatest   people on earth they're using equipment   that's all they're flying planes that   are old you see what's happening   it's a depleted military we have to have   a strong military we have to take care   of our vets we have to take care of   but to do these things you need a lot of   energy and she does not have the energy   and in my opinion she is totally unfit   to be the President of the United States   the only people that you will deliver   for frankly are her donors and her   special interests I'm going to deliver   for you believe me the American people   we're going to deliver you're going to   be happy and those inner cities are   going to see progress like they have   probably not probably like they have   never seen you watch like they have   never seen thank you it would lower our   taxes and we're giving a massive tax   reduction and by the way Hillary Clinton   is raising your taxes substantially if   we remove destructive regulations   unleash the vast treasure of American   energy we have so much energy it's being   destroyed our economic work and   negotiate trade deals that put America   first then there is no limit to the   number of jobs we can create and the   amount of prosperity we can unleash   there is no limit pay off our debt pay   down our debt reduce taxes get rid of   regulations my first day in office I'm   going to order a review of every single   regulation issued over the last ten   years   all needless job-killing regulations   will be immediately canceled millions of   new jobs will come pouring in and we're   going to lift the restrictions on   American energy which means at least   another half a million jobs each year   they are being destroyed and we're   unable to compete with other nations   very simple and that's just the   beginning also on my first day I'm going   to ask Congress to send me a bill to   immediately repeal and replace   disastrous Obamacare it has turned out   to be a disaster   [Applause]   [Applause]   this alone will instantly save another 2   million jobs and if you look at your   premiums it's through the roof and by   the way on November 1st just before the   election on November 8th new numbers are   coming out which will show 40 50 60 %   increases they wanted to lay it till   after the election because it's election   it's it's a disaster it's a disaster and   your deductibles are so high   that unless you lead a really long slow   vicious death you're never going to be   able to use ok you see the deductibles   you're never going to be able to use it   I'm also going to completely reform our   trade deals we're going to renegotiate   NAFTA probably the worst trade deal ever   agreed to signed in the history of the   world not in the United States it's   destroyed on manufacturing in our   country it's destroyed and by the way   guess who signed it Bill Clinton   you look at all of the places Florida   included but you look at upstate New   York you look at Ohio you look at   Pennsylvania you look at all of these   different places have been destroyed   absolutely destroyed you look at New   England look what happens in New England   they've been destroyed by companies   moving out going into Mexico firing   everybody unemployment through the roof   we're going to stand up to China and   keep America out of the trans-pacific   partnership another catastrophe   [Applause]   TPP will be almost as bad as NAFTA   nothing can be as bad as NAFTA   trans-pacific partnership will be almost   as bad as NAFTA it will take your jobs   Ohio remember it's going to take your   jobs Ohio I tell you that Michigan so   many places TPP is a disaster we don't   need another massive multinational deal   by the way that nobody on our side even   reads that ties us up and binds us down   and doesn't even discuss monetary   manipulation and devaluation which is   how China and all these countries are   beating us so badly not even discussed   and they had provisions in the agreement   and they were taken out because certain   politicians didn't want to have them in   there I wonder why   another major reform is going to be   school choice and we're going to   terminate Common Core and we're bringing   our education local   [Applause]   I've outlined a plan to provide every   disadvantaged child in America the   freedom to choose the private public   magnet or religious school of his or her   choice   this will help lift millions of poor   african-american and Hispanic children   out of poverty something we are going to   do since President Obama came into   office another two million Hispanic   Americans have fallen into poverty it's   catastrophic and it's totally   unacceptable to the Hispanic community I   say we are going to protect your jobs   we're going to build up your schools and   we're going to deliver safety and   opportunity for your children you have   no safety you have little opportunity   this week I also rolled out a plan to   help our mothers and our families get   affordable quality child care for their   children child care he won't get up very   much for child care she's been talking   about that to me for two years long   before I even decided to go through this   journey and it's not easy I want to tell   you we speak in rooms like this this is   about a hundred degrees right now that's   considered a cool auditorium and the   reason is we have such big crowds like   this one look at that every single   corner unbelievable   these rooms weren't designed for this   many people and it is hot in these rooms   and we stand up here and we talk and we   do two or three and sometimes we'll be   hitting for a day do you think Hillary   Clinton can get through one yep see here   18 minute speech   bom-bom-bom see ya see ya I'm going home   now we're doing it the right way and   frankly when they spend hundreds of   millions of dollars on advertising I   don't have to because I do it the   old-fashioned way I come into your   neighborhood run a lot cheaper so that I   don't work but it's a lot cheaper   [Applause]   very true   very very true on policy after policy we   are going to provide opportunity   prosperity and security for all   Americans we're also going to stand with   the Cuban people in their fight against   communist oppression   [Applause]   we're on the we're on the right side   great people the great people the   president's one-sided deal for Cuba and   with Cuba   benefits only the Castro regime   [Applause]   people are very unhappy about it you   know was interesting when he landed the   plane recently in China right they   refused to give miss their way out of   Air Force One now that is a first in the   history of Air Force One   so he used basically the mechanics   stairs   that's the stair they dropped down to   get the mechanics up to fix the   lightbulb right when he landed the plane   in Saudi Arabia which we protect without   us they wouldn't be there for two months   he landed in Saudi Arabia   he wasn't greeted by the top officials   now what would I have done in those two   cases bomb take me back to Washington   Jim let's go   [Applause]   let's go Jim get down close those doors   we're going on with Cuba with Cuba we   land in Cuba and there's no Castro to   Google who the big leaders weren't there   to greet him and I have a lot of Cuban   friends but you would have all done the   same thing again Jim let's close those   doors we're going home right right let's   go captain we're going home we're going   into Washington maybe walk into Miami   actually that's not a bad idea   terrible at 3:00 3:00 Saudi Arabia Cuba   China Air Force one has never been   treated so badly at its long and   incredible history Air Force one used to   land and people would respect the people   inside and it'd come out and there'd be   all sorts of hoopla not anymore it's   unbelievable and these are countries   that are benefited by us greatly so we   have to make great deals before we do   anything with Cuba or anybody else right   we're going to make great does you'll be   happy you're gonna be happy I tell you   how many people are from Cuba here come   here Tommy Cupid given good you agree   with me do you agree we'll do it but   we'll do it with great deals and we'll   do it with democracy   and we'll do it the way we have to do it   okay we'll do it the right way where is   Miss Delgado does everybody know what a   great where is she she is so amazing AJ   where's agent Wow she's so she's become   a tremendous star tell you one thing   when she's representing me I wouldn't do   it anyway but I can turn off the   television I'm well protected   thank you great job thank you very much   thank you ageless but all of the   concessions that barack obama has   granted the Castro regime were done   through executive order which means the   next president can reverse them and that   I will do unless the Castro regime meets   our demands that might commence our   domains you know what the demands are   those demands will include religious and   political freedom for the Cuban people   and the freeing of political prisoners   for free of political   closeable right am i oh is that right   oh boy oh boy what energy in this room   what energy   a lot of energy   you'd be very happy my Cuban friends I   have so many friends from Cuba   incredible people so let's also talk   about a place called Venezuela okay now   who's here from Venezuela or related in   some not too many whoa whoa what's going   on not too many not too many friend or   foe I think he's from I think he's from   nice okay he's okay by the way is there   any place more fun to be than a trump   rally you tell me right   that year we have a lot of Venezuelans   around Doral the Doral section right and   it's a beautiful vibrant this is an   amazing place but they are really having   trouble over in Venezuela but Miami is   filled with hard-working incredible   Venezuelan people but it's been hurt   very badly by socialist Venezuela and   the next president of the United States   must stand in solidarity with all people   oppressed in our hemisphere and we will   stand with oppressed people and there   are many the oppressed people of   Venezuela they are yearning to be free   they are yearning for help the system is   bad but the people are great great they   are great people here in America I'll   push to expand freedom for all of our   citizens I'm going to lower your taxes   so substantially we're getting rid of   all of those regulations on business so   many small business owners here I know   I've of them one of them with small   business now his big business I'm proud   of him he's right here but we're going   to get rid of those terrible terrible   regulations he just said to me and the   thing that surprised me most we're   bringing business tax rates down from 35   percent to 15 percent and yet it will be   the greatest cut I believe in the   history of our country but I will tell   you what surprises me tremendously is   that the people that have these cuts   they're more concerned with regulation   than even a big tax decrease because   regulations are choking and killing our   businesses and stopping our businesses   from hiring people jobs   so I'm going to appoint justices of the   Supreme Court who will follow the   Constitution I'm going to rebuild our   depleted milk gonna take care of our   vets who's a vet who's a vet where my   vets wherever they bear they okay now   they're standing now there I know we had   a lot of vets here thank you fellas   thank you very much we're going to take   care of our vets we're going to save   your Second Amendment you know if you   look at some of the things the   catastrophes you look at Orlando you   look at San Bernardino you look at so   many different you look at Paris the   toughest gun laws in the world they have   it in Paris these thugs these animals   walked in and they just go bum bum bum   nobody had guns on the other side if   there were guns on the other side just a   few of them number one probably if they   knew they wouldn't have attacked and   number two even if they did attack it   would have been a whole different soy   132 flea injured still in the hospital   their lives are just destroyed and if   they had protection if they had guns on   the other side with the bullets lying   the other direction would have been a   whole different story so we're going to   protect your second Amendment I'm going   to stop illegal immigration and drugs   from coming into our country and yes we   will   a wall you'll build a wall   we will build a wall   who's going to pay for the wall 100%   100% and we're going to be renegotiating   NAFTA and our terrible trade deals we're   going to make great deals out of   horrible deals and if we can't   renegotiate the deal because the other   side is so so happy with it we're going   to terminate the deal and we'll start   all over again folks will have new deals   and there'll be much better deals and   there'll be two-way streets the traffic   it'll be coming our way it's a one-way   street out of the United States for our   jobs and our money you know I always say   we get the drugs they get the cash   that's the deal folks no good they're   building in Mexico right now in Mexico   is just one example some of the greatest   plants a friend of mine builds plants   and he tells me all the time I called   them up the other day I called them up   six months ago told me the same thing   nothing changes Ford they just announced   yesterday they're moving their small car   division the whole thing into Mexico   that's on top of spending billions and   billions of dollars and then you wonder   why I'm winning in Michigan because I've   been telling the people in Michigan I've   been telling the people in Ohio for five   years that this is happening and our   politicians don't do anything about it   and Hillary Clinton will never do   anything about it she doesn't have the   capability to do it we will rebuild our   roads and bridges tunnels highways   airports schools and hospitals American   cars will travel the roads American   planes will soar in the sky they'll soar   and American ships will patrol the seas   American steel will send new skyscrapers   right here in Miami into the clouds but   it'll be American   Skule American hands will rebuild this   nation an American energy mind from   American sources will power our energy   and we'll take care of our steel workers   and we'll take care of our miners who   have been destroyed by this   administration destroyed and Hillary   Clinton has already said she's going to   put the miners out of business   we're going to take care of our miners   amazing people American workers will be   hired to do the job we will put new   American steel into the spine of our   country I won't fight for every   neglected part of this nation and I will   fight to bring us all together as one   people imagine what our country could   accomplish if we started working   together as one people under one God   saluting one flag   [Applause]   it's time to break with the bitter   failures of the past and to embrace a   new inclusive and prosperous American   future when a prosperous anymore   we owe 20 trillion dollars we have a   president who in seven and a half years   has doubled the debt our country's in   trouble a lot of people don't know it   but our country's in trouble and we're   going to make sure that trouble never   comes let me tell you   jobs will return incomes will rise and   new factories will come rushing back to   our shores once more we will have a   government of By and For the People   [Applause]   we will make America wealthy again we   will make America safe again we will   make America strong again and we will   make America great again thank you   everybody   thank you   [Music]   [Music]   you   [Music]

that America meant it when we said we're   getting back on our feet and back on our   game because we are a nation molded by   character built for real leadership and   bred for success and we will be a nation   with Donald Trump   that's unafraid to venture where your   typical politicians don't lead where   others won't and succeed where others   can't   and in six days here in Florida we're   going to see our beautiful state move   from purple to Trump LED red   and in seven days we're going to wake up   and see a brave new leader named Donald   Trump whose sole mission is what to make   America great we've waited way too long   for this after seeing our jobs move   overseas bad trade policy and Isis out   of control and I will tell you what with   Donald Trump as our leader we will   secure our borders because as your   attorney general I am sick of seeing the   influx of cocaine and heroin coming into   our great state and country   [Applause]   and we will support our staunchest ally   Israel   [Applause]   Donald Trump cares about our police   officers and prayers to the family of   those officers who's we've just lost we   will do everything he will do everything   to protect our heroes who wear that   uniform to protect us and he will help   our veterans how many veterans do we   have out there   who've had to wait in line way too long   to receive benefits after they've held   the line for our freedom and as your   attorney general I can tell you our   constitutional rights are under siege   and with Hillary Clinton as a president   our second amendment would take second   seat two justices who think they know   better than our founding fathers   hey as Donald Trump says get out there   and vote and defeat her and yes we need   a Supreme Court who will follow the rule   of law   [Applause]   and Donald Trump will repeal and replace   Obamacare   I know Donald Trump and like he's done   across this nation and around the world   creating jobs he will get the job done   in our country let me talk about the FBI   for a minute   if any of us were under a federal   investigation if we were applying for a   job firefighters construction workers   attorneys doctors businesspeople we were   applying for a job and what do you put   on that job application that you're   under a federal investigation would an   employer hire you you know who her   employer is you the American people tell   her that   [Applause]   we I know Donald Trump his family they   are great people and he will do   everything to get our country back on   track that's why he is doing this for   all of us we understand our system is   broken Hillary Clinton is the system   Donald Trump is running to fix it   Trump for America Trump for America   Trump for America   it is now my pleasure to introduce to   you our good friend who has been working   tirelessly throughout the country with   Donald Trump the chairman of the   Republican Party   Ryan's previous   and graduate from the University of   Miami the boat go hurricanes and the   Badgers - are you all ready to win are   you all ready to win in Florida are you   ready to elect Donald Trump and Mike   Pence well I got to tell you we're in a   battle for freedom it's the same battle   that founded our country the same battle   that James Madison reaffirmed in the   Bill of Rights in the same battle that   founded our party how many people here   have been to the World War Two memorial   well I think you agree with me you get   out of it what you're willing to put   into it you walk around and you see   those great quotes from Nimitz and   Eisenhower and all those heroes from   that time and then you walk up to that   wall with the four thousand golden stars   and you start to figure it out that for   every one of those stars a hundred   little guys didn't come home to mom and   dad and then you walk up on the black   granite in gold and it says here we mark   the price of freedom we're in a battle   for freedom and Donald Trump will fight   for our freedom Donald Trump will fight   for a secure border Donald Trump will   fight for a conservative Supreme Court   Donald Trump will fight to make America   great again   and we know we know that Donald Trump is   not politically correct and look at   Hillary Clinton who lies with incredible   grace and skill   [Music]   [Applause]   and she lies over and over and over   again you know what's amazing Hillary   Clinton can remember every single   transgression every single quote for the   last 40 years it's ever come out of   Donald Trump's mouth but when she was   asked about something that actually   matters like the security in the secrets   of our country when she was interviewed   by the FBI a person that apparently can   remember everything 39 times she said I   don't recall   she lied when she said that she turned   over those emails   she lied when she said nothing was   classified   she lied when she said she turned over   every device she lied about the   foundation and she sold her position to   line her pockets here's the difference   Donald Trump and Mike Pence will tell   you the truth Donald Trump and Mike   Pence will protect the Second Amendment   Donald Trump will protect our vets and   our military and Donald Trump and Mike   pants will protect the sovereignty of   the United States who here wants four   more years of a Barack Obama style   government   who here wants four more years of   another Hillary Clinton in the White   House   who here wants to save America and elect   Donald Trump president of the United   States thank you and God bless   [Applause]   [Music]   you   and in every America   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   yeah   [Music]   yes   [Music]   [Music]   Eddie thank you thank you I love that   sign blacks for Trump I love that sign   thank you there are a lot of those signs   thank you women for Trump Hispanics for   Trump is one women and Hispanics which   are thank you very much in six days we   are going to win the great state of   Florida and we are going to win back in   the white house 100% we're on the cusp   of an incredible historic change that   transfers power from a failed political   establishment and returns that power to   our families communities and citizens to   you the system is rigged remember that   the system is rigged right now   it's rigged you're going to change it   there's some breaking news about that   subject that we're going to discuss   right now as I mentioned yesterday one   of the and you probably saw this and   maybe some of you have just read it one   of the top Department of Justice   officials involved in the email   investigation assistant attorney general   peter kassig   is a close associate of John Podesta the   two met for dinner after Clinton   testified about Benghazi and Podesta who   by the way said Hillary Clinton has   terrible instincts on WikiLeaks   described him as the man who kept him   Podesta out of jail   Kazik is also the one who helped lead   the effort to confirm Attorney General   Loretta Lynch now today in a newly   released email through WikiLeaks again   we learned that Kazik was feeding   information about the investigation into   the Clinton campaign and that quite   right and that Kazakh said quote it will   be a while before the State Department   posts the emails remember they were   waiting for the emails   Esther forwarded the emails to Clinton's   top staff and said additional chances   for mischief these are the people that   want to run our country folks   the spread of political agendas into the   Justice Department there's never been a   thing like this that has happened in our   country's history is one of the saddest   things that has happened to our country   but with your votes you can beat the   system   the rigged system and deliver justice   so show up early and vote show up early   you know the lines are incredible the   polls are all saying we're going to win   Florida don't believe it don't believe   it get out there and vote pretend we're   slightly behind you got to get out we   don't want to blow this is the one   chance we have it'll never happen again   it's not going to happen in four years   it's not going to happen it can't happen   again this is a movement like we have   never seen in this country before these   crowds the enthusiasm the love got to   get out and vote   real change begins with immediately   repealing and replacing Obamacare   and Hillary is not going to be the   answer because she wants to make it more   expensive she's doubling down it's just   been announced that the residents of   Florida started to tell you this folks   are going to experience a massive   massive double-digit premium hike now I   know what that hike is but I want you to   leave here happy I want you to be happy   people I want you to think about the   future after we take back the White   House so I'm not going to tell you what   your hike is but let me just say it's   going to be very substantial and   Obamacare doesn't work on top of   everything else as an example in the   great state of Arizona to just left   premiums are going up more than 116   percent out of control over 90% of the   counties in Florida are losing Obama   care insurance next year lot's of luck   in your negotiation in Minnesota where   the premium increase will be close to 60   percent the Democratic governor said the   Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable premiums are surging   companies are leaving insurers of   fleeing doctors are quitting and   deductibles are absolutely through the   roof was it supposed to be like this but   I said it was going to be like this   before it was passed because I   understand how business works   Obamacare never had a chance it's a   catastrophe   yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down   on Obamacare making it even more   expensive it's going to go up a lot   people aren't going to be able to afford   it so I'm not sure that it matters   they're just not going to be able to pay   I'm asking for your vote so we can   replace Obamacare and save health care   for every family in Florida and the   United States   real change also means restoring   honestly to our government as you know   the FBI is did you hear about this   little event the FBI reopening the   investigation that reopening the   investigation into crooked Hillary   Clinton crooked Hillary she is crooked   she is a crooked one there is no   question crooked Hillary Clinton oh the   term is really stuck everyone's calling   it has anyone seen crooked Hillary   Clinton today that's going to be a great   term for president right boy oh boy what   a mess this is the biggest scandal since   Watergate and now it's been reported   that there are FBI enquiries probing   virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner   circle and many of the things she's done   over the years it's about time   remember it's a rigged system remember   it's about time she wants to blame   everyone else for her mounting legal   troubles but she really has no one to   blame but herself Hillary is the one who   set up the illegal private email server   to shield her criminal activity the   woman screaming exactly exactly it is   exactly Hillary is the one who engaged   in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the   State Department and who ripped off the   people of Haiti the people of Haiti were   ripped off   and I met with the people of little   Haiti anybody here these are great   people great thank you   Hillary is the one who endangered   national security by sending classified   information on an insecure server   Hillary is the one who lied so many   times to Congress and the FBI Hillary is   the one who made 13 phones disappear   some with a hammer and she's the one who   destroyed 33,000 emails after receiving   a congressional subpoena she also   accepted debate questions given to her   in advance by Donna Brazile   and then use those debate questions to   cheat it's cheating the worst level   instead of reporting this breach to an   ethics committee or whoever would listen   to the bridge so she got the answers   cheating she got the questions cheating   and then she rather than reporting them   rather than saying this shouldn't be   happening she used them against Bernie   Sanders can you as you probably got him   against me to accept we won the debates   so easy I don't think it mattered we won   those two beds   did you see her at the end of the   debates folks she was exhausted you know   she did she immediately went home and   went to sleep   Hillary is not the victim and the   American people frankly are the victims   of this rigged and corrupt system in   every way but this is your chance   finally to change it November 8th now in   Florida's case earlier now just so you   understand record turnout unbelievable   numbers unbelievable we're doing great   with the african-american community   we're doing great with the Hispanic   community and the lines of four five and   six blocks long they've never seen   anything like it   and the polls have just come up we're   way up in Florida I shouldn't say that   because I want you to go vote okay ready   we're going to pretend we're down we're   down pretend right we'll pretend we're   down now we got to win we got to win big   we've got a beater got a beta we're up   in Ohio we're up in Iowa we're up in   North Carolina   I think we're doing great in   Pennsylvania from what I hear folks   you're going to be so proud you're going   to be so proud we're going to make   America great again you're going to be   so happy and you're going to be so proud   of your country again if Hillary Clinton   were to be elected it would create an   unprecedent and protracted   constitutional crisis haven't we just   been through a lot with the Clintons   right remember when he was impeached for   lying he can't practice law he doesn't   have the right to practice law didn't we   just go through this and the last thing   we need is another four years of Obama   celesta and this will be worse that   means Isis that means high taxes that   means bad health care that means no   border without a border we don't have a   country the work of government would   grind to a halt if she were ever elected   she'll be in court for her entire tenure   and she'll be convicted because look the   first time I mean frankly forget about   this time the first time she gets a   subpoena from the United States Congress   and she deletes everything there   shouldn't have been a second time but I   have respect that the FBI has given it a   second chance and this time I have no   doubt that in that 650,000 email did you   see that where they said oh we're not   worried they're duplicates how can that   be duplicates over the hundreds of   thousands more then you started off   [Applause]   so today I guess WikiLeaks it sounds   like is going to be dropping some more   and if we met tomorrow I'll tell you   about it tomorrow but one beauty that's   been caught was and this was just   recently newly released where they say   having a dump   we're having a dump of all of those   emails in another communication Bill   Clinton's chief of staff says foreign   government right this should be another   one just like swamp you know the swamp   little statement that I want to listen   this one do you remember what it is   right all the money is in right they   said all the money is in there talking   about foreign money pouring into their   pockets they said all the money is in   this is what is running for office   honestly she should be ashamed of   herself she should be ashamed of herself   my contract with the American voter   begins with a plan to restore honesty to   our government that includes a ban on   foreign lobbyists raising money for   American elections make sense I want the   entire corrupt Washington establishment   to hear and to heed the words we all   will be saying right now when we win on   November 8th we are going to Washington   DC and we are going to drain the swamp   going to drain the swamp   we're going to drain the swamp folks   we're going to drain that swamp   [Applause]   another important issue for Americans is   integrity in journalism these people are   among the most dishonest people I've   ever met   spoken to done business with these are   the most dishonest people   there has never been dishonesty there   has never been dishonesty like we've   seen in this election there has never   been anywhere near the media dishonesty   like we've seen in this election don't   worry they won't spend the cameras and   show the kind of massive crowds they   want to   [Applause]   the very talented Michael Goodwin of the   New York Post just wrote today that 2016   presidential race will mark the   low-water mark of journalism that is   worthy think of it of the first   amendment never before have so many   media organizations old and new   abandoned all pretense of fairness to   take sides and try to pick a president   it's unbelievable it's on honestly for   instance we'll have a great story we'll   give it out to the media they'll make it   look as bad as possible as bad as   possible   parenthetically   [Music]   [Applause]   so sad parenthetically and very sadly   earnings for the new york times are down   97 percent this year they just announced   so bad I feel so badly for them just   announced 97 percent are they're doing   great and then they tell you who to vote   for you know who to vote for they want   crooked Hillary this isn't about me it's   about all of you and our magnificent   movement to make America great again all   over this country and they're talking   about it all over the world at the core   of my contract is my plan to bring back   jobs right now 70 million American women   and children live in poverty were near   the brink of poverty 43 percent of   african-american school-age children   live in poverty 32 percent of Hispanic   school-age children live in poverty this   is America this is the United States   this is unacceptable as your president I   will go into the poorest communities and   work on a national plan for   revitalization we will replace decades   of failure with generations of success   Florida has lost one in four of its   manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal   signed by Bill Clinton and supported by   Hillary   and here's a number that you should   remember because it's not even a   believable number and it's correct   America has lost seventy thousand   factories since China entered the World   Trade Organization   another Bill and Hillary backed disaster   we are living through the greatest jobs   theft in the history of the world our   jobs are going to Mexico our jobs are   going to other countries China and   others are making our product we don't   make it anymore a trump administration   will stop the jobs from leaving America   and we will stop the jobs from leaving   Florida my second home you know that I'm   here all the time my second home great   place the theft of American prosperity   will end say they are stealing our   prosperity horribly stealing our   prosperity a Trump administration will   renegotiate NAFTA and will stand up to   foreign product dumping all over the   place   currency manipulation by China and many   other countries and all of the unfair   subsidy behavior that's going on all   over the world against us we will also   immediately stop the job-killing   trans-pacific partnership a disaster and   Hillary wants it to happen she called it   the gold standard than she rejected it   but she's going to approve it then she   lied during the debate right she lied   she lied during the bait she said she   never called it the gold standard she   lied and she lied about the line in the   sand right   she lied as part of our plan to bring   back jobs we're going to lower taxes on   American business from 35% to 15%   we will also cancel billions and   global-warming payments to the United   Nations and use that money to support   America's vital environmental   infrastructure and natural resources   we're spending hundreds of billions of   dollars we don't even know who's doing   what with the money we're going to spend   the money here we're going to work in   our own environment that includes   repairing the Herbert Hoover dike at   Lake Okeechobee and protecting the   Florida Everglades   we will become a rich nation again but   to be a rich nation we must also be a   safe nation a terrible tragedy today has   occurred in Iowa you read you saw early   this morning two iowa police officers   outstanding outstanding people were   murdered ambushed ambushed violently   while sitting in their squad cars we   send our thoughts and prayers to the   family of the Fallen I just left Iowa   most beautiful place the treatment was   so incredible the crowds the police   officers were so incredible the job they   did now two of them are dead an attack   on our police is an attack on all of us   law enforcement is the line separating   civilization from total chaos you have   to remember that according to the   National Law Enforcement Officers   Memorial Fund firearm related police   this are up 48% this year the highest   they've ever been and there have been 14   ambush style attacks this year alone   never had anything like this and what it   is is a lack of respect for our nation   it's a lack of respect for a leadership   to all the great men and women of law   enforcement I want you to know we're   with you we support you and we will   stand by you we will restore law order   and justice in America justice thank you   thank you so good luck to the people of   Iowa we will also work with our federal   and local law enforcement to keep   America safe from terrorism Hillary   Clinton wants a five hundred and fifty   percent increase in Syrian refugees   pouring into our country her plan would   mean generations of terrorism and   extremism spreading in your schools and   all throughout your communities when I'm   president we will suspend the Syrian   refugee program and we will keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of your   community   [Applause]   now we all have heart and we're going to   build safe zones and we're going to have   some of the Gulf states that have   nothing but money they'll put up the   money will lead it will build safe zones   but we have enough problems in our   country she wants to increase the   thousands and thousands and a pouring in   right now she wants to increase that   number by five hundred and fifty percent   and then you wonder why Podesta says she   has bad instincts and you wonder why   Bernie Sanders says he's got bad   judgment they're right she's got bad   judgment personally I think she's a very   unstable person if you want to really   know the truth and we're going to repeal   and replace Obamacare but you want to   know something honestly I think for   herself she's got much bigger problems   right now than Obamacare she got bigger   problems let's see what's on all those   emails that they just found see what's   on those emails   [Applause]   thank you it's too bad those cameras   aren't turning around to see this   incredible group of people with   thousands more outside isn't it to bet   they don't do it but you know if Hillary   speaks and there's 30 people in a line   they say oh the crowd is massive she   never had a crowd like this in her life   President Obama shouldn't be campaigning   for any longer it's really a conflict   right he ought to be working on jobs on   the border on building up our military   instead of campaigning for crooked   Hillary Clinton it's what he ought to be   doing   [Applause]   he's in North Carolina but we're going   to North Carolina right after this oh   but we have two more today in Florida   and we have massive crowds there's   something happening they're not   reporting it Katie and not reporting it   Katie   but there's something happening Katie   there's something happening Katie a   trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and yes we will build the war   [Applause]   thank you   we've received the first-ever   endorsement from our ice and Border   Patrol officers first time they've ever   endorsed a presidential candidate they   tell us the border crisis taking place   right now is the worst it's ever been   now in all fairness people probably   figure that I'm going to win so they're   racing across the border I don't know   I'm sorry to do this to you folks   Hillary has pledged totally open borders   meaning you don't have a country anymore   and she strongly supports sanctuary   cities like in San Francisco where Kate   right where Kate Steinle was killed by a   5-time deported illegal immigrants   [Music]   the immigration officers warned that   Hillary's plan is the most radical   immigration proposal in US history and   that'll lead to the loss of thousands of   lives and I believe that as Secretary of   State Hillary Clinton allowed thousands   of the most dangerous and violent   criminal aliens to go free because their   countries would not take them back   countless innocent Americans have been   killed by illegal immigrants last year   as an example   seventeen-year-old starlet pits her   boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to   death in their Lehigh Acres home by an   illegal immigrant the killer had been   convicted of assaulting a police officer   and was wanted for double murder and   robbery and the people that knew him   were begging that he be incarcerated   they were begging he was released from   custody pending his court appearance   enabling him to commit murder a trump   administration will stop illegal   immigration deport all criminal aliens   and save American lives   [Applause]   [Applause]   and I want to thank by the way I see all   these signs Cubans for Trump Cubans love   Cubans so they gave me last week the Bay   of Pigs Association right you know they   gave me their award last week and it was   a great honor and we're going to fight   very hard for the Cubans that we're   going to fight very very hard for the   Hispanics because they have not been   properly taken care of what's happened   with a Hispanic population in our   country is not right what's happened   with the inner cities of our country the   african-american community the Hispanic   community is very very unfair thank you   thank you   we're going to take care of it the crime   is horrible the education is terrible   and you can't get a job we're going to   fix the inner cities we're going to fix   the inner cities thank you fellas that's   so good   blacks for Trump that's so nice we will   also repeal the Obama Clinton defense   sequester and rebuild our badly depleted   military that includes total support for   homestead Air Reserve Base a trump   administration will stand in solidarity   with the suffering people of Cuba and   Venezuela all surrounding Doral all   surrounding Doral against the oppression   of the castle and Maduro regimes you   know what I'm talking about   we will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban   deal made by executive order if we do   not get the deal we want and the deal   that people living in Cuba and here   deserve   including protecting religious and   political freedom   all right I'm honored to have the   endorsement of over 200 top Admirals and   Generals and 22 Medal of Honor   recipients you know it's really called   peace through strength peace through   strength that's what we're going to have   we hopefully have to get rid of Isis   we're going to get rid of Isis don't   worry we're getting rid of Isis but we   have to get to rebuild our country we've   spent six trillion dollars in the Middle   East six trillion and it's in far worse   shape by a factor of ten from when we   started six trillion we lost lives the   most incredible great people our new   foreign policy will put America first   Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and   Syria and Libya and she empowered Iran   remembers a bad judgment and she   unleashed Isis came right out of the   vacuum now she wants to start a shooting   war in Syria in conflict with   nuclear-armed Russia   frankly it could lead to World War three   and she has no sense he's got no   instinct Podesta said it Hillary and our   failed Washington establishment they've   spent that six trillion dollars I mean   I'd love to have that money back but I'd   much rather have all those lives back   rather have all those lives   love to have those lives back but the   Middle East is in bad shape folks and   it's getting worse it's only getting   worse they've dragged us into Foreign   Wars that have made us less safe they've   left our borders wide open at home and   they've shipped our jobs and wealth to   other countries and these are foreign   wars that we don't win we don't win we   don't win anymore we don't win with   trade we don't win with Wars we don't   win anymore we're going to start winning   again you watch we're gonna sell to all   Americans I say it's time for new   leadership just think about what can be   accomplished in the first 100 days of a   trump administration we are going to   have the biggest tax cut since Ronald   Reagan and she is going to raise your   taxes very substantially I think you   know that   we will eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation cancel every   illegal Obama executive order rebuild   our military and take care of our great   veterans provide school choice and put   an end to common core we're bringing our   education local support the men and   women of law enforcement   we're going to save our Second Amendment   which is underseas and appoint justices   to the United States Supreme Court will   uphold and defend the Constitution of   the United States Clinton wants us to   think small wants us to believe things   can't change and wants our lives to   revolved around Washington sees I wonder   if she's going to be there much longer   what do you think I don't think so I   don't know I'm not sure she's going to   be there but she wants she wants our   lives to revolve around Washington DC   I'm asking you to dream big to push for   bold change and to believe in a movement   powered by the people and by their love   for this great country   I'm tired of politicians telling   Americans to defer their dreams to   another day when they really mean   another decade America is tired of   waiting the moment is now all we have to   do is stop believing in our failed   politicians and start believing in each   other and in our country there is no   challenge too great no dream outside of   our reach don't let anyone tell you it   can't be done the future lies with the   dreamers not the cynics not the critics   certainly not the media light   hilary has been there for 30 years and   she has accomplished nothing she's just   made things worse look at her record   Steve's the candidate of yesterday we   are the mute right is that right we are   the movement of the future our movement   represents all Americans from all   backgrounds and all walks of life we are   asking for the votes of Republicans and   Democrats and independents and   first-time voters and believe me there   are a lot of first-time voters that are   standing on line right now we're asking   for the vote of every American who   believes truth and justice not money and   power should rule the day and I   understand the other side very well I've   been there for a long time   but I love our country and I understand   what has to be done we are going in the   wrong direction and if we keep going in   this direction we won't have a country   any longer we're fighting for every   citizen who believes that government   should serve the people not the donors   and not the special interest   we're fighting to unlock the potential   of every American community and every   American family who hope and pray and   yearn for a better future with your vote   we are just think of it six days away   this started on June 16th of last year   it's a long time seems like a long time   ago but we're 6 days

iLcP0inAS5w~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161013~Full Speech: Donald Trump Rally in West Palm Beach, Florida (10/13/2016) Trump Live Florida Speech~39806.0~4.26114654541~896.0~203.0~   I   [Music]   water through thank you thank you very   much   thank you folks   [Applause]   thank you folks it's great to be right   here in Florida which we love in 26 days   we are going to win this great grape   safe and we are going to win the White   House   our movement is about replacing a failed   and corrupt and when I say corrupt I'm   talking about totally corrupt political   establishment with a new government   controlled by you the American people   there is nothing the political   establishment will not do no lie that   they won't tell to hold their prestige   and power at your expense and that's   what's been happening the Washington   establishment and the financial and   media corporations that fund it exists   for only one reason to protect and   enrich itself the establishment has   trillions of dollars at stake in this   election as an example just one single   trade deal they'd like to pass involves   trillions of dollars controlled by many   countries corporations and lobbyists for   those who control the levers of power in   Washington and for the global special   interest they partner with these people   that don't have your good in mind our   campaign represents a true existential   threat like they haven't seen before   this is not simply another four-year   election this is a crossroads in the   history of our civilization that will   determine whether or not we the people   reclaim control over our government the   political establishment that is trying   to stop us is the same group responsible   for our disastrous trade deals massive   illegal immigration and economic and   foreign policies that have bled our   country dry   [Applause]   the political establishment has brought   about the destruction of our factories   and our jobs as they flee to Mexico   China and other countries all around the   world our just announced job numbers are   anemic our gross domestic product or GDP   is barely above one percent and going   down workers in the United States are   making less than they were almost 20   years ago and yet they are working   harder but so am i working harder but i   can tell you   it's a global power structure that is   responsible for the economic decisions   that have robbed our working class   stripped our country of its well and put   that money into the pockets of a handful   of large corporations and political   entities just look at what this corrupt   establishment has done to our cities   like Detroit Flint Michigan and rural   towns in Pennsylvania Ohio North   Carolina and all across our country take   a look at what's going on they've   stripped away these towns bear and   raided the wealth for themselves and   taking our jobs away out of our country   never to return unless I'm elected   president   the Clinton machine is at the center of   this power structure we've seen this   firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in   which Hillary Clinton meets in secret   with international banks to plot the   destruction of us sovereignty in order   to enrich these global financial powers   her special interest friends and her   donors   so true   [Applause]   honestly she should be locked up should   be locked   and likewise the emails show that the   Clinton machine is so closely and   irrevocably tied to the media   organizations that she that she listened   to this is given the questions and   answers in advance of her debate   performance with Bernie Sanders   Hillary Clinton is also given approval   and veto power over quotes written about   her in the New York Times they   definitely do not do that to me that I   and the emails show the reporters   collaborate and conspire directly with   the Clinton campaign on helping her win   the election all over with their control   over our government at stake with   trillions of dollars on the line the   Clinton machine is determined to achieve   the destruction of our campaign not   going to happen   which has now become a great great   movement the likes of which our country   has never seen before never ever   [Applause]   they've never seen a movement like this   in our country before yesterday in   Florida massive crowds people lined up   outside of big arenas not able to get in   never happened before it's one of the   great phenomenas one of the great   political phenomenon the most powerful   weapon deployed by the Clintons is the   corporate media the press let's be clear   on one thing the corporate media in our   country is no longer involved in   journalism they're a political special   interest no different than any lobbyist   or other financial entity with a total   political agenda and the agenda is not   for you it's for themselves   and their agenda is to elect crooked   Hillary Clinton at any cost at any price   no matter how many lives they destroy   for them it's war and for them nothing   at all is out of bounds this is a   struggle for the survival of our nation   believe me and this will be our last   chance to save it on november eighth   remember that this election will   determine whether we are a free nation   or whether we have only the illusion of   democracy but are in fact controlled by   a small handful of global special   interests rigging the system in our   system is rigged this is reality you   know it they know it I know it and   pretty much the whole world knows it the   establishment and their media enablers   will control over this nation through   means that are very well known anyone   who challenges their control is   [Applause]   [Applause]   this is well documented and the   establishment that protects them has   engaged in a massive cover-up of   widespread criminal activity at the   State Department and the Clinton   Foundation in order to keep the Clintons   in power   never in history have we seen such a   cover-up as this one that includes the   total destruction of 33,000 emails 13   iPhones some by hammer laptops missing   boxes of evidence and many many other   things people who are capable of such   crimes against our nation are capable of   anything and so now we address the   slander and libel that was just last   night thrown at me by the Clinton   machine and the New York Times and other   media outlets as part of a concerted   coordinated and vicious attack it's not   coincidence that these attacks come at   the exact same moment and all together   at the same time as WikiLeaks releases   documents exposing the massive   international corruption of the Clinton   machine including 2,000 more emails just   this morning   [Applause]   these vicious claims about me of   inappropriate conduct with women are   totally and absolutely false and the   Clintons know it and they know it very   well these flames are all fabricated   they're pure fiction and they're   outright lies these events never ever   happened and the people that said them   meekly fully understand you take a look   at these people you study these people   and you'll understand also the claims   are preposterous ludicrous and defy   truth common sense and logic we already   have substantial evidence to dispute   these laws and it will be made public in   an appropriate way and at an appropriate   time very soon these lies come from   outlets whose past stories and past lens   have already been discredited the media   outlets did not even attempt to confirm   the most basic facts because even a   simple investigation would have shown   that these were nothing more than false   smears   [Applause]   six months ago the failing New York   Times wrote a massive story attacking me   and the central witness they used said   the story was false that she was quoted   inaccurately she said that I was a great   guy she had great courage I'll be honest   with you she was an amazing person and   never made those remarks that I was a   great guy and never made the remarks and   when I read the service sort of   surprised how could she say that and she   didn't say we demanded a retraction but   they refused the printed just like they   refused the pin the comments from   another source who praised me in her   book or the words of another wonderful   woman who said really nice things about   me they put other statements that she   didn't say they misrepresented the story   was a fraud and a big embarrassment to   the new york times and it was a big   front-page story front page center color   picture a disgrace they were very   embarrassed it will be part of the   lawsuit we are preparing against them   [Applause]   now today the same two discredited   writers who should have been fired from   the New York Times for what they did   tell another totally fabricated and   false story that supposedly took place   on an aeroplane more than 30 years ago   another ridiculous tale no witnesses no   nothing then there was a writer from   People magazine who wrote a story on   Milania and myself on our first   anniversary the story was beautiful it   was beautiful it was lovely but last   night we hear that after 12 years this   took place 12 years ago this early a new   claim that I made inappropriate advances   during the interview to this writer   [Applause]   and I asked very simple question well I   wasn't it part of the story that   appeared 20 or 12 years ago why was it a   part of the story why didn't they make   it part of the story I was one of the   biggest stars on television with the   apprentice and it would have been one of   the biggest stories of the year think of   it she's doing this story on Milania   who's pregnant at the time and Donald   Trump our one year anniversary and she   said I made inappropriate advances and   by the way the area was a public area   people all over the place take a look   you take a look look at her look at her   words you tell me what you think I don't   think so I don't   but it is amazing doing a story a love   story on how great we are together and   by the way we're stronger today that we   were ever were before which is but it's   a love story it's a love story on our   one year and if I did that she would   have added that it would have been the   headline and who would have done that if   you're doing this and you're one of the   top shows on television these people are   horrible people they're horrible   horrible liars and interestingly it   happens to appear 26 days before our   very important election isn't that   amazing this invented account has   already been debunked by eyewitnesses   who there they were there the very wind   is identified by the author has said the   story is totally false by the way this   is a room that everybody can see it   Scotch last walls Tamar Lago it's got   glass walls can you believe this why   wasn't it in the story biggest story of   the year this weekend the new york times   published a full-page hit faced with   another claim from an individual who has   been totally discredited based on the   many many many emails and letters she is   sent to our office over the years   looking for work Donald is great wanting   to go to my rallies but the New York   Times and this was a full op-ed piece   refuse to use the evidence that we   presented refused to use it if they used   it if they would have looked they would   have said all there's no siree others in   the media which almost surprises me   because they're dishonest also were   presented with the story by this woman   numerous times and they got very excited   but after seeing the evidence that we   immediately give them   all of them refuse to write the story   was no story the time zone didn't want   to see it they just wrote the story and   this was a full page opposite the   editorials this is part of a concerted   effort led by the New York Times and   others now the New York Times is   fighting desperately for its relevance   and its financial survival and it   probably won't even be around in a few   years based on its financial outlook   which wouldn't be a bad thing if you   want to know the fair but as it winds   down its years and it's becoming more   and more problematic it's gotten more   and more vicious more and more vile and   even the other mainstream media is   talking about the single greatest pi log   in history and all between now and   november eighth and you have to see the   stories they've written it's one after   another after another and facts mean   nothing third-rate journalism the great   editors of the past from the New York   Times and others ladies and gentlemen   are spinning in their grave I will not   allow the Clinton machine to turn our   campaign into a discussion of their   slanders and lies but will remain   focused on the issues facing the   American people   you   [Applause]   thank you thank you but let me state   this as clearly as I can these attacks   are orchestrated by the Clintons and   their media eliz the only thing Hillary   Clinton has going for herself is the   press without the press she is   absolutely zero and you saw that the   other night in the debate where some   people said she made virtually a fool of   herself this is not presidential   material believe me what they say is   false and slanderous in virtually every   respect we are now less than a month   from the most important election of our   lifetime indeed one of the most   important elections in the history of   our country and the polls are showing us   in a dead heat don't believe what you   said the new highly respected Rasmussen   poll just came out this morning it's   just released shows up nationally two   points ahead Trump you   just came out so now the Clinton machine   is put forward a small handful of people   out of tens of thousands of people over   the years that I've met that I've worked   with that I've employed in order to make   wild and false allegations that fail to   me even the most basic test of common   sense not even common sense again this   is nothing more than an attempt to   destroy our movement and for the   Clintons to keep their corrupt control   over a government when I declared my   candidacy I knew what bad shape our   country was in and believe me all you   have to do is look at world events all   you have to do is look at the 1.7   billion dollars that we sent to Iran in   cash in cash   all you have to do is see the way Isis   was created in the vacuum left by   Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama out of   Iraq all you have to do all you have to   do is look at the 800 people that were   very very not good for our nation they   were going to be deported lo and behold   instead of being deported they were made   citizens of the United States just   whistle and lo and behold sadly the 800   people is wrong it turned out to be   close to 1,800 people out president is   incompetent all he wants to do is   campaign and the last thing he wants to   happen is to have Donald Trump terminate   Obamacare and do all of the other things   that are destroyed   he's led a very divided nation and it's   only got the worst and the last thing   our country needs is four more years of   Barack Obama believe me I've seen   firsthand the corruption and the   sickness that has taken over our   politics you've seen it and I've seen it   and we're all watching together they   knew they would throw every lie they   couldn't me and my family and my loved   ones they knew they would stop at   nothing to try to stop me but I never   knew as bad as it would be i never knew   it would be this file that it would be   this bad that it would be this vicious   nevertheless I take all of these slings   and arrows gladly for you   [Applause]   I take them for our movement so that we   can have our country back our great   civilization here in America and across   the civilized world has come upon a   moment of reckoning we've seen it in the   United Kingdom where they voted to   liberate themselves from global   government and global trade deals and   global immigration deals that have   destroyed their sovereignty and have   destroyed many of those nations but the   central base of world political power is   right here an American and it is our   corrupt political establishment that is   the greatest power behind the efforts at   radical globalization and the   disenfranchisement of working people   their financial resources are virtually   unlimited their political resources are   unlimited their media resources are   unmatched and most importantly the   depths of their immorality is absolutely   unlimited   [Applause]   they will allow radical Islamic   terrorists to enter our country by the   thousands they will allow the great   Trojan horse and I don't want people   looking back in a hundred years and 200   years and have that story be told about   us because we were led by inept   incompetent and corrupt people like   Barack Obama and like Hillary Clinton we   don't want to be part of that history   and by the way President Obama should   stop campaigning and start working on   creating jobs start working on getting   our GDP up start working on   strengthening our borders the corrupt   political establishment is a machine it   has no soul I knew these false attacks   would come I knew this day would arrive   it's only a question of wet and I knew   the American people would rise above it   and vote for the future they deserve   the only thing that can stop this   corrupted machine is you the only force   strong enough to save our country is us   the only people brave enough to vote out   this corrupt establishment is you the   American people we are going to have a   policy America first   [Applause]   they control incredibly the Department   of Justice and they even secretly meet   with the attorney general of the united   states in the back of her airplane while   on the runway remember he was there he's   going to play golf oh gee this year 30   general oh let me go say hello planes in   the runway let me go say hello to the   Attorney General all he never got to   play golf I understand and it was   Arizona a place I love but the weather   was about a hundred and some-odd degrees   now he's not going to think he was never   there to play golf folks don't be   foolish they met for 39 minutes and most   likely it was to discuss her   reappointment in a Clinton   administration as the Attorney General   just prior to making a decision over   whether or not to prosecute Hillary   Clinton okay that's what happened that's   called real life and that's pretty sad   they met for 39 minutes remember he said   we talked to golf and we talked about   our grandchildren   three minutes for the grandchildren two   minutes for the Gulf then they SAT there   and they twiddle their thumbs now I   believe they talked about her remaining   in her position under a crooked Hillary   Clinton administration that's what I   believe that's what I believe folks   that's what I believe and I think that's   what most people in this room believe   [Applause]   likewise they have essentially corrupted   the director of the FBI to the point at   which stories are already saying that   the great and they are truly great men   and women who worked for the FBI are   embarrassed and ashamed of what he's   done to one of our truly great   institutions the FBI itself   Hillary Clinton is guilty of all the   things that director Comey stated at his   press conference and congressional   hearings and far more he stated many   things but it's far more and he knows   that and yet after reading all of these   items whereas she's so guilty he let her   off the hook while other lives including   General Petraeus and many others have   been destroyed for doing far far less   this is a conspiracy against you the   American people and we can not let this   happen or continue   this is our moment of reckoning as a   society and as a civilization itself I   didn't need to do this folks believe me   believe me I built a great company and a   wonderful life I could have enjoyed the   fruits and benefit of years of   successful business deals and businesses   for myself at my family instead of going   through this absolute horror show of   lies deceptions malicious attacks who   would have thought I'm doing it because   this country has given me so much and I   feel so strongly that it's my turn to   give back to the country that I love   [Applause]   many of my friends and many political   experts warned me that this campaign   would be a journey to hell said that but   they're wrong it will be a journey to   heaven because we will help so many   people that are so desperately in need   of help   [Applause]   in my former life I was an insider as   much as anybody else and I knew what   it's like and I still know what it's   like to be an insider it's not bad not   bad now I'm being punished for leaving   the special Club and revealing to you   the terrible things that are going on   having to do with our country because I   used to be part of the club I'm the only   one that can fix it I'm doing this for   the people and for the movement and we   will take back this country for you and   we will make America great again   to corrupt establishment knows that we   are a great threat to their criminal   enterprise they know that if we win   their power is gone and it's returned to   you the people will be the dark clouds   hanging over our government to be lifted   and replaced with a bright future but it   all depends on whether we let the   corrupt media decide our future or   whether we let the American people   decide our future this linton campaign   of destruction is allowed to work then   no other highly successful and this is   so true I mean I've see this so many   times and I've heard this all of my life   I've heard it all of my life if we let   this happen then no other highly   successful person which is what our   country needs it needs a certain   thinking when you look at our trade   deals that are so bad when you look as   an example on trade we're going to lose   almost 800 billion dollars this year   trade deficit almost 800 billion our   debt has doubled in seven and a half   years to almost 20 trillion dollars   under Obama   no other sick sexual person after   watching this and no other very   successful person will ever again ever   and who can blame them even me I'd say   you're right will ever again run for   office I've heard it for years if you're   very successful you can't run for high   office especially for president I said I   don't care I don't care I've done so   many games I've done so well it's a   certain mindset that we need in our   country at least for a period of time we   have to straighten our country out I   will not lie to you these false attacks   are absolutely hurtful to be lied about   to be slandered to be speared so   publicly and before your family that you   love is very painful what is going on is   egregious beyond anyone's people that   know the story people that see the story   people that know the facts they can't   even believe it it's reprehensible   beyond description it's totally corrupt   but I also know that it's not about me   it's about all of you and it's about our   country I know that I fully understood   that's why I got involved it's about all   of us together as a country it's a   movement the likes of which we have   never in history in this country seen   before never in history even the pundits   even the media that truly dislikes   Donald Trump for their own reasons will   admit this is a movement the likes of   which people have never seen before and   it's a movement about the veterans who   need medical care   the mothers who have lost their beloved   children to terrorism and to crime it's   about the inner cities and the border   towns who desperately need our help it's   about the millions of jobless people in   America it's about the American workers   who can't get jobs because our jobs have   left for Mexico and so many other   countries   [Applause]   this election is about the people being   crushed by obamacare and it's about   defeating Isis and appointing a Supreme   Court at a Supreme Court justice it   could be four or five who will defend   and protect our Constitution   [Applause]   this election is also about so   importantly to me african-american and   Hispanic American people whose   communities have been plunged into crime   poverty and failing schools by the   policies of crooked Hillary Clinton   believe me she's crooked they've robbed   these citizens of their future and if we   win I will give them their hope their   jobs their education I will give them   their security but the inner cities   education is almost worthless it's   horrible we're going to have common core   ended we're going to bring education   look but you look at the inner cities   and you see bad education no jobs no   safety you walk to the grocery store   with your child and you get shot you   walk outside to look and see what's   happening and you get shot in Chicago   3,000 people have been shot since   January first we're not going to let   that happen our inner cities are almost   at an all-time low run by the Democrats   for sometimes more than a hundred years   chain unbroken so they have no jobs they   have horrible education they have no   safety or security and I say to the   african-american community what the hell   do you have to lose I will fix it I will   fix it I will make it good I'll bring   back our jobs will have good education   will have great safety in the inner city   and we will help the Hispanic American   people who had been treated so badly and   so unfairly in our nation we will help   them I will deliver like you've never   seen before I deliver whether people   like Donald Trump or not they all say he   delivers vote for Donald Trump you're   going to see something and you be so   happy you'll be so thrilled this   election is about every man woman and   child in our country who deserves to   live in safety prosperity and peace so   true we will eyes above the lies

Hillary Clinton wants to double down   along the Canadian even more   I'm asking Wisconsin and for every   family in our country   real change   [Applause]   you know this is a movement like a   disease   and I said that and it sounds as people   [Music]   you son   horrible people untruthful me they would   be saying he said it is he attended   erica sommers and yet we're leaving with   all of the dishonesty were leading an ad   liquidating big and i think when you've   ever believed in me bigger   real chain also means deserve honesty   tower go as you know the FBI   investigation   this is the biggest scandal since water   again and now a good reporter there are   FBI this is the biggest reversing all   the plans in a circle she wants to blame   every guy is rules bro being virtually   all of Hillary Clinton Spencer she wants   to blame everyone else   [Applause]   you know somehow I think that Obamacare   is not going to be her biggest problem   but that makes that she wants to blame   everyone else for her mounting legal   troubles but she has really no one else   to blame but herself Hillary is the one   who set up an illegal private email   server to shield her criminal activity   you know that she knows it Hillary is   the one who engaged in a corrupt   pay-for-play scheme at the State   Department Hillary is the one who   endangered national security by sending   classified information on an insecure   server Hillary is the one who lied so   many times to Congress and to the FBI 39   times to the FBI in each lie I mean each   time she said I remember she does drive   she said sorry I don't recall don't   recall 39 times well each time she said   that that was also a life and I'm not   even including that Hillary is the one   who made 13 phones disappear some with a   hammer   it was Hillary who destroyed 33,000   emails after receiving a subpoena from   the United States Congress   [Music]   after and she is also the one this just   came up recently by the way if that were   rights for me or somebody it would have   been the biggest story in the world she   also accepted debate questions given to   her in advance and then used them to   cheat against Bernie Sanders   instead of reporting this terrible it's   a terrible breach instead of reporting   this terrible breach of ethics to the   public or to somebody she used you   notice they keep talking about donna   Brazile donna Brazile well donna Brazile   cheated and frankly she should resign   from the DNC she was just fired from the   network she should now resign from DNC   think of that can you imagine if Ryan's   got two questions for a debate gave them   to me and they found out you know it   would be a double electric chair right   fronting it would be front page in the   New York Times The Washington Post   hardly covered can you believe it she   got every to me at such a breach you   know being a student being a believer in   so many different things to me at such a   bridge she got the questions and didn't   report nobody even talks about that they   talk about donna Brazile but they don't   talk about Hillary Hillary got the   questions in a debate against Bernie   Sanders and she didn't report it surreal   cheating and it was hardly covered but   we know the answer so get out and vote   on november eighth remember   Hilary is not the victim the American   people of the victims of this rig and   corrupt system in every way and this is   your one chance to change it to one   chance I don't think you're going to   have another chance folks we have an   election coming up you're not going to   have another chance in four years you   can forget it if she were to be elected   it would create an unprecedented   constitutional crisis and the work of   government would grind to an   unbelievably on Gloria's halt she is   likely to be under investigation for   many years probably concluding in a very   large-scale criminal trial in a newly   released email John Podesta has been   caught saying we have to dump all of   those emails can you believe this that's   WikiLeaks and he also said to me this   made a big a big statement John Podesta   I tell you what if he worked for me I   would fire him so fast he is such an ass   tika he would I would fire him like the   apprentice John you're fired amazing   nasty guy he's a nasty guy   [Applause]   he's a nasty guy but he said you know   you don't like to say bad things you   work for people he said Hilary has bad   instincts Bernie Sanders said she's bad   judgment she's got both they're pretty   similar when you think about it as it   also turns out one of the top department   of justice officials the assistant   attorney general is a close associate of   Podesta the two met for dinner after   Clinton testified about Benghazi and   Podesta described him as the man who   kept him out of jail works for the   Justice Department   has our country ever had a situation   like is going on right now have we ever   had anything like it this is a good time   to make an important public service   announcement because a lot of things   have happened over the last few days   this is a message for any Democratic   voter who have already cast their   ballots for Hillary Clinton and who are   having a bad case of buyer's remorse in   other words you want to change give up   Wisconsin is one of several states where   you can change your early ballot if you   think you've made a mistake a lot of   stuff has come out since you voted so if   you live here or in Michigan or   Pennsylvania or Minnesota those four   places you can change your vote to   Donald Trump will make America great   again okay she is not going to make   America she will never make America   great the Clintons are the sordid past   we are the bright future and I say we we   sweet I'm a messenger I'm only a   messenger remember I'm only a message it   but you have to say I'm doing a pretty   good job as a messenger but I'm the   message my contract with the American   voter begins with a plan to restore   honesty and accountability to our   government finally   I want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment to hear and heed the words   we are all here to say when we win on   november eighth we are going to   Washington DC and we are going to drain   the swamp   [Applause]   yet I told I've said this before but it   was very interesting because when i   first heard the statement I said give me   a break i hate it i said are not giving   it I said it the people went crazy then   I went to a rally with 18,000 people I   said it they went totally crazy and then   I said it again again she's only been   going on for about a week and a half and   now i love it i love the statement and   it is very accurate at the core of my   contract is my plan to bring back our   jobs   right now 70 million American women and   children live in poverty or near the   brink of poverty 40 that's so true can   you believe in this country forty-three   percent of african-american school-age   children live in poverty thirty-two   percent of Hispanic school-age children   live in poverty this is our country this   is unacceptable in America I will fix it   I will fix it I will fix it   I've been saying a lot and I've been   saying and speaking very openly about   the inner cities and saying to the   african-american community the Hispanic   community I've been saying what do you   have to lose it's such a disaster what   do you have to lose thank you we're   going to fix it we're going to bring   back great schools we're going to stop   the crime the crime is unbelievable   we're going to bring back your jobs what   do you have to lose we're going to fix   it as your president I will go into the   poorest communities and work on a   national plan for revitalization we will   replace decades of failure with   generations of success we're going to   have generations of success America has   lost one third of its manufacturing jobs   since Bill and Hillary's and NAFTA you   know about that one third of your jobs   you know we have a highway one way   highway right into Mexico in these other   countries they get the jobs they get the   plants they get the money we get the   unemployment and the drugs not a good   deal that's going to be changed around   folks going to be changing   I mean you listen to this where America   has lost oh we're going to build the   wall don't worry about it we're gonna   build a wall that's not even close and   Mexico is going to pay for the wall and   they understand they understand America   has lost listen to this because it's   impossible I've been saying for two   weeks I just got this stat for two weeks   I've been saying oh that's a typo that   some kind of an error can't be possible   America has lost seventy thousand   factory 70,000 I thought they meant 700s   yeah of a mistake here maybe 7,000   America has lost seventy thousand   factories because of politicians that   don't know what they're doing or they're   controlled by their special interest   since China entered the World Trade   Organization another bill and hillary   backed disaster we are living through   the greatest jobs theft in the history   of the world that's what's happening to   our country we're being treated like   we're stupid people we have leaders that   don't know what they're doing we have   leaders that don't have a clue it's the   single greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world that's what's   happened to us hutchison technology   later a 411 workers right here and move   their jobs to thailand honeywell laid   off 974 workers making printed circuit   boards in Chippewa Falls their jobs but   you won't be clapping for this their   jobs went to China this is a federal   problem because Scott and these people   have kept so many places but there it's   very hard it's very hard because we   don't fight with our real tools meaning   you make your product you want to come   back not going to be so easy you going   to pay a nice big fat tax on that   product coming in   TTM technology laid off 166 workers and   most of them went into Mexico and other   places lots of jobs going to China lots   of jobs going to Japan lots of jobs   going to South Korea and unbelievable   numbers of jobs and plants and factories   and everything else going into Mexico   the Trump administration will stop the   job from leaving America and we will   stop the jobs from leaving Wisconsin   will work with your governor who is a   great great governor and we're going to   stop it we're going to stop it the theft   and that's what it is of American   prosperity will come to a very rapid end   from now on it's going to be America   first   [Applause]   a trump administration will renegotiate   NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign   product dumping all over currency   manipulation and all of the unfair   subsidy behavior that's going all over   our country makes it impossible   impossible for our businesses to compete   they'll be competing very soon we will   also immediately stop the job-killing   trans-pacific partnership that will be a   disaster as part of our plan to bring   back jobs we are going to lower taxes on   American businesses from thirty five   percent down to fifteen percent with a   highest tax nation in the world we will   become a rich nation again but to be a   rich nation we must also be a safer   nation in Chicago 3664 people have been   shot since January first of this year   can you believe that that's worse than   the places you read about and see in the   Middle East these awards owns we have   places that are more dangers in   Milwaukee homicides have risen to the   highest level in more than 20 years   nationwide murders have experienced   their largest single year increase in 45   years you don't hear that from the   dishonest media they don't tell you that   they don't tell you that   they don't tell you that they're there   for one reason they want to protect   certain people like Hilary it's getting   hard to protect her fellas it's getting   very getting very very hard to protect   her getting very hard to protect her   she's out of control a trump   administration will work with local and   federal law enforcement to end this   growing crime wave we have a crime wave   every child in America has the right to   grow up in safety and in peace   and we will also keep you safe from   terrorism Hillary Clinton wants a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees flowing into our country   who can even believe it her plan would   mean generations of terrorism and   extremism spreading in your schools and   throughout your communities when I'm   elected president we will suspend the   Syrian refugee program we have no choice   and we will keep radical Islamic   terrorists the hell out of our country   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and as I said and as you know   we're not playing games yes we will   build the wall   [Applause]   [Applause]   and the fact that it's a hundred and ten   degrees in this room I don't care think   of it as the sauna this room was not   designed for this many people think of   it as the sauna and to use the sooner   you have to pay money we get this for   nothing we've received the first-ever   endorsement from our ice and Border   Patrol officers first time they've ever   been 16,500 great amazing people they   tell us the border crisis is the worst   it's ever been you've been reading about   it it's a national emergency it's the   worst it's ever been right now you know   you try and get some stats they don't   want to give you the stats the worst   it's ever been right now just about as   bad as it gets Hillary has pledged   totally open borders there goes your   country   [Music]   which truly would mean the destruction   of the United States and a true sense   the immigration officers warned in a   letter when they endorsed me that   Hillary's plan is quote the most radical   immigration proposal in united states   history and that it would quote lead to   the loss of thousands and thousands of   lives as Secretary of State Hillary   Clinton allowed thousands of the most   dangerous and violent criminal aliens to   go free because their home countries   very intelligently would not take them   back they don't want to take back   murderers drug lords gang members they   say no and let me just tell you   something they would bring them to their   country their country would say no get   them out bring them back to the United   States where your leaders are stupid   people bring them back to the United   States let me tell you that won't happen   whether it's four years or eight years   that won't happen once if I'm president   not once   one such criminal was set free on   Hillary's watch went on to kill young   American girl of fantastic young woman   named Casey Chadwick he probably read   about her the killer who had already   been convicted for shooting a girl in   the head previously and who people were   begging to incarcerate or send out of   our country should have been sent home   instead he was set free and stabbed   Casey in the face and neck 15 different   times and stuffed her body in a closet   people were begging that he be sent out   we're gonna make America safe again   believe me   [Applause]   that's one of many that's one of many so   many different stories Hillary also   strongly supports sanctuary cities like   in San Francisco where the incredible   Kate Steinle incredible young woman was   killed in her father's arms by a   five-time deported illegal immigrant a   trump administration will cancel all   federal funding to sanctuary cities we   will deport all criminal elements stop   the drugs from pouring into our   communities and we will end this long   nightmare of violence like we've never   seen before we will also repeal the   obama-clinton defense sequester and   rebuild our badly depleted military we   have no choice we have no choice that   includes great support for nearby Fort   McCoy I'm honored to have the   endorsement of more than 200 top   Admirals and generals and 22 medal of   honor recipients it's a great group   nobody has like we have whether it's law   enforcement the military the veterans   and we are going to take care of our   veterans   our new foreign policy will put America   first Hillary brought disaster to Iraq   just total disaster to Iraq Syria Libya   she empowered Iran and she unleashed   Isis with the great void that was   created by the way her and President   Obama the campaigner I called the   campaigning he ought to focus instead of   campaigning for Hillary Clinton where   he's probably now got a conflict in   campaigning for he ought to focus on   bringing jobs back to our country focus   on getting rid of Isis focus on lots of   other things now Hilary wants to start a   shooting war in Syria a conflict with a   nuclear-armed Russia that could frankly   for all we know could trigger World War   3 for what Hillary in our failed   Washington establishment have spent six   trillion dollars on wars in the Middle   East that never end and that we never   win remember that they'd never end and   we never win and now the Middle East is   in worse shape than ever before we could   have built our country twice we could   have rebuilt the United States with six   trillion dollars we could have rebuilt   it twice they've dragged us into foreign   wars that have made us less safe they   have left our borders wide open at home   and they've shipped our jobs and wealth   to other countries to all Americans I   say it is now time finally for new   leadership for change   thank you   in closing just think about what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days we are   going to have the biggest tax cut since   Ronald Reagan and she is going to raise   your taxes substantially remember we are   going to eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation we will cancel   every illegal Obama executive order   there are plenty of plenty of there are   plenty of we will rebuild our military   and we will take care of our great great   veterans we're going to take care of   them they've been treated terribly   terribly our veterans have been treated   terribly   thank you   we are going to provide school choice   and put an end to common core we're   bringing our education local   [Applause]   we will support the great men and women   of law enforcement that will

movement like   nobody's ever seen before it really is   some movement they're considering it a   great phenomena I consider it a great   phenomena if we win on November 8 that's   what I can say   well my opponents Landers you as   deplorable and irredeemable I call you   hard-working American patriots who love   your country and want a better future   for all of our people her comments   displayed the same sense of arrogance   and entitlement that led her to violate   federal laws Secretary of State Hyde and   the leader eat males I mean think 33,000   emails and that's just one batch it's a   lot of wedding talk it's a lot of   wedding time but classified information   in the reach of our enemies lied to   Congress and sell government favors and   access through the Clinton Foundation   it's this attitude of arrogance that   explains why Hillary Clinton made 13   phones disappear including with a hammer   so the FBI couldn't see them and why she   bleached her emails after a   congressional subpoena that's after the   subpoena came this isn't before that's   after the subpoena came now the people   who destroyed the emails are all   pleading the Fifth Amendment in front of   Congress today have you seen have you   seen what's going on in front of   Congress Fifth Amendment Fifth Amendment   Fifth Amendment horrible horrible and   will anything happen that's going to be   the question we'll find out anyone   watching today's hearing in Congress   knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are   far more corrupt than we ever imagined   it's happened today   this is far bigger and a far bigger   scandal than Watergate ever was but with   Watergate we had justice we had a   Justice Department that went after the   people here's something that just nobody   has ever seen anything like this folks   what we're witnessing is a first we've   never ever seen anything like this this   is a scandal that threatens national   security and   a multi-million dollar pay-for-play   scheme between the secretary of state   and her foundation whether it's her   emails her disasters in Iraq Libya and   Syria or her failures on the economy of   which it's been disastrous Hillary   Clinton lacks the judgment temperament   and moral character to lead this country   she does you know it everybody knows   everybody knows everybody knows it in   the words of a Secret Service agent   posted outside her office she simply   lacks the integrity and the temperament   to serve in the office from the bottom   of my soul he said I know this to be   true the policies of Hillary Clinton   have produced death destruction overseas   it's been disastrous no matter where you   look everything she's touched has been a   disaster and produced only failing   schools rising crime job loss shrinking   incomes and tragic poverty at home you   want four more years of it had a feeling   you might say that   it's so sad to see what's going on our   country is so sad one in five American   households do not have a single member   in the labor force   another 14 million people left the labor   force since 2009 and the national debt   has doubled to nearly 20 trillion   dollars during the Obama years I'm   running to reverse these policies and to   create a future of prosperity for all   Americans all America that includes   you'll be happy to hear this our family   farms right here in Iowa family farms   the farmers are being left out in the   cold family farms are the backbone of   this country we are going to end the EPA   intrusion into your family homes and   your family farm   we are going to protect the renewable   fuel standard corn based ethanol   eliminate job-killing regulations like   the waters of the u.s. rule and provide   desperately needed tax relief our plan   lowers the tax rate on family farms down   to 15% from 35% and you watch your farms   grow you watch businesses all over the   country grow you watch jobs come back   it'll be a beautiful thing and remember   this the double taxation of family farms   a debt you want to leave your farms your   children it's a disaster because it   doesn't happen so helping to ensure that   the family farm we have to make and we   have to continue the tradition in Iowa   we want it to continue to thrive with   your family and you'll be looking down   at your family and you'll be proud ok so   we're going to take care of that my   economic agenda can be summed up in   three words jobs jobs jobs   that means we're going to negotiate   trade deals to protect our farmers help   them export their goods and make money   doing it because the way it is now it's   impossible and grow family farming in   America we're going to grow the farms my   first day in office I'm also going to   order a review of every single   regulation issued over the last 10 years   all needless job-killing regulations   will be cancelled millions and millions   of new jobs will come pouring into our   country we're going to lift the   restrictions on American energy which   means lower electricity prices for our   farmers and half a million jobs a year   at least probably a number much higher   than that and that will just be the   beginning also on my first day I'm going   to ask Congress to send me a bill to   immediately repeal and replace   disastrous Obama care   this will instantly save another two   million jobs at least probably more than   that by the way remember Jonathan Gruber   anybody remember that name people forgot   a long time ago but some people remember   I see that Jonathan Gruber was the   architect of Obamacare and he said   remember they got him I guess on a cell   phone or somehow but they got him he   said the lack of transparency was   essential to passing the legislation and   then he talked about like and I quote   the stupidity of the American voter   having to do with Obamacare the   stupidity an exact quote the stupidity   of the American voter and this is what   we get   this is the hateful attitude of insiders   like Mr Gruber and Hillary Clinton and   the voters have had enough of this on   November 8 we're taking back our country   November 8   another major reform is going to be   school choice and by the way we're   getting rid of common core we're   bringing it local bringing it away   totally getting rid of common core   common core is a disaster   all you have to do is look at the   rankings of schools and see that we pay   the most per pupil not even close and   we're down on the bottom of the list so   can't do that it's gonna be a lot of   changes really good changes I've   outlined a plan to provide every   disadvantaged child in America the   freedom to choose the public private   magnet religious school of his or her   choice this will help lift millions of   poor african-american and Hispanic   children out of poverty if the poverty   is beyond belief you don't think of it   with this country the poverty is beyond   belief   it's time to break up the failed   Democratic control over our inner cities   and provide real hope and opportunity to   every single community in this nation we   have to bring everybody with us   everybody   our policies on taxes trade regulations   and education will grow incomes boost   jobs and reduce poverty for our   african-american and Hispanic   communities we have to do it we have to   bring these communities into a great   system and we have to bring these   communities back we have to do it we   need a new civil rights agenda for our   time one that promises safe   neighborhoods great education and a   secure job nearly four and ten   african-american children live in   poverty including forty five percent of   african-american children under the age   of six forty five percent fifty eight   percent of african-american youth are   not working   violent crime rose in America's 50   largest cities list your homicides are   up 50 percent in DC and more than 60   percent in Baltimore and everywhere else   they're through the roof over 3,000   people have been shot in Chicago since   January 1st of this year 3,000 people   there's shooting on average every two   hours to those suffering and hurting I   say what do you have to lose I'll fix it   vote for Donald Trump I mean that what   do you have to lose   it can't get any worse and I say this   too I say this to the african-american   community it can't get any worse can't   get any worse 40% poverty 58% can't get   jobs youth it can't get any worse I'll   fix it remember that and Hillary just   wants your vote and then she'll say see   you in four years okay bye-bye   and you see what's happened with our   inner cities well you can't walk down   the street without being shot and you   see the crime and all of the problems   what do you have to lose I will fix it   believe me I'll bring back millions of   jobs higher wages and great schools I   will make your communities safe safety   also means protecting our people from   radical Islamic terrorism   I hate even saying this but this just   happened new video has just been   released showing Isis absolute butchers   murdering innocent people in what has   been called a Syrian slaughterhouse the   victims were dragged then hung from meat   hooks and then their throats were slit   so we have nope no question we've got to   name the problem which Hillary and and   as you know President Obama they won't   do we're going to name the problem and   we've got to solve the problem we've got   to solve the problem this is an evil   sadistic monstrous enemy and we must   keep these killers out of our country   we know for a fact that Isis is trying   to infiltrate refugee flows no question   about spoof and to recruit refugees   after their entry into our country my   opponent wants a five hundred and fifty   percent increase in Syrian refugees over   and above then you've got a vote for   Trump it's very simple very simple   that's five hundred and fifty percent   increase over and above the Obama   administration thousands and thousands   once five hundred and fifty percent   higher we have no idea who these people   are where they come from we have no idea   we have no idea what we're getting into   we have no idea according to the Senate   Subcommittee on immigration her entire   plan will bring in six hundred and   twenty thousand refugees in her first   term and costs four hundred billion   dollars in lifetime benefits   instead of providing free health care   and jobs to refugees from around the   world   we should rebuild our inner cities and   help struggling Americans get jobs all   over our country and we all have a heart   we all have a heart and so I support   totally construction of safe zones in   the region but we don't want to pay we   owe 20 trillion 20 trillion nobody even   knows what it means 20 trillion so what   we're gonna do is we're gonna get   exactly we're gonna get the Gulf states   to pay for it we'll eat it we'll get   them to pay for it they've got plenty of   money they just have nobody to ask them   you got to put up the money maybe tell   them cuz a better statement at the same   time as we rebuild our military we are   going to get our allies to pay their   fair share only five of the 28 member   NATO countries meet their obligations to   spend 2% of GDP on defense   I will convene a summit of our European   and Asian allies to make sure everyone   is sharing in the burden of security we   are paying tremendous amounts of money   to secure other nations to protect and   defend other nations we are going to be   made whole we have no choice this isn't   30 years ago   this isn't 40 years ago and I believe   properly asked will be in a very good   position and they'll be very nice about   it got to be properly and we've gonna   then focus and we have to focus on   radical Islamic terrorism we're going to   be focused on in all things it's time to   put Americans first we don't do them and   we have to start taking care of each   other which we're not doing tonight I'm   going to roll out a plan to help our   mothers and our families get affordable   quality child care for their children   and my daughter Ivanka is going to be   involved she's the one   she is the one that has been pushing for   it so uh daddy daddy we have to do this   and it's true she's very smart and she's   right on policy after policy we're going   to provide opportunity prosperity and   security for all Americans which we   don't have now at all I'm going to lower   your taxes I'm going to get rid of   massive amounts of unnecessary   regulations on business and in your life   we're going to as I said repeal and   replace Obamacare I'm going to appoint   justices of the United States Supreme   Court who will follow the Constitution   I'm going to rebuild our very depleted   military and take care of our great vets   for the first time I'm going to save   your Second Amendment which is under   siege and as you know the NRA endorsed   me very early earlier than anybody else   and I'm very honored by that endorsement   but the NRA you know what they're doing   with our Second Amendment they're   fighting to save it it's a very tough   fight   another reason we need help and we have   to have the help from the United States   Supreme Court and if the wrong justices   get appointed starting with the great   Justice Scalia who unexpectedly passed   away so now we have a tie Court if   somebody takes this place I think you   could wave your Second Amendment as you   know it you can wave it goodbye can wave   it goodbye so all of you that are big   Second Amendment proponents and   believers you better get out there in   you better vote or you're not gonna have   much of a second a moment November 8 I'm   going to stop illegal immigration and   I'm going to stop drugs from pouring   into our country and yes we will build   the wall and you're right Mexico will   pay for the wall they will pay for the   world   we will build the wall folks we've got   to stop the drugs from pouring in we've   got to build the wall the endorsement of   all of the Border Patrol agents first   time they've ever done that they're   endorsing a presidential candidate they   said mr. Trump the wall is so necessary   it's a tool for them another tool but   one of the most important ones but they   said to me the wall is so important and   when I look at the drugs that pour in   pour in they're poisoning our youth you   look at New Hampshire you look at   Pennsylvania you look at Ohio you look   at all the states one of the biggest   things and in some cases their single   biggest problem is the drug inflow   heroin we're gonna stop the drugs from   poisoning our youth and plenty of other   people we will build a wall and I'm   going to so importantly renegotiate your   horrible trade deals especially NAFTA   which is maybe the single worst trade   deal ever made by any country anywhere   in the world it's just a one-way street   right now it's a one-way street for jobs   being ripped out of our country leaving   the United States going to Mexico and   other place it's a one-way street we're   gonna have a nice double lane highway   but much of the stuff is going to be   coming in the opposite direction at   least for a long while till we can get   ourselves even   and remember this Bill Clinton signed   NAFTA so Bill Clinton signed the worst   trade deal in the history of the world   folks I mean it's not like it's in the   history of the world has never been a   worse or a Dumber deal for trade   including TPP which is a disaster but   TPP I don't believe will be as bad as   NAFTA and as you know Hillary Clinton   totally wants to approve TPP she said   it's the gold standard then she heard a   speech of mine and she said wow I better   say I'm gonna reject it but we all know   that if she won she would sign pipi as   you know that you know it she'll sign   the TPP and if she signs it it will be   catastrophic for not only Iowa for our   country so we can't let that happen we   can't let that happen we in negotiating   deals are going to do something very   very simple we're going to put America   but we're going to put the American   worker first very simple it's very it's   a very simple thing we don't think in   terms of this country it's almost like I   was thinking about it over the last   couple of weeks in particular it's   almost like they want these other   countries to do so well it's I'm saying   we are because nobody can make deals   that badly but when you think about it   the reason they are bad is because of   the donors the special interests in many   cases they own these countries that are   leaving the country and ripping us and   we're going to stop it and it's so easy   to stop the globalists and it's so easy   to stop and we're going to stop it and   I'll tell you another thing   Apple and our other major companies will   start making their iPhones their   computers and other products in the   United States not in China and not all   over the world   because we don't make things here like   we used to anymore we're going to start   making things in our country we're going   to start having the jobs be jobs that   are good for our country   we're gonna rebuild our roads our   bridges our tunnels our highways our   airports our schools and our hospitals   American cars will travel the roads   American airplanes will soar the skies   and American ships will patrol the seas   we don't make ships American steel will   send new skyscrapers into the clouds and   American hands will rebuild this nation   an American energy mind from American   sources will power our great nation   American workers will be hired to do the   job we will put new American metal into   the spine of this country American metal   and American steel I will fight for   every neglected part of the nation and I   will fight to bring us all together as   one American people which were not we   are so badly divided imagine what our   country could accomplish if we started   working together as one people under one   God saluting one American flag one   America   it's time to break with the bitter   failures of the past and to embrace a   new inclusive and prosperous and I mean   truly prosperous American future we   could be better than we ever were we can   we can be better we can be greater than   we ever were I know the people I've   traveled I've seen thousands I've seen   millions of people incredible people we   can be greater than ever before jobs   will return incomes will rise and new   factories will come rushing back to our   shores once more we will have a   government of By and For the People   we will make America prosperous again we   will make America safe again we will   make America great again thank you god   bless you everybody thank you very much   thank you November right thank you   everybody   [Music]

infrastructure   including major projects in our   innocence we did take care of our nurses   we're going to get the inner city   scolding again remember using fresh it   what the hell do you have to lose I'm   telling you you're going to see and I   want to thank we had we did so well so   much better with african-american   communities with a static can anybody   so much better   better than a sacred place in years back   in years back so I want to thank the   african-american community I want to   thank is that community stand we're   starting to work already we're working   on it and the appointment today at Ben   Carson's been very popular very well we   see dr. Benoit good guy   we will have two simple rules when it   comes to rebuilding this country by   American and hire a fireman on trade our   trade deficit now nearly 800 billion   dollars a year we have a deficit think   of it of almost 800 billion dollars a   year you always say just because shading   this is is a chronic drag on the growth   and a destroyer of jobs and well for the   month of October alone our nation racked   up more than 40 billion dollars in trade   x 40 billion including more than a 30   billion dollar trade deficit with China   alone all right they would go to jump in   the ocean I don't think so how many   business people do we have in this   audience included a slightly better job   of the gosh   you can North Carolina's most nearly   half of its manufacturing jobs since   that America's lost seventy thousand   factories they give 70,000 factors since   joining the World Trade Organization   think of it so China joins the World   Trade Organization and since that time   we've lost so much 70,000 factors will   let me clue the greatest jobs left it is   you do of this ever better job stuff   like what's happened to this country   then we stop some of it a little bit   because we just started have really   started he's gonna really start on   january twentieth but we're stopping and   one of the wealthiest men in the world   you saw it today maybe good anybody seen   matzah right Massa great guy of Japan   he's pledged that he's going to put 50   billion dollars into the United States   because of our vacay he wasn't investing   in a 15 thing   fifty thousand jobs 50,000 jobs he's   going to be investing he's a great guy a   tough administration will renegotiate   our terrible tragedies send up to 40 G   and defeat every last a market and we   will do this we will defeat the enemy on   jeffs and we will defend American jobs   we're going to defend American James and   we have to look at almost as a war   because that's what's happening to   assess what's happened to our workers   these are great people and boy they come   out of Ember they said they don't exist   they existed exist believe me it means   and millions of people born after the   volume oh so they voted big league   that's why we have this kind of interest   we had six well when winning by 30   points 35 points40 points what makes   what if a company wants to fire their   workers leave our country and then ship   their products back into our country   there will be consequences I'm sorry   on health care reform every day the law   known as Obamacare is destabilizing your   health care really the same lesson   certain premiums and fortunately   providers out of the park and we are not   the damage will be irreversible we're   going to act that is why we're going to   repeal and replace the loan can we have   no choice we have   we have absolutely   so we're going to repeal and replace   Obamacare and you're going to get health   care at a much lower price with a much   lower deductible the duck but you know   it's so high then you can't you really   can and from the most fun you can use   but we are going to have great health   care and a much lower price when child   can best accomplish the best legislation   to make safe and affordable child care   accessible to all and people like that   that's something that Ivanka Trump did   anybody ever hear of your uncle Jumba   Ivanka Trump has been fighting for for a   long time and I have and I agree on   crime the murder rate is experienced its   largest increase in 45 years we are   going to support the incredible men and   women of law enforcement and we are   going to bring this terrible crime wave   highest in 45 years to murder on   immigration we will be the   administration that ended illegal   immigration we will construct a great   border wall to span till the criminal   cartels liberate our communities from   the epidemic of gang violence and drugs   we will get rid of the drugs that   mortgage   we will ask Congress to reform our visa   and immigration programs to protect jobs   and wages for American workers and we   will be avoiding very shortly somebody   to head up our program and I will tell   you this person like general mattis who   knew phenomenal job because we're going   to stop people from coming into our   country illegally but we want to have   people come into our country and then   come in by the thousands and hundreds of   thousands but they're going to come in   they are going to come in Legally right   but by the hundreds

we're going to drain the swamp of rock   in Washington DC where gone I will   oppose the five-year ban on executive   branch officials becoming lovers and a   lifetime ban on officials becoming   lobbies for a foreign government we face   many many challenges but this is truly   an exciting tag to be alive in our   country and hopefully to be alive in   many of the locations because we are

Donald J Trump   thank you everybody thank you thank you   thank you so I thought we'd start a   little bit early go home and watch   football and your team now all of your   fans are pouring in there outside   virginia tech won the game 54 to 17   amazing Lane Stadium and they're all   outside try to come in so let's not wait   right it's great to be in Virginia a   state where I have so many great friends   and wonderful employees I have some   great properties here with great great   employees it's tremendous and we have   wonderful poles they just keep coming in   a brand-new rasmussen poll just out has   us leading by five points nationwide   and on November a we are going to win   this state and we are going to win the   White House we're going to take it back   we're going to take on the big donors   and big business and big media we're   going to take on the rig system that has   shipped America's wealth to other   countries and they keep doing so we're   going to replace our failed and corrupt   establishment with a government that   serves you your family and your country   my economic agenda can be summed up in   some very very powerful words jobs jobs   jobs   we will cut taxes for all working in   middle-class households in America we   will reduce regulations which will put   more money into the hands of our poorest   workers and bring thousands of new   companies to our shores we will unleash   American energy creating millions of new   jobs and lowering energy costs for   everyone we will repeal and replace   Obamacare   President Obama promises plan would   reduce premiums by two thousand five   hundred dollars a year instead they've   surged to five thousand dollars a year   more our replacement plan that's true   includes expanded access to health care   savings accounts with support for those   who need it it includes allowing   Americans to buy health insurance across   state lines in all 50 states a diamond   right   a dynamic and competitive new market   they will be competing for your business   you will be making your own deals and   they'll be greater than you ever thought   possible believe me a lot of those deals   today you don't even know what they're   going to be because they're going to get   better and better all the time with   competition we're also going to block   grant Medicaid estates so they can   develop innovative solutions to make   sure no citizen in poverty ever falls   through the cracks never high-risk pools   will also help to ensure that those with   pre-existing conditions will always get   the quality coverage they need on train   we are going to end the international   abuse the foreign cheating and the   one-sided rules that govern NAFTA   [Applause]   what a deal that is and the World Trade   Organization right now America   eliminates its tariffs but then other   countries tax our goods with backdoor   tariffs and close their markets in other   words they tax us but we don't tax them   not too good   and you know how that's been working out   folks it's a one-way highway out of this   country for our jobs and our money our   massive chronic trade deficits are   destroying the middle class and shifting   money away from workers to large   corporations who have no borders there's   a reason the Wall Street donors are   giving tens of millions of dollars to my   opponent Hillary Clinton is the voice   for global special interests I'm running   to be the voice of the Forgotten men and   women of this country believe me they   are forgot   my opponent likes to say that for   decades she's been fighting for women   that she's been fighting for children   why then are 70 million American women   and children living in poverty or in the   brink of poverty in our country why has   she provided no relief for the millions   of Americans in search of affordable   reliable quality childcare for years   he's been doing this and she's done   nothing you know the old saying watch   what I do not what I say at the Trump   Organization and in my campaign for   president women occupy some of the   highest positions I have employed   thousands of women in my company women   of different backgrounds women of many   talents and just last week joined by my   daughter Ivanka no evanka   I laid out my plan for child care and   elder care that plan has many great   features including tax free child care   savings account low-income parents are   given tax credits they can put straight   into those accounts and then get a five   hundred dollar per child match for those   savings accounts deposits families can   also deduct the cost of child care from   their taxes a huge tax cut for the   middle class we also have and as we've   been doing we've been talking a lot   about improving education my plan   includes school choice for every single   disadvantaged child in America and we're   going to get rid of and totally end   common core   we're also going to bring down the cost   of college universities get massive   federal funds and huge tax breaks for   their endowments but then they don't   spend those funds or those endowments on   their students I will work with Congress   to make sure these special federal   benefits are not available unless   universities begin to reduce tuition and   student debt it's too expensive this   will get to them and this will get it   this will really do it the problem this   is the problem and it's right smack in   the middle of the source and reduce both   the costs for students and the course   for taxpayers our students are drowning   in debt and we're going to fix it   women also by the way value security   they want a commander-in-chief that will   defeat radical Islamic terrorism stop   it's time going on too long it's now in   30 countries started off in a little   area they left a big vacuum Hillary   Clinton and Barack Obama and now it's in   30 countries may be more than that we   want to stop the massive inflow of   refugees protect our borders   and we want to reduce the rising crime   and violence in our cities   [Applause]   we will build a wall I promise we will   build the wall   and Mexico will pay for the wall they   will as I campaign across this country I   hear so many stories and pleas from   women especially about drug addiction   and opioid use they are doing their best   in their communities and for their   families to provide a safe and nurturing   environment but even the best-laid plans   cannot always protect our youth and   increasingly many adults from the   scourge of drugs this is a scourge we   lose thousands of our fellow Americans   every year to drugs and opioid use I   will stop the drug inflow from our   borders believe me   these terrible drugs come over the   border and make their way into our urban   and rural communities and into our   suburbs this must stop this must change   and the people that are there now your   so-called leadership group will never   ever change it and that includes Hilary   believe me every change starts with a   conversation together we will have this   conversation and we will make this   change one hundred percent the change   will start immediately here in Virginia   we are going to end the war on American   energy and on our miners   Hillary Clinton says she wants to put   the miners out of work   Clinton and Kane also want to shut down   shell and shut down natural gas what   they've done is incredible the Clinton   regulatory agenda will drive up   electricity prices for Virginia families   you know that you're already seeing it   and will cost the US economy over five   trillion dollars by the way Tim Kaine   less than a week after taking office in   Virginia proposed a four billion dollar   tax ID on your steak a four billion   dollar hike including on people earning   as little as seventeen thousand dollars   a year one week in office and he   proposed a four billion dollar tax hike   and you know he's not very popular he   won his election by a very very close   margin when I heard she picked I said   you know maybe that's bad for me we're   just about tied in Virginia and we   haven't started advertising and they're   spending a fortune she made the wrong   pic we are going to open up all sources   of American energy and bring jobs well   and cheaper electricity to Virginia and   all over the country another major part   of our agenda is safety I believe every   family in America is entitled to live in   safety and in peace   today the nation just opened the   Smithsonian National Museum of American   History african-american art it's really   a beautiful place I saw it the other day   and going around Washington and it   looked beautiful and we're all very   proud of it i can tell you that we   congratulate and honor those involved   with the project and recognize today the   incredible contributions of the   african-american community to this   nation african-americans have given so   much to our nation and sacrifice so much   for this nation many African Americans   are succeeding so greatly in our country   and I will make sure their success is   protected and supported at the same time   too many African Americans have been   left behind and trapped in poverty I   will fight to make sure every single   african-american child in this country   is fully included in the American dream   [Music]   that includes the new civil rights issue   of our time school choice Democrats have   run the inner cities for half a century   or more and produce only more   joblessness and more poverty the jobs   are leaving the schools are failing and   crime is rising like never before in the   inner cities so to those African   American and Hispanic voters I say vote   for Donald Trump what do you have to   lose   I will fix it I will fight harder for   you than anyone has before the policies   of Hillary Clinton have brought only   suffering in our inner cities just like   her bad judgment overseas unleashed   suffering everywhere she went she's got   bad judgment of course she got rich   through it all the Clintons made another   60 million dollars in gross income while   she was Secretary of State think of that   worst of all she put her public office   up for sale and then bleach surrey mills   and destroyed her iphones with a hammer   to try and cover up her tracks following   a congressional subpoena figure that one   out   [Applause]   there's a reason the hedge fund managers   are donating to Hillary Clinton's   campaign and not mine everybody getting   rich off the rig system and who wants   really nothing but keeping it the same   they want to keep it just to save and   they're throwing their money at Hillary   Clinton I wonder why my campaign is   powered by my own money and buy small   dollar donations for everybody and all   of our patriotic citizens   ninety percent of our donors are small   dollar donations and we're setting   records for Republican Party records   every dollar helps us deliver your   County your country your area Virginia   and I'll tell you what it all   essentially goes back to you because   we're just going to make it a better   place where we keep our jobs and we   bring new jobs in our campaign is about   breaking up the special interest   monopoly in Washington DC we're trying   to disrupt the collusion between the   wealthy donors the large corporations   and the media executives   [Applause]   they're all part of the same political   establishment they go to the same   restaurants they attend the same   conferences they have the same friends   and connections they all support the   same ideology of globalism that makes   them rich while shipping your jobs your   factories and you wealth to other   countries all over the place in   particular lately to Mexico I'm not   running to be President of the world I'm   running to be President of the United   States and turn things around   I am for America and for America first   always America first   together we will rebuild this country   beyond and I mean beyond any of our   dreams we have such unbelievable   potential in our country such   unbelievable I mean the potential we   have in this country I've gone all over   the country or the crowds everything   it's so incredible the people are so   incredible our leaders are leading us   down a deadly path whether it's our   military that's so depleted the greatest   people on earth they have depleted   equipment everything's wrong our vets   are being so badly treated our veterans   how many veterans do we have today you   have illegal immigrants being treated   better than our veterans in many cases   that's not going to happen that's not   going to happen anymore government will   start working again fixing things is   what I do just look at my projects in   New York City where I turn rundown   spaces into new centers of business   activity and opportunity where others   saw only problems i saw amenda spittle   we turned empty lots into homes offices   and living memories for thousands of   workers and their families that's what I   do and that's what I will continue to do   for our country but on a very very big   scale believe me I want to go in   I want to go into our neglected   neighborhoods the failing schools the   Forgotten stretches of this nation and   unlock their potential for all of our   people I've made a living for years   looking at unused spaces and imagining   what they could be it's been a great   living politicians look at blighted   neighborhoods and offer only excuses and   by the way all they want is the vote in   the inner city in particular give us   your vote and then we'll see you in four   years that's what it is they do nothing   I look at those same neighborhoods and   offer solutions everything broken today   can be fixed all we have to do is to now   the doubters the cynics and the   naysayers and there are plenty of them   we are a nation of strivers dreamers and   believers and that's the spirit that   will carry us to victory in November and   two great victories as a nation we will   be respected again as a nation   it's that same spirit of resilience I've   seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in   Louisiana or meeting with the incredible   but hard hit people in cities and towns   like flint michigan what a shame what a   shame what they've done in flint spend   hundreds of millions of dollars to   destroy the water system if they would   have left it alone it would have been   okay hundreds of millions of dollars and   now they're going to need hundreds of   millions of dollars more and it used to   be where the cars were made in Flint and   you couldn't drink the water in Mexico   today the cars are made in Mexico and   you can't drink the water in Flint   Michigan no good folks no

Donald J   this is a lot of people so that   gentleman has real bravery the recipient   of the Congressional Medal of Honor   that's great stuff thank you very much   that was great thank you in 14 days we   are going to win the state of Florida   and we are going to win back the White   House   early voting in Florida is underway so   make sure you get out and vote we have a   thing going on that they've never seen   before it's a movement they've never   seen anything like it before we're going   to win and we're going to bring back a   lot of good things including common   sense to the White House seventy-five   percent of the american people think at   our country is on the wrong track we   have no doubt about that we are going to   fix it we are going to get our country   right back on the right track together   we're going to deliver real change that   puts America first America first we   haven't heard that term in a long time   right we don't put America first anymore   we're going to start starting next year   as soon as we take office it's America   first again that begins with immediately   repealing and replacing Obamacare   [Applause]   as you know it's just been announced   that Americans are going to experience   another massive double-digit spike in   Obamacare premiums including more than a   one hundred percent increase in the   great state of Arizona they're going up   over a hundred percent think of it and   everybody is going to be going up like   that they gave a number of twenty-five   percent average they know that's not   true they wanted to try and get out of   you know get in front they know that's   not true it's much more you're going to   have sixty seventy eighty ninety percent   increases in Obamacare we're going to   repeal it and we're going to replace it   and we're going to get you great great   health care at a fraction of the cost   one in five Americans trapped and   Obamacare will have only a single   insurer to choose from lot's of luck in   that negotiation even Bill Clinton   admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing   I've ever seen in the world where people   wanted to paying their premiums doubled   and their coverage is cutting to have   well you know what he's right but he   suffered that night Dorothy the Democrat   governor of Minnesota said the   Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable insurers are leaving   companies are fleeing jobs are being   lost wages are being slashed its killing   our businesses it's killing our small   businesses it's killing individuals and   it's no good deductable czar so high you   can't use it you'll never get to use it   job-killing Obamacare is just one more   way that our system is rigged believe me   remember Jonathan Gruber of em I key the   architect of Obamacare he said they   could pass Obamacare because the   stupidity of the American voter the   stupidity he called the American   voter's stupid the only stupidity with   the stupidity and you know that and it   is the stupidity of our politicians who   ran this monster down our throats and   I'll tell you from the beginning I was   against it from the beginning I said it   wasn't going to work and it didn't work   it didn't work and it's going to get   worse and Hillary Clinton wants to keep   it she wants to spend a fortune on it   she wants to keep it and your numbers   are going to get up up up and it's going   to get worse worse worse repeal it and   replace it this morning I spent some   time with the incredible employees at   Trump national in doral in Miami which   we own I'm proud of the fact that employ   thousands and thousands of people all   over Florida and a state is an amazing   state but I'm also proud to provide them   with benefits including health care   unfortunately a small number of the   people that work at Trump national in   doral which is Miami their own Obamacare   small percentage and as I said this   morning they are having tremendous   difficulty in fact a lot of them have   said can you take me off Obamacare see   what we could I do it or not so I take   them off maybe I well I'll mention you   folks when I do it now but it's a small   group but it's a group that's having   tremendous problems with Obamacare   because of what's going on with the   premiums and what's going on with the   deductibles again they can't use it but   we're going to get these people help   we're going to get the people of the   country help we are going to start   replacing it we are going to have a   great health care system in the United   States and a system that you can afford   so remember if you vote for Hillary   Clinton she wants to double down on   Obamacare and make it even more   expensive and worse repealing Obamacare   she's just being locked up daddy right   now but she's done what she's done Jenna   be ashamed of herself and you know what   our government ought to be ashamed of   itself for allowing it to happen   repealing Obamacare and stopping   Hillary's healthcare takeovers one of   the single most important reasons we   must win on november eighth we have the   power in our hands in just 14 days 14   days can you believe this I started it   was a year and a half now we're down to   14 days well unbelievably tough nasty   primers we're proud to say they were the   most difficult and toughest primer as   they say in the history of politics so   we end up and now we have a nasty nasty   election but we have the facts on our   side we're going to bring back jobs   we're going to get rid of Obamacare we   have so many facts that we're going to   cut your taxes she's going to raise your   taxes we're going to cut your taxes   we're going to save Social Security   she's going to cut your Social Security   she's going to cut your Social Security   and your Medicare we have the power to   deliver justice for every American who   has been victimized by rising crime and   for every worker whose job has been   shipped to another country and for every   child trapped in a failing failing   horrible government school we had the   power to rebuild the inner cities   betrayed by Hillary Clinton and the   Democrats in Washington   african-american community has been   betrayed they've been betrayed and we're   going to get tremendous african-american   votes and we're going to get tremendous   Hispanic votes these communities have   been betrayed we have a chance to   deliver justice for every taxpayer tired   of watching their money being wasted in   Washington and for every single look   look you know the story every single   voter every single voter what has   happened to our country who wants to fix   a rigged system that takes your jobs   takes your freedom and take your voice   away from you but together we will   defeat the rigged system and the corrupt   media there is nothing more corrupt than   those people not all of them   [Music]   they are a corrupt group I'll tell you   what I went to the last rally we had   thousands and thousands of people and I   was watching one of these terrible   peoples here and I was watching and   they're saying while the crowd isn't   expected to be big we had an airport   hangar that they couldn't use because it   was a massive hanger but the crowd was   so much bigger we just moved him out   into the runways we had some crowd and   look at this and we always have and by   the way all over the country we have and   you see what's going on you see what's   happening at the voting booth you see   what's happening the lines are three   blocks long I can't tell you exactly but   I see a lot of Trump buttons a lot of   Trump hats a lot of shirts and we have a   feeling don't we that they're going to   be voting for Trump I have a feeling and   I have to tell you we didn't need to do   this I didn't need to do this I was on   the other side you know we took I took   about the other side who knows the other   side better than me I was on the other   side I also knew because I saw what was   happening I love our country I love this   country and I had no choice and I jump   so I was an insider and the day I   announced boy did I become an outside of   Wow amazing I became an outsider and I   love it because we're leading a movement   the likes of which has never ever been   seen in this country there's never been   a moment like this even the pundits that   hate me they say there has never been an   event like this in the history of our   country and we have to close it out on   november eighth and in your case florida   you can go tomorrow and do you thin but   you have to close it out otherwise to me   it's a waste of time energy money   thank you did I tell the story about one   of the pundits not a good guy but that's   okay he said it doesn't matter whether   you want to lose what you've done has   never been done in politics has never   been anything like this he said it   doesn't matter I said wait a minute wait   a minute it totally matters and I said   if I don't win it will be a great waste   seriously of time energy and money just   a waste just a waste so November rain we   have to win it's one of the great   movements of all time let's close it out   let's knock out crooked Hillary Clinton   crooked is a three-dollar bill she is as   crooked as a three-dollar bill real   James begins with ridding Washington of   corruption Hillary Clinton bleached and   deleted thirty-three thousand emails   lied to Congress under oath made 13   phones disappear some with a hammer and   then told the FBI she couldn't remember   39 separate times she couldn't remember   you know memories a little bit all   we've also just learned that one of the   closest people to crooked Hillary with   long-standing ties to her and her   husband gay listen to this one folks you   know we wonder how did she get away with   this crime when a four-star general   james Cartwright four-star one of the   most respected men in the military lied   to the FBI once he said he did it for   national security purposes that I could   understand that he lied one time to the   FBI and now they're going to put him in   prison perhaps for five years just   happened yesterday so listen to this   some gave essentially it's Hillary   because the closest person in the world   to hillary and bill is this person they   gave more than six hundred and seventy   five thousand dollars to the campaign of   the wife of the top official in the FBI   who oversaw the investigation into   crooked Hillary's illegal email server   so think of this no no think this is you   couldn't do a movie like this nobody   would believe it would not people so the   FBI is investment I have such great   respect for the people the FBI they must   be going crazy watching what's happening   at the top they must be good these are   great people so think of this so the   head of the FBI who's investigating her   has a wife who wants to run for some   office and they give her not a thousand   not two thousand not twenty thirty six   hundred and seventy five thousand   dollars that's big money that's big   money that's big money which was a big   percentage of the money she risked   675,000 else to run for office now this   is the man that is leading the   investigation into her his wife gets six   hundred and seventy five thousand   dollars essentially from Hillary Clinton   folks what's going on here what's going   on   our country is rigged it's crooked and   it's broken I'm telling you what's going   on the criminal conduct of Hillary   Clinton threatens the foundations of our   democracy and it really does but we're   going to turn it around we're going to   turn it around we're going to turn it   around a new day begins for a mug and it   starts on November it get out involved I   proposed the contract with the American   voter that will give government back to   the people so where it's supposed to be   my contract begins with a plan to end   the rampant government corruption that's   all over the place I want everyone in   Washington to listen closely to the   message I am delivering on your behalf I   want all of the special interests who   are used to getting their way I fully   understand that to pay very close   attention I want the entire corrupt   establishment to hear and heed the words   we are all about to say if we win on   november eight we are going to   Washington DC and we are going to do   what drain the swamp it is so corrupt   so corrupt but have we ever seen   corruption like this 675,000 have we   ever seen you know I kept saying how did   she get away with this she got a   subpoena from the United States Congress   and after not before that would have   been bad but after getting the subpoena   she deleted 33,000 emails so she gets a   subpoena from this tremendously high   authority she's as honest as bad news   get rid of all the emails by the way   boxes of information and emails two   weeks ago we're also just found to be   missing you heard that right how we see   entitled to run for the office of   President and by the way this is part of   the rigged system the system's rigged   box under my contract with the American   voter we're proposing a series of ethics   reforms on day one to end government can   or right right to end government   corruption and those who violate the law   will be brought to justice there will no   longer be two sets of rules in America I   mean look at general Cartwright look at   general Petraeus's life was destroyed   for doing nothing by comparison to what   this crooked person did at the very core   of my contract is a plan to bring back   American jobs we're bringing a bat we're   going to stop the jobs from leaving our   country we're going to start making   things again in America Apple will start   building factories and plants in this   country and will make their products in   the United States instead of China   Vietnam and all sorts of other kind   [Applause]   right now we are living through the   single greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world that's what's   happening the moving to Mexico it's a   highway one lane right into Mexico they   get our jobs our factories are plants   they get our people they get everything   they get the cares i would say they get   the cash we get the drugs and we get the   unemployment not going to happen not   going to happen oh we will build the   wall don't worry about that will build a   wall will go the wall   that's not even close and by the way I   met with the President of Mexico two   months ago he was wonderful guy   wonderful guy we'll have no trouble they   can't understand how they get away you   know we have a massive trade deficit   massive with Mexico a massive k deficit   and when people say oh well they'll   never pay for the well of course they   will because they're making so much   money they make it at the border they   make it every way because the   politicians are sharper and shrewder   than our politicians you know I went to   an Ivy League school I was a good   student and you know what there's no   better word to describe it's a horrible   word to use and terrible but you know I   hate to use it but there's no better   word our leaders are stupid people   they're stupid people telling you Obama   all this guy does is campaign for   Hillary who we can't stand and if you   read what happened today with the server   back and forth that he ended up knowing   about even though he said he didn't it   just came out on Wikileaks he knew about   it and if you see now why you know I'm   trying to figure out why is he back in   her over Biden did you see where Biden   wants to take me to the back of the barn   me he wants him I'd love that I'd love   that mr. tough guy you know he's missed   a tough guy you know when he's missed a   tough guy when he's standing behind a   microphone by himself that's when he's   been he wants to bring me to the back of   the barn Oh some things in life you   could really love doing our nation has   lost and by the way if I said that   they'd say he's violent how could he   have done that how could it did you see   what happened the other day it came out   that our rallies we have the greatest   rallies to safest rallies the greatest   people is there ever a better place to   be   but we have some rallies that were rough   well we had some bad people and I'd say   there were bad people in the you know   the dishonest media would never say that   it came out that they paid thugs thugs   to go to our rallies and beat people up   and they gave them fifteen hundred   dollars a day and an iphone here's the   good news not so easy to beat our people   up they found that out it's actually a   painful experience painful experience   but they paid 1500 hours and the media   doesn't report that they didn't   apologize to me they would say Donald   Trump's rallies are out of control they   were putting people in our rallies to   beat people up policemen with bad gashes   on the head walking out your side in   Chicago walking out with blood pouring   out of the head these people were paid   to do that they should be in prison   these people and the people that   organized it that's organized violence   that's real violence and you know what   nothing would happen can you imagine if   we did it and one other thing crooked   Hillary was given the questions to a   debate right you saw that donna Brazile   got the questions and gave them to   Hillary Clinton now what Donna Brazile   did was very dishonest and she should   resign as the head of the DNC she should   resign what Donna Brazile did was very   dishonest but did anyone hear Hillary   say listen I got the questions to the   debate with Bernie Sanders I got the   questions to the debate I feel very   uncomfortable I know it's wrong maybe   I'd like not to have that particular   question would that have been nice but   she's crooked Hillary so the chances of   that happening are zero clubs are zero   and you don't hear about that did   anybody hear the story she got the I   wonder if she got the answers and the   questions to the debate I just had   because we beat her very   she was beaten and i'll tell you what   did you see her after the debate she was   exhausted she are you talking about low   energy i know some low energy people but   she's right in there our nation has lost   one third of its manufacturing since   NAFTA a deal signed by Bill Clinton and   supported strongly by Hillary Clinton   we've lost listen to this you won't even   believe this and I've said for two weeks   when i saw this number it's a type of   it's got to be a type of we have lost as   a country seventy thousand factories   since china entered the World Trade   Organization a bill and hillary back   disaster seven listen folks seventy   thousand factories you wouldn't think   that's even possible I thought it was   7,000 or 700 I said you made a mistake   it's 70,000 under my contract we will   immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA   and if we don't get the deal we want we   will terminate NAFTA and get a much   better deal for our workers and our   company it's going to be America first   the next disaster on the horizon is the   trans-pacific partnership a nearly 6,000   page document that will drain our jobs   and our freedoms it will be another   disaster you cannot let it happen if I'm   president it's not happening folks and   we're gonna have a lot of trade but   we're not going to make these many multi   nations it we're gonna have one on one   on one on one we're going to have   straight lines going right into   different countries and you know what if   they misbehave if they do something bad   it's called a 30-day notice of   cancellation and you know what during   that 30 days they'll come back and we'll   make a better deal a trump   administration will stop the   trans-pacific partnership Hillary   Clinton called the TPP the gold standard   and would approve one hundred percent of   it now during the debate she said she   never called that the goal   right but she lied she lied and during   the debate when I said line in the sand   right the red line that are great   president said draw the line in the sand   right well she said she wasn't Secretary   of State she lied she was she was that   came up in the next debate by the way   you lied about this oh I'm sorry I   didn't mean that she doesn't mean we   won't let it happen because we will win   a november eighth and we will protect   every last american and every last   american job if we don't stop the TPP we   will lose our economic independence for   good it's a big big problem that's   what's at stake in this election this   election has so many things going number   one more taxes less regulation and we   get rid of obamacare and we come up with   a plan that's so much less expensive   so what we're going to do are a few   things the tax reduction will give a   middle-class family with two children a   basic break of thirty-five percent   families will be able to fully deduct   the cost of child care for their taxes   we will lower taxes on our businesses   from thirty-five percent all the way   down to fifteen percent we will become a   jobs generating machine we will be so   proud of our country again we're not   going to lose our businesses and if they   decide to go and they want to make their   air conditioning unit they want to make   their car they want to send it through   the border which now will become a very   strong border guess what folks   thirty-five percent tax they're never   going to leave they're never going to   leave we will be a rich nation again but   to be a rich country we must also be a   safe country that's why my contract   includes major investments in federal   law enforcement efforts to dismantle   criminal networks preying on our   citizens and that's what they're doing I   will also keep us safe from radical   Islamic right radical Islamic terrorists   radical Islamic terrorists Hillary   Clinton unleashed Isis and unleash death   and suffering across the Middle East and   spreading into our country we are taking   thousands and thousands of people from   Syria we have no idea where they come   from we have no idea who they are   they're not properly vetted you will see   over the years what a mistake that is   you will see she wants to now increase   the high number already were taken in   thousands tens of thousands she wants to   increase that number by five hundred and   fifty percent you put her in as   president   you're crazy now she wants in her words   totally open borders there goes your   country hey guys you can't take which   includes an open border with the Middle   East she wants to allow people to pour   in the Hillary plan would transform our   country and leave us with generations of   terrorism inside our shores a trump   administration is going to suspend   immigration from terror prone regions   and will suspend the Syrian refugee   program immediately we have no choice we   have no choice let me state this as   clearly as I can if I'm elected   president I am going to keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of our   country we have enough problems we have   enough problem   i will also secure defend the borders of   the united states

Trump this thing you could have sold   it out three different times so that's   great could we do a little shorter   version so you can go home and watch   football no I love you too I don't know   if you know the NFL is way down in their   ratings and you know why two reasons   number one is this politics they're   finding is a much rougher game than   football and more exciting and this   honestly we've taken a lot of people   away from the NFL and the other reason   is Kaepernick Kaepernick   and that's fine but elect me and we will   stop the horrible hikes that you sing   with Obamacare we will stop the   Obamacare madness ninety percent of   colorado counties are losing insurers   next year as a result of obamacare some   of you can have one person one group to   deal with that's not good good luck in   the negotiation in Minnesota where the   premium increase will be close to sixty   percent the Democratic governor has said   the Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable Hillary Clinton wants to   double down on Obamacare make it an even   more expensive in fact much more   expensive she also wants to raise your   taxes through the roof by the way lot's   of luck like like taxes aren't high   enough for the people of this country   I'm asking for your vote so we can   replace Obamacare and save health care   for every family in Colorado and in the   country and in the country real change   also means restoring honesty to our   government my contract with the American   voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption our plan our plan   includes a constitutional amendment to   impose term limits on all members of   Congress   i will impose a lifetime ban on foreign   lobbyists raising money for American   like I don't want to have them raising   one who knew they could even do that   then you wonder why we're making bad   deal with you know we make all these   horrible deals with other countries   people say I wonder why well take a look   at that so we will impose a ban   permanent ban on that I want the entire   corrupt Washington establishment to hear   and to heed our words okay our words our   when we win on November a we are going   to Washington DC and we are going to   drain the swamp yeah yeah   we all know about Hillary's mounting   legal troubles that she's brought onto   herself with her willful and deliberate   criminal misconduct Hillary Clinton is   not the victim by the way she's not the   victim you the American people of the   victims of this corrupt system in every   way and this is your last chance to   change it I really believe this this is   your last election where you're going to   have a chance and if we don't win   between Supreme Court justices and all   of the other things that are going to be   so important it will be very very sad   very very sad I honestly believe and I   think most of the people in this room   believe that this will be your last   chance to win and not going to happen   again and by the way we're leading in so   many polls we're leading by four points   in Florida   of all people the New York Times just   put us at four points up in Florida and   that's low they have lines in Florida   early voting that are stretching four   and five blocks they never had lines   before people walk in they vote we're   leading in Iowa we're leading we're   leading in North Carolina we're leading   in the great state of Ohio big league   we're leaving all over the place and   we're leading numerous national polls   and those polls are all before the   bombshell of corruption that was   additionally exposed or exposed for a   second time on friday so this was all   this was all before the big bombshell   these Falls came out so I don't know   what that's going to mean I can tell you   I wouldn't be voting for we could speak   for days for weeks months about   Hillary's many crimes against his   country and its people and her efforts   to conceal those crimes by destroying   [Music]   33,000 emails   [Applause]   do you know i'll be honest i think that   washington DC sees these rallies we have   the biggest ever it's one of the great   movements of all time even the very   dishonest me do the world's most   dishonest people they say it they say it   it's considered one of the great   political phenomenon and i will tell you   but to me if we don't get there if we   don't win in november if i don't   consider it a couple of them have said   doesn't matter what you've done will go   down in the history books i said maybe   for you not for me I've spent tremendous   hours and energy and tremendous amounts   of money as you know I think I'll be in   for could be over a hundred million   dollars   colors which is nice because that's a   hundred million we don't collect from   donors and special interest where we   have had we've had tremendous support   but where we have had the best support   in all fairness is the small donor the   61 dollar I think it averages something   like 61 dollars no Republican has ever   been able to do that but to me it's an   honor now I'll tell you if we lose I   will say it was the greatest waste of   time energy and money of my lifetime   okay forget forget going down in the   history book we're gonna win I think   we're gonna win and I think I think when   you read when you read WikiLeaks be that   Podesta I'll tell you what I would fire   him so fast he speaks so badly about her   she's got bad instincts she oh I won't   even say it he says things about her   that I won't say about her do you   believe it I would fire John Podesta so   fast whoever he is i don't think i ever   met the guy but he says such bad things   about her and others say such bad things   it's amazing what you learned from from   looking i'll tell you what if she never   heard the word email do you think she'd   be a very happy woman today now it was   just learned by the way that they found   six hundred and fifty thousand emails on   the current investigation of somebody   else   you know in the diamond business and the   coal business called don't worry we're   putting your miners back to work clean   coal Plinko they call this could be the   mother lode you know this could be the   33,000 that are missing this could be   the 20,000 that are missing this could   be the 15,000 that are missing three   weeks ago they're missing a big box of   emails thank you for 650,000 what do you   have to do to do 650 just if you SAT and   did like this one two three you'd be   there for weeks how can you have 650,000   emails anyway they have 650,000 that   they found was just reported I would   think they have some real bad ones but   we're going to find out look hey maybe   not maybe not no doubt in the next nine   days hilary and her special interest   will say and do something to detract   from her crime into district and also to   distract from the issues facing our   country as the obama campaign once said   Hillary will say anything and change   nothing now you know who said that about   her right as President Obama and you   remember you know what she's supposed to   be oh it's everything so nice to hugging   and they're kissing and and by the way   President Obama should not be focused on   Hillary Clinton getting elected he   should be focused on bringing your jobs   back on beating Isis   I'm so fast but somebody   said something today that was very   interested they said you know he made   that statement I'd like to take him to I   wish he talked that way to Isis right   I'd like to take him to the back of the   gym and somebody said that you know the   announces these crooked people back here   at disgusting though they were all   saying oh what a wonderful statement Oh   was so wonderful the way he said that oh   isn't that great now if I would have   said I'd like to take Biden to the back   of the gym they'd say he's a bully he's   a mean mean horrible man right he's a   horrible man but with Biden I thought it   was so nice one person even said that   was so cute oh boy folks we better win   on november eighth we better way got to   get rid of the screw you know Hillary   said that she was going to make him   Secretary of State now he turned it down   he's the guys exhausted but he's almost   as tired as she is but not quite but she   said who's gonna be secretary of state   so they called do you have a comment I   said yeah these are the guys that have   been raising taxes these are the guys   that came up with Obamacare these are   the guys that can't be dices these are   the guys that letting drugs pour into   our country we have no borders we have   no anything murder rate is the highest   it's been in 45 years who the hell wants   him as Secretary of State these people   are there we want to have fresh strong   smart tough people but people with heart   we want people with heart   you   in and I will continue to address and   expose the criminal corruption of   Hillary Clinton and a threat to the   survival of our democracy but i also   want to spend these next nine days with   the wonderful people of this country   talking about my vision for making   America great again and let's talk   positive let's talk possible I'm   starting to think we'll go positive   because you know it's all you know bad   borders our militaries depleted   everything let's talk about fixing our   military fixing our border we're going   to talk pause at the core of my contract   is my plan to bring back jobs right now   70 million American women and children   live in poverty or near the brink of   poverty forty-three percent of   african-american school-age children   live in poverty thirty-four percent of   Hispanic school age children live in   poverty there are 40,000 homeless   veterans are great people do we have any   veterans in the audience yeah a lot   forty thousand homeless yet we spend   hundreds of billions of dollars   providing benefits to illegal immigrants   we take care in many cases of illegal   immigrants more so that we take care of   our great veterans that let us be here   we have a story there was a story over   the weekend you probably saw it a   veteran he lives out of a dumpster he   gets his food from a dumpster and he was   a great veteran a brave veteran and he   lives out of a dumpster we're not going   to have that folks we're not gonna   happen   and Hillary Clinton said the veterans   administration is doing just fine it's   not people are waiting in line for two   weeks before they could even people are   dying waiting online for a simple   prescription or procedure it's terrible   so we're going to take care of our   veterans and the veterans know it and we   are overwhelming they do polls of the   veterans we are overwhelming and we're   gonna follow through unlike these   politicians for so many Hillary's   refugee plan would cost 400 billion   dollars that's enough to rebuild the   inner cities of America it's time to put   America first as your president I will   go into the poorest communities and work   on a national plan for revitalization we   will replace decades of failure with   generations of success we will bring   prosperity to our poorest communities   and neighborhoods safety to our most   dangerous areas and hope to those places   which have not known hope in a very very   long time   and to the african-american community   that lives so many in these innocent   freaking American community we're going   to help that lives so many in these   inner cities we're going to help it's   unsafe you can't walk to the store and   get a loaf of bread you get shot it's   unsafe the education is no good and   there are no jobs and I always say it I   say give me a chance what do you have to   lose give me a chance the Democrats have   been running this thing for up to a   hundred years an interrupted and all   they do is they want your vote they want   your vote and then they'll say thanks a   lot see you in four years they don't do   a damn thing so to the African Americans   out there that are watching on   television and in the room I say give me   a chance I will not disappoint you   America has laws thank you one third of   its manufacturing jobs since bill   clinton signed nafta   by the way the worst trade bill ever   signed in history America has lost   listen to this seventy thousand   factories since China entered the world   trade organization under the Bill and   Hillary backed disaster Colorado lost   more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs   since Clinton's NAFTA and China's trade   deals went into effect we're living   through the single greatest jobs theft   in the history of the world what the   world has done to us because of stupid   corrupt politicians what the world has   done to us a trump administration will   stop another disaster which will come   about if I'm not president the   trans-pacific partnership renegotiate   NAFTA we have to and we are going to   stand up to China on its currency   manipulation and I've done so much   business with China we're going to be   fine with China problem with China they   have no respect for our country they   have no respect for our president   they'll respect us again the meantime   they're building a massive fortress in   the middle of the South China Sea so   they take our money they take our jobs   they make everything for us we bring it   in no tax no nothing and yet it's almost   impossible for us to do business over   there I don't know if you know it's not   a it's not a tool it's guy this big guy   with the cowboy hat right nah big   good-looking guy and I like him you know   why he's a serious supporter right my   guy but it's like a one-way street   whether it's China Mexico it's just boom   everything goes and they get everything   we get nothing we get unemployment we   get close factors it's good to stop and   it's so easy it's so easy because your   politicians have never told you what to   do when they leave and they fire   everybody and they go to let's say   Mexico they make their air conditioners   or their cars or whatever they make and   we charge them now   nothing so they make them they send them   but we have unemployment than closed   factories now when I tell them before   they leave listen folks please don't   leave they'll say no sir we're leaving   say well here's the story you leave you   want to play cool so you go ahead and   leave enjoy your factory in Mexico it's   a little hot but that's okay don't worry   you'll get used to it but every time you   make an air conditioning unit carrier   who left Indianapolis every time you   make an air conditioning unit and you   think you're going to sell it into our   country tax-free not going to happen   anymore no no thirty-five percent tax   thirty-five percent tax and you know   what's going to happen when they hear   that they're not leaving folks and for   the few companies that might want to   take a chance it's okay we're gonna make   a lot of money okay it's okay do you   agree with that right you know how many   companies we've lost we're losing all   these stuff as we're standing here today   you have people the leaders of your   company's negotiating to leave Colorado   and to leave Ohio and to leave   Pennsylvania North Carolina and Wyoming   or does Wyoming Wyoming is going to love   me they love a thing called clean call   in Wyoming what Wyoming great place tell   your friends in Wyoming the miners go   back to work okay will you do that all   right tell her the miners are going back   to work in Wyoming and in West Virginia   and in Ohio and by the way the   steelworkers too we're going to lower   taxes on American business from   thirty-five percent to fifteen percent   we're going to cut taxes for the middle   class families by hundreds of billions   of dollars a year middle-class families   have been hurt so badly like the   Forgotten people they like the Forgotten   people not anymore and we'll end the war   on American energy Hillary Clinton is   said   by the time we get through all of my   conditions I do not think there will be   any places in America where fracking   will continue to take place   I mean fracking is actually not as new   as people think but essentially it's a   new technology and it's had an   unbelievable impact and we have under   our feet so much wealth don't forget we   have 20 trillion dollars got to pay it   off and we have so much wealth and we   want and you know environmentally I've   received many environmental rewards but   I want crystal clear crystal clean water   right I want such clean air i want that   air to be clean and i want safety other   than that folks that's what I walk we   want water we want air and we want   safety you see this new this new pack   that Obama made where we're paying   billions and billions and billions of   dollars and I don't think they have any   idea where it's even go at Lobo worming   pet and all it does is make it   impossible for our businesses to compete   so we'll make a couple of little changes   when we get in Hillary Clinton also   wants to put your miners out of work my   administration will put the miners back   to work and we will unleash the power of   clean coal oil natural gas and shale   energy we will become a rich nation once   again but to be rich nation we must also   be a safe nation hillary wants a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees over and above the   thousands that are already coming in   under Obama   when I'm elected president we will   suspend the Syrian refugee program and   we will keep radical Islamic terrorists   the hell out of our country sorry sorry   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and yes we will build a wall and   yes Mexico will pay for the world I will   pay for them crooked Hillary has pledged   open borders which means there goes your   country and she supports sanctuary says   no longer folks but she wants open   borders you saw that during the debate   WikiLeaks got her again she never talked   open borders that's open borders we   could have 600 million people pour into   our country think of it once you have   open borders like that you don't have a   country anymore countless Americans are   killed by illegal immigrants because our   government won't do its job here in   Colorado detective who you know Donna   young and detective John Bishop were   providing security at a baptism when   they were ambushed by an illegal   immigrant who had multiple prior run-ins   with law enforcement a very bad actor   the illegal immigrant shot and killed   detective young and wounded detective   bishop the perpetrator was a known gang   member and a person that people that   knew him begged begged get him out of   our country or incarcerate him but it   was too late also here in Colorado   Patricia   Tricia Gunther oh and Deborah's erected   along with a small toddler were killed   by an illegal immigrant who had been   arrested 16 times by seven different   police departments throughout the state   of Colorado when I become president this   crime wave will end and it will end very   quickly you ought to go take a look at   the remembrance project these are people   whose children and sisters and brothers   everybody I'm just so sad to see I've   gotten very friendly with a lot of them   they're unbelievable in the most cases   parents where young young children were   killed so many of them so many of them   we will end illegal immigration too poor   to all criminal illegal immigrants and   save American lives he was 70 under   Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary   of State when they caught an illegal   criminal illegal criminal could be a   murderer could be a drug pusher could be   a bad gang member they would bring them   back to their country and their country   very smart would say we don't want them   don't we're not taken aback so that   bring them back into the United States   because they call her and that's a   meaning her people bring them back bring   her back we don't want so then now all   over our country I guarantee you whether   it's four years or eight years that   won't happen one time when we bring them   back they take   also repeal the obama-clinton defense   sequester and rebuild our badly depleted   military in addition to general Flynn we   have the endorsements how good is   general fitness ago we have the   endorsements of over 200 Admirals and   Generals and 22 medal of honor   recipients great people gotten to know a   lot of our Air Force is the smallest and   oldest that has ever been the smallest   and oldest we will rebuild our Air Force   with new modern planes and we will also   invest in the space technology and   crucial work being done at Buckley Air   Force Base will step it up we also need   a new foreign policy that puts America   for us to finally Hillary brought   disaster to Iraq Syria Libya she   empowered Iran and she unleashed Isis in   the vacuum in the vacuum Hillary failed   our Washington I mean if you take a look   our Washington establishment is fail   they've six trillion dollars on wars in   the Middle East and now the Middle East   as far as we're concerned and as far as   humanity is concerned is is it's in far   worse shape than it's ever been you go   back 15 years ago there was nothing like   this so we spent six trillion dollars we   could have rebuilt our country two or   three times over and the Middle East is   in far worse shape and far more   dangerous we have the great migration   all of the problems look at what's   happening to Germany look at what's   happening to France Paris nice six   trillion dollars in were in much worse   shape think of it could have rebuilt our   country they dragged us into foreign   wars that have made us less safe and   that we don't win they have left our   borders wide open at home and they've   shipped our jobs and wealth of other   countries to all Americans I say it is   time now finally for new leadership   [Applause]   Hilary wants to raise your taxes to   almost fifty percent I'm lowering your   taxes big league my contract calls for   the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan   Hilary opposed to school choice and   wants federal bureaucrats to make   education choices instead of parents my   contract guarantees school choice and   puts a rapid end to common core we're   bringing our education look Hillary   Clinton oversaw massive cuts to the   military budget and said the problems at   the VA are not widespread 22 suicides a   day nobody even believes that number 22   there were two numbers I couldn't   believe when i hear seventy thousand   factories gone I never doesn't sound   like it's about 70,000 and the other one   I can't believe 22 suicides a day events   and a lot of that is because of lack of   service lack of whatever it takes lack   of care lack of care my contract   reverses the defense cuts rebuilds our   military when we need it almost as badly   as ever before and gives veterans the   right to see the doctor of their choice   Hillary Clinton attacks the integrity of   police officers she attacks the   integrity of police oh my contract calls   for funding training and supporting the   incredible men and women of law   enforcement   Hillary Clinton wants to release more   violent offenders from prison and   frankly from other countries as they   illegally end my contract calls for a   national plan to reduce violent crime   and treats safety as a civil right our   murder rate is the highest it's been in   45 years hillary wants to effectively   abolish the Second Amendment I was   endorsed oh that's right that's right   the response in Colorado that's a bigger   response that I usually get that's a big   respond so i got i got the earliest   endorsement ever from the National Rifle   Association BR we're going to save you   second to them we are going to save you   Second Amendment you'd have to worry   about it my contract calls for saving   the Second Amendment and protecting the   right to keep and bear arms very   important hillary wants immediate   amnesty open borders and virtually   unlimited immigration from the most   dangerous regions in the world my plan   ends illegal immigration and suspends   immigration from terror prone regions   now I have to tell you we're going to   have the wall we need it we're going to   have the strong border but we're going   to have big beautiful doors in the wall   and people are going to come into our   country and they're going to be proud to   come in and they're going to come in on   merit we're going to also take people on   merit   people that can help us grow the country   great people but I just want to let you   know people will enter and come in to   our country people that you'll love and   people that will love you but they will   come in to our country legally okay and   we're going to speed up the process   we're going to very very strongly speed   up the process because it's forever and   it's very unfair you know when you have   people that are in line for ten years   can't get in and then you have somebody   crosses the border and you're supposed   to do that who's that oh you know what   I'm talking about father right I love   father what is your name for the father   Andrei does anyone know father run dr   heard about father uncle thank you   Father under so we want to speed up that   process and make it a fair process   hillary wants radical judges who will   impose their personal opinions from the   bench my contract calls for the   appointment of judges who uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   States   and those are your federal judges but   justice is also of the Supreme Court of   the United States great great people   within a point and great intellect   Hilary wants to go even further than   Obama on illegal executive actions I   will terminate every single illegal   Obama executive order and will restore   the constitutional law I will restore   the constitutional law to this country   finally Hilary wants us to think small   wants us to believe things can change   and once our lives to revolve around   Washington DC I am asking you to dream   big to push for bold change and to   believe in a movement powered by the   people and by their love of our country   thank you   thank you is there any place better to   be than a trump rally in offering no   play and even with your broncos playing   this is really good and John Elway's a   very good guy by the way I played golf   with John Elway quite a while ago I want   to tell you something in case you did   what oh it's a mosquito II I never like   mosquitoes I like him even less now but   I played golf with john elway and i will   tell you something you will not be   surprised that he hits the hell out of   the ball he is long he's got a thing   called club head speed but who would be   surprised at that but he's a great guy   he's done a great job I've been very   lucky I've led a great life now I want   to give back to the country which has   been so good to me   I've spent a career finding the untapped   potential in projects and in people   everywhere I look in this country all i   see is untapped potential waiting to be   set free I'm tired of politicians   telling Americans to defer their dreams   to another day when they really mean to   another decade America is tired of   waiting the moment is now it's not going   to happen again all we have to do is   stop believing in our farold politicians   and start believing in each other and in   our country which is so amazing there is   no challenge too great no dream outside   of our reach don't let anyone tell you   it can't be done it can and I know it so   well and don't forget I spent my life on   the other side I was an insider I was   maybe the ultimate inside I know them I   understand the game but I also looked   across and I said our country is dying   we can continue to lose almost 800   billion dollars Iran bad trade deals   that are there because of political   interests because of donors and special   interests because of campaign   contributions they don't care about the   country but we can't continue to make   deals like that horrible Iran deal where   we give them a hundred and fifty billion   dollars back   or where we give them 1.7 billion   dollars in cash in cash and then they   humiliate us by taking our 10 sailors   and all sorts and they would have kept   him except that the money started   pouring in two days later so I saw what   was happening and I said I love our   country too much not that this is easy I   could be home very much enjoying   watching the denver game i could be very   much enjoying myself sitting in New York   or Florida or wherever I'm sitting   watching the denver game right as an   example but we had to do this and again   i say it once more it there has never   been in this country bill o'reilly smart   guy tough guy he said the single   greatest political phenomena because   he's witnessed in his lifetime we don't   want to blow it in november eighth we   don't want to blow up get out of work   the future lies with the dreamers not   the cynics and the critics hilary has   been there for 30 years and she has   accomplished nothing she's just made   things worse she's the candidate of   yesterday we're the movement of the   future we

leader is going to be Donald Trump thank   you yeah when you you know when you see   Americans like this I mean and you think   about all of the men and women who serve   our country sort of on the fun of   frontiers of where they're sent for   reasons what that they don't totally   understand and to do things that they   may not necessarily agree with what they   do it because they love this country   just like you love this country and   that's again back to my original point   this election is so important if this is   about the heart and soul and the   direction of this country so make sure   on the 8th of November you get out there   and you vote for Donald Trump and I know   he's going to remind you to do that so   without without further ado ladies and   gentlemen I want to

amazing men   and I want to thank them for being with   us you know pueblos called home of the   heroes did you know that because of your   proud tradition of military service   pueblos the home of four medal of honor   recipients and I just got the   endorsement of 19 altogether 19 so when   you have 19 that's pretty good but you   have four which is amazing and as   President Eisenhower said there must be   something in the water out here in   Playboy because all of you guys turn out   to be heroes what's going on what's   going on there's something in the water   give me some of that water Colorado is   home to six military bases we're going   to eliminate the defense sequester and   rebuild our military we're going to   strengthen it we're going to make it   truly truly strong again another great   Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing   [Applause]   my son's know that very well they hear   all but that we're going to conserve   your land for the future generations and   we're going to save your second   Amendment which is under siege   a lot of people in this room this is   very impressive thank you thank you it's   great honor it's a great honor one other   issue of such great importance in   Colorado is energy crooked Hillary   Clinton wants to shut down the mines and   shut down jail and shut down oil and   natural gas and we're going to end the   war in American energy and we are going   to put the miners back to work they have   to be put back to you I've also made a   centerpiece of my economic   revitalization plan the largest middle   class tax cut since Ronald Reagan and   the largest regulatory reform in   American history we're going to do that   and Hillary Clinton is going to increase   your taxes very very substantially and   she admits it police she admits it but   that's because I know how overtaxed and   over-regulated the working people and   companies in this country are a central   issue I would like to address today is   our broken tax code an issue of concern   to all Americans along with securing our   borders rebuilding our military keeping   us safe from terrorism redoing our trade   deals and bringing back jobs and they're   sort of one of the same   [Applause]   fixing our broken tax code is one of the   main reasons i'm running for president   i've been saying from the beginning of   this campaign how ridiculous complex and   yes unfair the tax system is it is an   unfair system and so complex that very   few people understand it fortunately i   understand it   [Applause]   this is not the fault of the IRS but the   political class that is owned outright   by the special interests and lobbyists   believe me it's these politicians who   wrote the tax code and who are   constantly adding revising and changing   and already over complicated set of laws   all at the behest of their favorite   donors and special interests who want   certain provisions put in and they won't   take no for an answer it's thousands of   pages long and almost no one understands   it the average American would need an   army of accountants and lawyers to wade   through and wade through it many   so-called experts due to their sheer   size and complexity of the code don't   have a clue what these pages represent   these are experts they get paid and they   don't even know what it represents the   unfairness of the tax laws is   unbelievable it's something I've been   talking about for a long time despite   frankly being a big beneficiary of the   laws but I'm working for you now I'm not   working for Trump   believe me   [Applause]   I understand the tax laws better than   almost anyone which is why I am one who   can truly fix them I understand it I get   it and that is what I commit to do we   want fairness we want money brought in   and we want money to be spent when it   goes out because they spent our tax   dollars so unfairly and unwisely   remember that as a businessman and real   estate developer I have legally used a   tax laws to my benefit add to the   benefit of my company my investors and   my employees I mean honestly I have   brilliantly I have brilliantly used   those laws I have often said or the   campaign trail that I have a fiduciary   responsibility to pay no more tax than   is legally required like anybody else or   but another way to pay as little tax as   legally possible and I must tell you I   hate the way they spend our tax dollars   [Applause]   and believe me that makes a difference   as a major real estate developer in this   country and throughout the world I faced   enormous taxes city taxes state taxes   sales taxes excise taxes employee taxes   federal taxes vat taxes different   countries it's my job to minimize the   overall tax burden to the greatest   extent possible which allows me to   reinvest in neighborhoods in workers and   build amazing properties which feel   tremendous growth in their communities   and always help our great providers of   jobs and we have to help our small   businesses what it's all about what it's   all about   the news media is now obsessed with an   alleged tax filing from the 1990s at the   end of one of the most brutal economic   downturns in our country's history if   you remember the early 90s other than i   would say 1928 there was nothing even   close the conditions facing real estate   developers in that early 90 period were   almost as bad as the Great Depression of   1929 and far worse than the Great   Recession of 2008 not even close what   had been a booming economy in the era of   Ronald Reagan changed dramatically and   the business landscape changed with it   bank failures and collapse the absolute   total destruction of the Savings and   Loan industry and the implosion of the   retail market and real estate in general   something we've never seen anything like   it many business people including many   of my competitors and some of my friends   were not able to survive company's jobs   and opportunities were lost and lives   were destroyed as tens of thousands of   people were put out of work some of the   biggest and strongest people and   companies went absolutely bankrupt which   I never did by the way are you proud of   me   [Applause]   would have loved to use that card but I   just didn't want to do it thank you yet   today my company is bigger stronger far   greater assets and it's ever had before   more premium properties we've never done   better it's the strongest we've ever   been and we employ thousands of people   and over the years have employed   thousands and thousands of people which   is the thing that frankly makes me most   happy that did not happen by chance or   luck it happened by action and talent   lot of talent I was able to use the tax   laws of this country and my business   acumen to dig out of the real estate   mess you would call it a depression when   few others were able to do what I did in   those most if I'm a star thank you you   are too   oh they were amazing times in those most   difficult times when so many had their   backs to the wall I reached within   myself and delivered for my company my   employees my family and the communities   where my properties existed and I really   delivered those who spend their entire   lives within the confines of government   work and who know virtually nothing of   business fail to understand the skill   dedication this year grid it takes for a   company to climb out of an economic   depression of the scale we had in the   early 90s   [Applause]   people like my opponent Hillary Clinton   whose only   [Applause]   folks let's win on november eighth okay   [Applause]   anyway our only method of making money   is by selling government favors and   granting access to special interests   know nothing about how businesses   succeed and grow Hillary Clinton has   never created a single job in her entire   life by the way we have somebody who has   Wiz Bernie Marcus where's Bernie Bernie   Marcus founder of home depot go to home   depot he only created about hundreds of   thousands how many jobs is Home Depot   produced right now Bernie how much   millions millions Bernie that's a lot of   jobs a great guy a great man an   unbelievable entrepreneuring somebody   that put a lot of people to work and   home depot is a terrific company and   thank you for being here Bernie   appreciate it thank you they haven't   added a single dollar of value people   like Hillary to the American economy   Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest   dollar in her entire life all she does   is takes from you takes from your   country and pedals influence to donors   special interests and foreign actors for   astronomical dollars like you've never   seen before its corruption of the   highest order you know it I know it she   knows it and plenty of other people know   it but they're not doing anything about   it well I made my money as a very   successful private business person   following the law all the way Hillary   Clinton made her money as a corrupt   public official breaking the law and   putting her government office up for   sale and now she's running for president   by her own account Hillary Clinton left   the White House dead broke she said dead   bro and then remember she became a   senator for New York did nothing   remember the job she was going to   produce you never produce him and then   she became Secretary of State and now   she and her husband have made more than   200 million dollars without building a   company or creating a single thing of   value during the early 90s as companies   went absolutely bus they were collapsing   all over the place left and right the   media and powers-that-be said Donald   Trump he could never ever make it back   oh I remember those stories we were all   and so how many people then were in   trouble like everybody was in trouble   but they said and they were so gleeful   he could never make it back they said I   had billions of dollars in borrowing   which is true and hundreds of millions   dollars in personal guarantees which is   true and no pathway out which is false   that was a bad time that was an ugly   time a lot of people you'll never hear   from him again from that period but I   never had any doubts whatsoever and most   importantly I never ever gave up or even   thought about giving up   that's because I knew in my heart that   when the chips are down is when I   perform the very best that is always   when I perform the best just want to   make my best decisions judgments   remember Bernie saying Hillary Clinton   has bad judgment and honestly my single   greatest asset probably is temperament   because if you didn't have the right   temperament you could have never escaped   that financial jungle that's for sure   single greatest asset is my temperament   and I have a temperament for winning you   have to win we have a temperament all of   us for winning   and when people make the mistake of   underestimating me that's when they are   really in for their biggest surprise   same thing with a lot of the people in   this room just look at what happened in   the primary remember the primary Trump's   running oh don't worry about it he's the   star of The Apprentice he built a nice   company don't worry just look at what   happened our incredible movement is   doing just take a look this is a   movement folks a movement like they've   never seen what we've done is amazing   and now we have one person left crooked   Hillary and we have to beat her on   november eighth and you have to get out   and vote and you have to get out and   make calls that you have to do and   jokingly i like to say if you sick if   you get the absolute worst prognosis   from the doctor and it looks like maybe   you're not even going to make it it   doesn't make a damn bit of difference   get up and vote or november   but the reason I never felt in dangers   really and I never did I never felt   endangered during the real estate   downturn I guess I didn't read the   stories was that I knew myself I knew my   business I knew the financial system I   knew the tax code and most importantly I   knew how to fight because that's what   you had to do that was fight and that's   what I am I'm a fighter and I'm now   going to fight for you I'm not fighting   for me anymore I'm fighting for you   fighting for you   with my knowledge I knew that I would   make a comeback without question I never   had a doubt in my mind and again I don't   know i don't even think of it as a   comeback it was just like you know we   had tough periods good period stuff   periods we just knew that things were   going to be just fine but that is why   I'm here today thank you doing and I'm   praying for you and I love you   great people now I get the whole hero   thing now I   [Applause]   but that is why I have left private   business to go into public life if you   would have ever told me that I was going   to be doing this now had I known I was   going to be doing this I would have   commenced with certain television   interviews radio interviews I would have   said things slightly differently and I   wouldn't have had as good a time in life   and as much fun in life but it would   have made my life is a politician a   little bit easier right and you know   these people holier-than-thou Nate they   never say anything around the breakfast   room table do they do they never do Bill   and Hillary never say anything like this   around the breakfast can you imagine   what they say well they talk about   deplorable Zandi redeemable right I talk   about that you're deplorable your   irredeemable I think irredeemable might   be worse if you think it everyone talks   about deplorable a these are the   greatest people in this room and many   other rooms like it we've seen hundreds   of thousands of people these are the   greatest people and really importantly   we're going to make it great for all of   the people it's not my people or people   that are voting from me we're going to   make it great for all of our people in   this country   [Applause]   but I'm doing this and I'm doing it for   a very specific reason because I   understand our country is in very very   bad shape   [Applause]   that's all right sounds like a nice   person oh oh I thought that was the   Commission on Presidential Debates i was   working i said i didn't know they were   here   you know when they were playing with the   mic back forth I thought that was the   Commission though that's a beautiful   Commission let's see what happens on   Sunday again my biggest opponent was the   microphone and now our country is in   need of a major comeback it needs one   now just about more than ever we owe 20   trillion dollars in debt doubled during   Obama's period as president double think   of it but that's only part of the story   we have over 100 trillion dollars in   unfunded liabilities and we have a   budget that's out of control with annual   deficits in addition because of the in   competence of our leaders we run massive   trade deficits on an annual basis I'll   get Bernie to negotiate a couple of   these trade deals you'll find out and we   now have almost 800 billion dollars a   year in trade deficits and you said   yourself who are these people   negotiating ideas our country is broke   broke and the worst part is that with   all of the money we spend so foolishly   all over the world stupidly all over the   world we protect other countries with   tremendous I mean tremendous losses and   we want to protect countries but they   should pay us the proper amount why   should we be losing money   [Applause]   but think of it with all of the money   that we spend and with 20 trillion   dollars in debt and all of the things we   do and all of the talk at all of the   political nonsense we have a decaying   infrastructure we are failing schools we   have rising crime we have a depleted   military are great people and a depleted   military we have planes that are so old   they go to aeroplanes graveyards to take   out parts they go to museums to take out   parts because they don't make the parts   anymore we have an open border we have   an economy that can't create full-time   high-paying jobs because our jobs are   great jobs many of them have been have   been taken and we will build the wall   don't worry we're gonna build a wall   we're going to build the wall we're   going to build the world we're going to   build a wall we're going to build a wall   Mexico's going to pay for the wall they   don't know it yet but they're going to   pay for the wrong   and you have a tremendous problem right   here but we're going to have drugs stop   pouring into our country destroying our   youth poisoning our people poisoning our   people we r divided nation and each week   it seems we're getting more and more   divided with race riots on our streets   on a monthly basis now somebody said   don't call them race rights but that's   what they are their restaurants and it's   happening more and more you looked at   Charlotte a great city where I have   property a great city you look at   different places around our country st.   Louis Ferguson Baltimore Chicago in   Chicago thousands of shootings thousands   since January first four thousand   shootings think of it since January this   is not the America that was handed down   to us and it's not the America that we   want to leave to our children   [Applause]   and it's certainly not the America we   want to pass down to our grandchildren   but this is the America we will have if   we don't turn things around starting   immediately we don't have much time   folks we don't have much time and if we   don't win this election it will never   happen again this opportunity is never   going to happen again what I say is not   lost on the American people because   seventy percent of you believe our   country is headed in the wrong direction   and I'm trying to figure out who the   other thirty percent are I want to meet   him we cannot have another four years of   Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will be   worse she will be worse   we can turn our country around but if we   don't make a change in leadership right   now it'll never happen the failed   political establishment must go it must   go for the sake of your country your   future and those you love the most   [Applause]   in the early 90s they splashed the front   pages with stories about how Donald   Trump me they said I was finished   everybody said that I was done there   were front page articles in The Wall   Street Journal in the New York Times   among many others they were thrilled and   delighted and i'm still here can you   believe these people then was speaking   they're going crazy can you believe the   Wall Street Journal the New York Times   they are going crazy they say 1990s and   now here I am still they say can we ever   get rid of this guy but they were   thrilled to write these negative stories   so they said I was finished the only   person who didn't think that I was in   trouble was a guy named Donald J Trump I   didn't think I was in problem I sort of   didn't know what they were talking about   does that make sense power of positive   thinking but I didn't know what they   were talking about I started my company   with a small loan and as I grew I   borrowed money to grow the company and   big money from big banks when the bottom   fell out of the real estate market I had   this large amount of debt and it stayed   the same but the value of assets   plummeted so they have to learn I was   young and you have to learn and I   learned and I worked really hard but I   knew how to use the tax code to rebuild   my company when others didn't I knew how   to understand and I fully understood the   banks and the bankers and how to deal   with them I knew a lot but my   understanding of the tax code gave me a   tremendous advantage over those who   didn't have a clue about it including   many of my competitors who lost   everything they had never to be heard   from again never they would never heard   from again some people that I knew they   were good they were doing a good job   never ever to be heard from again now   they're gone and I'm here and I'm ready   to turn things around for our country   we're gonna do it   [Applause]   the early 90s was a very tough time for   the world but in tough times you need   very tough and very smart people these   are tough times for America and I will   tell you we need very tough and very   smart leadership not people who tell you   what you want to hear but people who   tell you what you need to hear we must   never allow corrupt career politicians   like the Clintons ever back into the   white house again   [Applause]   these tough times were when I performed   my very best the economy and banks they   were collapsing the government was a   mess but I enjoyed waking up every day   to go to battle and that's what it was   for three years I had an expression in   the early 90s survived till 95 and   you'll be okay and that people copied it   survive till 95 I enjoyed getting up   every morning to take on the financial   establishment on behalf of my company my   employees my family and myself and win   and that's what we did I 1 I 1 and I   kept on winning till this day I kept on   winning all you have to do is ask all of   the 17 people that we competed against   and you'll ask them how did Trump do   they'll say he won   but that's the thinking we need for our   country that's the thinking we need when   we're negotiating trade deals which are   horrible and military deals and economic   deals on behalf of the American people   we need great people negotiating our   deals for us we have the greatest   negotiators and the greatest business   people in the world and we use political   hacks to negotiate our deals not anymore   we're not not anymore   [Applause]   put me into the boardroom as your   representatives and I promise I will   deliver Hillary Clinton is in it only   for herself her donors and her special   interests I'm fighting for America many   people   [Applause]   many people have said over the years   that I perform better under pressure   than anyone they've ever seen I've   proven that over and over again and   that's what I do and that's what we have   to do right now because our country is   under tremendous pressure when the   pressure is on when the odds are stacked   against me and you because many of you   people are the same way when people say   it can't be done that's when we just get   started we're going to change things   around   [Applause]   to think that motivates me the most is   when people tell me something is   absolutely impossible from me impossible   is just a starting point that's when you   begin and remember with 20 trillion in   debt and a hundred trillion and unfunded   liabilities a lot of people say it's   impossible we're sitting on a big fat   ugly bubble and Obama doesn't allow our   fed to raise interest rates because when   those interest rates go you watch what's   going to happen it's going to be very   unattractive he'll be out playing golf   someplace but you know what they're   wrong and what they're doing and it's   unfair to the people it's unfair to the   country and they're so wrong from the   depths of that terrible real estate   depression I created a company worth   billions and billions of dollars and   created tens of thousands of jobs our   company our employees we remade i mean   we actually remade skylines together   revitalize neighborhoods rejuvenated   communities and hired thousands and   thousands of workers on november eighth   America's comeback begins and we need a   comeback   and we are going to rise up from our   present challenges bigger and better and   stronger than ever before   [Applause]   a lot of people said why are you going   to Pueblo I said number one I like to   State number one everything about Pueblo   says winner including what Dwight   Eisenhower said long ago   and they said well you think they'll   like you in pueblo i said i think so   they said they said they said well you   have a lot of hispanic / latinos in   Pueblo and I said I think that's why   they're going to like me actually that's   why they're going to like me believe me   [Applause]   what you look at what's happening with   the african-american community when you   look at what's happening with Hispanic   community very very unfair very very odd   for thank you   the people here in Puebla know what it   takes to rebuild this country this is a   city with a friend or friend or foe   friend or foe well he's got a very weak   voice so you could let him say but just   be good sir be nice be nice we all love   you you're on the other side you know   the Sanders people had so much more   spirit and vim and vigor than the   Hillary people the Hillary people are   not in the same category if Bernie   Sanders had not made the deal with the   devil he would have gone down in the   history of politics as a very rare and   unique person but when he made that deal   and I know that he wish he didn't his   follows are lost he had an event   recently where 150 people showed up to   hear him talk and I will say this we've   always had by far the biggest crowds but   you know what he was second he was   second but he made a deal with the devil   and his supporters are no longer really   his supporters any longer that I can't   argue and you know one of the one of the   things that Bernie Sanders and I agreed   on is trade and trade is something that   is so sad for this country what's   happening how do your jobs are being   taken the difference is I can do   something about it and make a bad deal   into a great deal all he knew is it was   bad and we want to do something about it   we just can't be a critic this is a city   with a rich immigrant history and a rich   Latino history   [Applause]   the Latinos love Trump right   [Applause]   that has contributed so much to this   country into the state amazing place   through the people of Pueblo thank you   and their families we've hail from all   regions they've come from all regions of   the world you are united by this one   very important factor you are all   Americans   [Applause]   and as Americans you're entitled to the   same protections as every other American   gets everyone living lawfully inside our   borders are entitled to the same things   safe communities a great education and   access to high paying jobs and really   good jobs and this isn't happening this   is the change that I will deliver   Hillary Clinton has been there for 30   years delivering nothing but talk and   failure you know the other night when we   were at the debate I noticed more than   ever before we're at the debate and she   say she's going to do this this this and   that and I said to myself why hasn't she   been doing it for 30 years right just   talk her policies have brought death and   destruction overseas and poverty at home   she's brought massive poverty for   everyone but especially for African   American and Latino citizens she comes   and tries to get their vote although I   must tell you the enthusiasm for her is   very small Don King the great boxing   promoter who endorsed me said Donald the   african-americans Donald love you Don   King big done and here's a man whether   you like him or not that's a smart   cookie a tough cookie and he's done a   job he's done a job but he said you are   going to see a big surprise on november   eighth with in hit this case he was   talking about the African Americans he   said you're going to see a big surprise   because so many african-american people   love you and they want you to really   help them out in terms of the inner   cities in particular where it's so   dangerous where education is so bad   where jobs are non-existent where youth   cannot get jobs   [Applause]   so I want to thank Don King and so many   others for their endorsement we had so   many others so many reverends and   pastors Bishop Jackson from Detroit   credible people Darrell Scott pastor   Darrell Scott so many and I'm so honored   by than believing I am honored by it and   Don said that Hillary Clinton takes the   african-american vote for granted here's   the bad news I don't think you're going   to want to go out and vote for this is   not Barack Obama where they really had   spirit to vote for him nobody has spirit   remember she called african-american   male youth super predators   who wants to vote for she's not going to   do the job anyway she opposes school   choice and she wants to trap   african-american and Latino children   into the failing government schools   because she's getting a lot of money   from the teachers unions so she doesn't   want to have choice and she doesn't want   to end common course so we can bring   education locally which is very   important she hasn't   [Applause]   we're going to get poor mine are I'm   telling you I'm telling you the   Commission on presidential debates is   operating this microphone every time the   Secret Service hears that sound like a   wall now that Commission on presidential   debates what a joke they are I got to go   through them on sunday night again and   by the way Mike Pence on Tuesday night   he has been fantastic Governor Mike   Pence what a fantastic on Tuesday night   Tuesday night we are going to get poor   minority children out of failing schools   and into the public private charter or   magnet school of their choice going to   be a big difference I'll tell you the   Latino children the african-american   children it's going to be some   difference believe me some difference   Hillary Clinton supports Obamacare and   wants to expand it and Obamacare is an   absolute disaster how much have they   raise your premiums of the Terry a   double-double how about triple quadruple   it's horrible and it's going to die of   its own weight but we are going to we   are going to terminate it and we are   going to replace it and it will be so   much better and so much less explosive   premiums in Colorado are set to go up   another twenty percent the only way to   stop this disaster is the vote for Trump   I'm telling good open don't be going   down Hillary Clinton also supports the   terrible trade deals like Bill Clinton's   NAFTA and China's entry into the World   Trade Organization and next she wants to   support trans-pacific partnership the   deal she calls the gold standard that   she lied to during the bait she said she   never called it the gold standard and   Lester Holt kept questioning me on   everything but he never questioned her   on that right and it turned out to be a   lie she called it the gold standard and   she will approve it if she gets in but   if she gets in you people have made one   bad mistake i can tell you colorado has   lost more than one in seven   manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China   deals but while you've lost out Hillary   Clinton has raked in cash from her   contributors she and Bill have made 150   million dollars in speeches and she's a   bad speaker to special interests they   gave 39 speeches to big banks including   two million dollars in speaking fees   from Goldman Sachs the Clintons received   another two million dollars from a Swiss   bank after Hillary negotiated a   favorable settlement for them as   Secretary of State   [Music]   to hide her corruption Hillary Clinton   puts her emails on an illegal secret   server open to foreign hacking then she   deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after   a congressional subpoena to hide them   from the public she lies to Congress   under oath and her ring leaders took the   Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals   explain that in so many ways it's worse   than watergate the investigation of   Hillary Clinton was rigged and it's a   shame and it's one of the saddest things   that have ever taken place in our nation   believe me what's gone on we become a   banana republic you know what we have   now today we learned that the FBI made a   side deal with Clinton stop aids to   destroy their laptops did you know this   let me repeat the FBI reportedly made a   deal to destroy the laptops of   government officials implicated in a   massive criminal cover-up I think you   have a lot of great people in the FBI   and you do indeed I think they're   extremely upset at what's going on   Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a   criminal enterprise that has corrupted   our government at the highest levels and   the American people have one chance to   stop it by showing up and voting on   November a   people have had it with the years and   decades of Clinton corruption this is   the year the American people say enough   is enough the Clintons are the sordid   past we are together as a movement all   of us outside of this area all over the   country we are the bright future now   another issue I want to address today   finally is immigration as i mentioned   Pueblo is filled with wonderful   hard-working immigrants it's these   hard-working immigrants who stand to   lose the most from our open border   immigration policy illegal immigration   and broken visa programs take jobs   directly from Latino and Hispanic   workers living here lawfully today you   know that they're taking you jobs   illegal immigration also brings with it   massive crime and massive drugs   including a terrible heroin problem   right here in Colorado you have a big   problem so we're going to build a border   wall and we are not what   we're going to build a wall and we're   going to stop the drugs the gangs the   violence from pouring into Colorado   [Applause]   we got a lot of bad people that gay men   we have great people that came in but we   have a lot of gang members we have a lot   of drug lords we have a lot of drug   sellers we're going to ship them the   hell out come immediately we're going to   shut down the sanctuary cities that have   led to the preventable deaths of so many   [Applause]   cases like Kate Steinle murdered in San   Francisco by a five-time deported   illegal immigrant who should never ever   have been here or cases like Sarah root   killed by an illegal immigrant released   at the border by President Obama and   then released again after the killing   there were over two million criminal   aliens in this country and we are going   to get them out and get them out fast   [Applause]   do the cartels the gangs the drug   dealers I have a simple message for you   your days are numbered and your reign of   crime will soon come crashing to an end   but we also have to keep our country   safe from terrorism the terrorist who   planted the bombs in new york and new   jersey and who carried out the mall   stabbing in minnesota you all saw that   last week where foreign nationals   admitted into our country as was the   mall shooter in washington look at cases   like the Boston bombers here an asylum   or the San Bernardino shooter here on a   fiance visa fee on said nice Lisa from   Saudi Arabia killed 14 people that gave   them a baby shower a short while before   and she killed him not only kill them   but many many many horribly wounded to   this day or the Orlando shooter the son   of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan   terrorists are infiltrating our country   now Hillary Clinton wants a five hundred   and fifty percent increase in Syrian   refugees and countless more refugees   from across the Middle East   I want to keep your family safe my job   is not to represent foreign countries my   job is to represent the citizens of the   United States of America putting your   jobs your wages and your security first   America first remember that America   first you are living in the United   States today as a lawful resident or a   US citizen I will ensure you have a safe   community rising wages and secure   immigration system which is what we want   immigration security is national   security very important it's national   security here are some of the things we   will do starting in 2017 we're going to   lower your taxes substantially

and we're going to appoint   justices to the Supreme Court of the   United States who will upholding we are   going to finally rebuild America we are   going to revitalize America we are going   to unite America we're going to come   together as a people imagine what our   country could accomplish if we started   working together as one people under one   God saluting one American flag

LDjyef3prnM~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161027~Full Speech: Donald Trump Rally in Springfield, Ohio (10/27/2016) Trump Springfield Ohio Speech~10161.0~4.83651208878~352.0~15.0~   [Music]   haha   hey   [Music]   [Music]   love is   yes   [Music]   Oh   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Applause]   thank you very much thank you   unbelievable   people don't know I worked in Ohio did   you know that and I had a great   experience and if I didn't have a great   experience starting out when I was very   young maybe I wouldn't be here right now   who knows you need that it was great for   confidence also in 12 days we're going   to win Ohio and we are going to win back   the White House   a brand new poll from Remington research   highly respected has just a few minutes   ago come out and in Ohio we are right   now four points up   early voting is underway so make sure   get out and vote we don't wanna we don't   want to give this away you know we have   a movement going on like they've never   seen before in this country drain the   swamps got to drain the swamp sign back   boy you're going to drain the swamp   believe me but this is a movement like   they've never seen in this country   before and every place is packed and the   greatest people on earth and we're going   to turn our country around we're turning   around fast seventy-five percent of the   people think our country is headed in   the wrong direction we know it's headed   the wrong direction we're going to fix   it we're going to take our country back   and it's going to be put very quickly on   the right track real change begins with   immediately repealing and replacing   Obamacare   it's just been announced that Americans   are going to experience another massive   double digit hike in Obamacare you see   that   including premiums like in the great   state of Arizona where they're going to   go up at a hundred and sixteen percent   don't worry you'll be there very soon   unless I win in which case you're not   gonna have to worry about even Bill   Clinton admitted that Obamacare is quote   the craziest thing in the world where   people wind up paying their premiums   which double and their coverage is cut   in half job-killing job-killing   Obamacare is just one more way the   system is rigged remember the name   Jonathan Gruber the architect of   Obamacare he said they could pass   Obamacare when he didn't know he was   being recorded he said they could pass   Obamacare because the stupidity of the   American voter will allow it to take   place the only stupidity was that   incredible stupidity shown by our   politicians when they force this bill   through over the furious objection to   many politicians in all fairness many   many politicians but really the American   people and it was very very sad and in   all fairness to the Democrats had our   president not lied 28 times remember you   can keep your plan you can keep you   doctor it passed by this much they would   not have gone for it but they believed   him to like everybody else believed him   they've caught a bit a lot of lies   lately folks Hillary Clinton talking   about liars wants to double down   a big liar Hillary Clinton wants to   double down at Obamacare and make it   even worse so here I'm going to repeal   it replace it we're going to have a   replacement that is so much less   expensive and so much better you don't   even get to here in Ohio another five   insurance companies are dropping out of   Obamacare got good luck good luck in   negotiations folks that means that all   the residents covered by plans from   these companies will be getting   cancellation notices very soon Obamacare   it is really and you know this a   catastrophic it's a catastrophic event   for Ohio workers and is making it   impossible for many parents to pay their   bills support their families or get   quality medical care to their children   repealing Obamacare is one of the single   most important reasons we must win on   november eighth   have to win real change also means   getting rid of the corruption in   Washington DC Hillary Clinton bleached   and deleted 33 thousand emails lied to   Congress under oath made 13 phone calls   I mean 13 13 phones made them disappear   sometimes with a hammer right boom boom   let's get rid of these long and then   told the FBI she couldn't remember 39   different times the Clinton crew gave   more than six hundred and seventy-five   thousand dollars to the wife of the   deputy director of the FBI and the man   who was overseeing the investigation   into Hillary's illegal server a server   we now know Obama knew about just found   that out yesterday WikiLeaks   the more emails WikiLeaks releases the   more lines between the Clinton   Foundation the Secretary of State's   office and the Clintons personal   finances they all get learned just today   we read about Clinton confident Doug   brand bragging that he had funneled tens   of millions of dollars to Bill Clinton   ink through the foundation donations   paid speeches and consulting contracts   mr. band called the arrangement   unorthodox the rest of us call it   outright corrupt in fact the Clinton   Foundation even hired a law firm to find   out if they're paid to play scheme would   jeopardize their charitable status with   the IRS if the Clintons were willing to   play this fast and loose with their   enterprise when they weren't in the   White House just imagine what they'll do   given the chance to once again control   the Oval Office and we've had enough   honestly I think we've had enough of the   Clintons and offer Helen huh I mean at   what point at what point do we say it   Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt   person ever to seek the office of the   presidency I proposed a contract with   the American voter that will end the   corruption and give the government back   to the people I want the entire corrupt   Washington establishment to hear and to   heed the words I'm about to say if we   win on november eighth   oh ok when we win another   we don't want to take it for granted but   we are winning in a lot of states I have   to say the media now they're going wild   the media's going wild because they're   saying you know this guy's winning in   Florida he's winning in North Carolina   he's winning in Iowa he's winning in   Ohio all right when we win but we are   going to Washington DC and we are going   to drain the swamp   [Applause]   a lot of spirit of this road is a good   that includes a constitutional amendment   to impose term limits on all members of   Congress at the core of my contract is   my economic plan that plan can be   summarized in three very beautiful words   especially for the people in this area   and this room jobs jock jock   [Applause]   now it's terrible what's happened what's   happened to this area what's happened to   this country with jobs is terrible   Hillary Clinton promised to bring   upstate New York 200,000 jobs when she   ran for Senate instead the jobs left   they didn't come in they left she's been   there for 30 years and hasn't fixed   anything she's just made things worse   except for herself and her husband 47   million Americans are on food stamps and   45 million Americans live in poverty   nearly one in four Americans in their   prime earning years are not working or   able to work 70 million American women   and children are in poverty or in the   brink of poverty and nearly half of   african-american children under the age   of six are living in abject poverty our   national debt has doubled in eight years   and our infrastructure throughout our   country is crumbling bad shape our   airports our roads our bridges or   tunnels our schools our hospitals our   trade deficit with the world is down   nearly 800 billion dollars a year we are   living through the greatest jobs theft   in the history of the world think of it   and that's so true it's a single   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world what our politicians have   allowed to happen to this area but to   all areas of our country NAFTA TPP they   want to approve a disaster   Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing   jobs since NAFTA a deal signed by Bill   Clinton and supported strongly by Hilary   Kane remember every time you see a   clothes factory a wiped-out community in   Ohio it was essentially caused by the   Clintons it was NAFTA it was caused by   the Clintons why a deal like that was   allowed we've lost seventy thousand   factories think of that one seventy I   tell everybody it's a typo can't be   70,000 it is we've lost seventy thousand   factories since China entered the World   Trade Organization another bill and   hillary back disaster just this year   eaton corporation in ohio closed his   plan laid off 152 workers and move their   jobs to mexico and you've had many i   could I could name them all day long   under my contract if a company wants to   fire their workers move to Mexico or   other countries and ship their products   back into the United States we will put   a 35-percent tariff on those pronto   and folks just in case you have any   questions when that happens you're not   losing your companies anymore and if you   do at least the country's gonna make a   lot of money okay we will immediately   begin renegotiating NAFTA and if we   don't get the deal we want right now   it's a one-way highway we lose our jobs   we lose our companies we lose everything   lose our cash I would say they get the   cash they get the jobs they get the   companies we get the drugs we get the   unemployment that's what we get we get   nothing we get less than nothing we will   terminate NAFTA and get a much better   deal for our workers if we can't   renegotiate it properly we're going to   get a better deal for our workers and   for our companies because we cannot   continue to be the people led by stupid   people we can okay   as part of our plan to bring back   American jobs we will lower taxes on our   businesses from thirty five percent down   to fifteen percent we will also cut   taxes for middle-class families by   thirty-five percent and massively   simplify taxes for all Americans we will   be a rich nation once again but to be a   rich country we must also be a safe   country Hillary Clinton unleashed Isis   unto the world you know that story and   spreading violently it's spreading now   into the United States there are now   1000 open Isis investigations in the   United States Isis is on a campaign of   genocide against Christians in the   Middle East or what they call the nation   of the cross okay the nation of the   cross they are crucifying drowning and   beheading their victims this is   something that we would read about in   history books and not since medieval   times right have you heard the   beheadings and all of the things that   are happening so we have no choice we   will stop Isis and we will stop them   [Applause]   and unlike what they've done in Mosul   which is turning out to be very   difficult we're not giving three and   four months notice we're coming in we're   coming in do you think General George   Patton would say we're coming in in   three or four months get ready what a   bunch they're throwing people off   buildings hanging their victims from   meat hooks to hanging their victims so   matrix the New York Post just published   reports about Isis crushing children to   death and burning adults alive now   Hilary wants massive immigration from   the most dangerous regions of the world   where Isis operates including a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees over and above the   thousands and thousands that President   Obama is taken we don't want Isis in our   country the hillary refugee plan would   leave us with generations of terrorism   radicalism and extremism inside of our   shores i only want to admit people who   will support this country and love its   people so good   keeping our family safe is the highest   obligation of the President of the   United States a trump administration is   going to suspend immigration from tara   prone regions and we will suspend the   Syrian refugee program that was easy   we're not going to take the risk when it   comes to the safety of the American   people no longer so let me state this as   clearly as I can if I'm elected   president I am going to keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of our   country   [Applause]   Oh   [Applause]   Hilary also said she wants totally open   borders no one who supports open borders   can ever serve as president of the   United States totally open borders a   trump administration will also secure   defend the borders of the United States   and yes we will build a wall after   we have to   ah   and who is going to pay for the wall   [Applause]   look hundred percent Mexico in terms of   our trade deficits is making a fortune   off the United States their leaders are   doing a much smarter job but you know   what we'll be happy with Mexico Mexico   is going to be wonderful we're gonna   have a great relationship with Mexico   and with China and with other we don't   even have good relationships now they   rip us off and we still don't get along   at least they should be nice to us   they're not even nice they'll be nice   thousands of Americans have been killed   by illegal immigrants right here in Ohio   60 year old Margaret Castle dick was   murdered in cold blood by an illegal   immigrant earlier that day our killer   shot another woman in the arm while she   was with her children in a nearby park   police encounter demand more than three   weeks before the crime scene but federal   authorities refused to take him into   custody even though people were saying   please please don't let him out please   take him in then there is the case of 90   year old Earl Olander a Minnesota farmer   who was brutally beaten by illegal   immigrants and left to bleed to death in   his home Earl's body was found with his   hands bound behind his back in duct tape   a blunt force injury to his head his   killers had criminal records but they   did not meet the Obama administration's   priorities for removal   but others that new home and others that   do them we're pleading we're pleading   don't let them out don't let them into   our society I have a message for the   cartels the drug dealers and the gang   members when I win your long reign of   crime and terror and horror will come to   a very beautiful crashing end   [Applause]   we will also repeal Obama Clinton   defense cuts and rebuild our badly   depleted military our Air Force is the   smallest and oldest it's ever been did   you know that because I know what you   have here you guys are good with   wright-patterson right what a great   place but we're very depleted we have   old equipment we will build brand new   modern state-of-the-art planes to fly   right Adam wright-patterson Air Force   Base we have a lot of veterans here   today I want to thank them for their   service and let them know as president I   have your back believe me   I have your back   we will she just said make America great   again mr. Trump we will make America   great again don't worry about we were   and it won't take too long and we will   change our foreign policy Hillary   Clinton's policies in Iraq and Syria   Libya through the middle east into total   turmoil we're spending six trillion   dollars on wars in the Middle East while   our own country falls into total   disrepair now Hilary wants to start a   shooting war in Syria conflict with a   nuclear power Russian which could very   well lead to World War three and the way   she talks about Putin she's always said   she has no idea but she's always saying   WikiLeaks it's Russia and Donald Trump I   have nothing to do with Russia fuck they   said maybe Donald Trump is involved in   projects with the Russian the answer's   no no but what she does she says Donald   Trump in Russia luck luck she speaks so   badly of Putin nuclear country she   speaks so badly I say and she uses it to   try and get votes I said to myself you   know how do you speak so badly of   somebody I mean how would they get   everything along wouldn't it be great if   we actually got along with Russia and   other countries and we together when   after Isis and knock the hell out of   them would that be a good   because they want to get him out all but   she speaks very badly a Putin and I   don't think that's smart you know you   could be very tough but you shouldn't be   doing what she's doing as her own team   has said in WikiLeaks she has terrible   instincts to all Americans I say it's   time for new leadership it really is   time brilliant   can you imagine four more years of Obama   that's what you get it   it's high taxes it's high regulations   all these companies they can't even   breathe with the regulations unnecessary   it's Isis all over the place you know   she says she'll stop Isis let me tell   you there was no Isis there was no Isis   during her term she created with Obama a   vacuum in Iraq Isis formed and then   Obama called him the JV junior varsity   right well they're not the JV anymore   folks they're going to be no trouble we   are going to knock them so hard but look   look they're not the JV and they weren't   then and now they're in 32 different   countries so she's saying we will get   rid of Isis she wants to go back home   and go to sleep that's what she wants   did you see where she got upset   yesterday because I took a little while   just a few hours to cut a ribbon to make   sure my kids did a good job we built the   building by the way under budget and   ahead of schedule   [Applause]   this is a Donald Trump got off the   campaign trail I mean I've been doing   six seven eight things a day every   single day she's home sleeping half the   time I say she's definitely a low-energy   person I said where is Hillary I watched   after the last debate and after the   second debate she was tired Wow she   walked off that stage gross get a lot of   people around they had a lot of people   around her which was smart everything   will change in November just think about   what we can accomplish in the first 100   days we're going to have the biggest tax   cut since Ronald Reagan we're going to   eliminate

they're going to be about   thirty minutes late they called us and   said could you wait I said absolutely   not let's get going right let's get   going New Hampshire and just so you   understand New Hampshire has a special   place in my heart because this is where   I won my first primary   and we are going to stop the heroin and   we are gonna stop all of the problems   that you have because you have a man   we're gonna stop them okay   you're always going to have it I mean   this you're always going to have a very   special place in my heart so new pulse   have just come out and we're leading in   many of the battleground states and   we're leading all over the country the   LA Times says the six points up   nationwide on November 8 New Hampshire   can be the state that pushes us over the   top   we're going to win New Hampshire and   we're going to win back the White House   and we're going to make America great   again remember that remember that it's   going to be a victory for the people and   especially those people who haven't had   hope in a long time that's a lot of   people believe me that's a lot of great   people that means cities like Flint   Michigan I was there yesterday in 1970   Flint had over 80,000 residents working   at the General Motors plant 80,000 today   it's less than 8,000 people and heading   south believe me   40% of the city lives in poverty and now   Ford think of it Ford you read about it   today for does just announced they're   moving all small cog production small   car the little ones you know but they're   pretty big they're probably moving all   production they just don't want to say   it eventually I was right I was right   I've been saying this was going to   happen for years to Michigan to Ohio to   every place that makes cars and it's   getting worse and worse well they're   moving to Mexico on top of all the other   car production that they've moved there   and that other companies have moved   there this is we are creating the car   capital of the world in Mexico believe   me folks and I'm going to make sure that   ends if I'm elected it's going to end   so I went to Flint yesterday to address   the water crisis it's a failure at every   single level of government it's tragic   and it's heartbreaking and should never   happen in the United States of America   ever it used to be cars were made in   Flint and you couldn't drink the water   in Mexico now the cars are made in   Mexico and you can't drink the water in   Flint that's what's happening to our   country see that's what's happening to   our country this is what happens when we   build up other countries instead of our   own we lose control it's time to take   care of our people and our workers I'm   campaigning in every community and if   you think this is easy it's not I've   been all over the place Wall Street you   know if you would have looked today all   over including Waldorf Astoria today we   made a big speech on the economy etc and   I go from there to another place to here   and I love doing it because what we're   doing is a movement what we're doing   you're gonna be so proud of your country   very very soon so just remember so proud   and it is a movement that it's a   movement that everybody's talking about   everybody's talking about it I'm running   to be the president of all Americans our   support comes from all regions and   backgrounds and all walks of life you   are the cops and soldiers the carpenters   and welders the accountants and lawyers   young and old rich and poor black white   Latino but above all we're all Americans   all of us together or   [Applause]   while Hillary Clinton   [Applause]   slanders you as deplorable and   irredeemable that means you can't ever   get better she doesn't understand you I   call you hard-working American patriots   who love your family and love your   country her comments displayed the same   sense of arrogance and entitlement that   led her to violate federal laws   Secretary of State I didn't delete her   emails   destroy her phones with a hammer but   classified information in the reach of   our enemies lie to Congress and sell   government favors and access through the   Clinton Foundation it's the same   attitude of arrogance and entitlement   that explains why she has never taken   accountability for the disasters she   created all over the world in Libya   Syria Iraq Iran all over it's the same   reason why she won't take responsibility   for her central role in unleashing Isis   it's what happened bad decisions she has   bad judgment Bernie Sanders told us that   obviously Bernie you know a rigged   system with the super delegates and   Bernie's right now home watching us   together but in all fairness Bernie   Sanders said she suffers from bad   judgment he's right her policies have   created disaster overseas and poverty at   home so many places I'm running to   reverse these failures and to create a   new American future and it will be   and that future begins with prosperity   at home my economic agenda can be summed   up in three words jobs jobs jobs   boom our jobs have been taken away from   us they've gone to Mexico and they've   gone all over the world but they've been   taken away by incompetent politicians   that don't know what's happening or   politicians that do know what's   happening but they're being bossed by   special interest their donors you know   what's happening my economic plan   rejects the cynicism that says our labor   force will keep shrinking that our jobs   will keep leaving and that our economy   can never grow as it did once before and   there's no reason why it shouldn't be   able to grow even better everything that   is broken today can be fixed and every   failure can be turned into a great great   success it's going to happen   [Applause]   and by the way I just see off stage a   very special person has anyone ever   heard of Eric trump Eric come up Eric my   son Eric jump he is working and Ivanka   and Dawn and Tiffany and all of them   they are working are we not proud of   this man what is it guys 53 days to go   or something that we are going to make   America great we are gonna win that   there's no question about it we will not   let you down   thank you guys for being here tonight   [Applause]   thank you Eric he has been working hard   his sister - and his brother Don and   Tiffany made a great speech and Milania   made a greats be everybody they're   working so hard   [Applause]   and boy the press likes to hit them   right boy the press likes to hit him and   there's such good kids but they can take   it or can you take it I think so right   they're good kids it's time to stop   fighting over the smallest words and   start dreaming about the great things we   can achieve together as a country Jobs   can stop leaving our country and start   pouring in we're gonna take a minute no   longer a one-way highway into oblivion   failing schools can become flourishing   schools crumbling roads and bridges can   become gleaming new infrastructure inner   cities can experience a flood of new   jobs and investment and rising crime can   give way to safe and prosperous   communities all of these things and so   much more are possible we have such   potential in this country but to   accomplish them we must replace the   present policy of globalism which has   moved so many jobs and so much wealth   out of our country and replace it with a   new policy of Americanism it's what it   is America   I am NOT running to be the president of   the world I'm running to be the   president of the United States of   America   thank you and I'm spending a lot of my   money doing this I want to tell you   these other people it's all donations   let the money pour in we're spending a   lot you better make sure I win on   November 8th because I'm gonna have   wasted a hell of a lot of time energy   and money you know when they tell me mr.   chump it doesn't matter what you've   accomplished   first of all I've accomplished nothing   you've accomplished I'm the messenger   but what you've accomplished is so   incredible I say unless we win we've   accomplished nothing just remember we   have to win on November 8th we have to   get there get everybody New Hampshire   got a vote it's time to replace our   failed political system with a new   American system if we lower our taxes   which we're going to do big-league   remove destructive regulations and we   will be chopping unleash the vast   treasure of American energy and   negotiate trade deals that put America   first then there is no limit to the   number of jobs we can create and the   amount of prosperity we can unleash   America will truly be the greatest place   in the world to invest to hire to grow   and to create new jobs new technologies   and entire new industries America   America   made in America remember   he remembers some of my older folks here   right   we know made in America you remember you   don't see that very often   and you're seeing it less and less we're   going to bring it back made in America   my first day in office I'm going to   order a review of every single   regulation issued over the last eight   years all needless job-killing   regulations will be canceled millions of   new jobs will come pouring in we're   going to lift the restrictions on   American energy which means lower   electricity prices and half a million   new jobs a year big stuff and that's   just the beginning also on my first day   I'm going to ask Congress to send me a   bill to immediately repeal and replace   disastrous Obama care   so disaster this will instantly save   another two million jobs I'm also going   to completely reform our trade deals we   are going to renegotiate the words trade   deal ever made in the history not of our   country in the history of the world   NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton a disaster   we're gonna stand up to China and keep   America out of TPP that's another   disaster we don't need another massive   multinational deal that ties us up and   binds us down and is so complicated that   nobody in our country understands it   other countries they know every word   they know every sentence every paragraph   our people they don't even read deals   they sign whatever is put in front of   them just take a look at what happened   with Obamacare practically nobody in   Congress read it and what a mess we have   New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3   think of it one in three manufacturing   jobs since NAFTA and one in four since   China joined the World Trade   Organization both Hillary Clinton backed   disasters bad judgment remember bad   judgment and I'm going to appoint the   best and toughest trade negotiators and   we have the best in the world we have   the greatest business people and the   greatest negotiators and the way we   don't use them we use political hacks   we're going to stand up and defend our   American workers any deal that doesn't   increase jobs and wages in America I   will oppose and I mean seriously opposed   not politician oppose we are going to   turn our bad trade deals into great ones   another major reform is going to be   school choice I've outlined and by the   way we are going to terminate Common   Core and   [Applause]   I've outlined a plan to provide every   disadvantaged child in America the   freedom to choose the private public   magnet or religious school of his or her   choice   this will help lift millions of poor   african-american and Hispanic children   out of poverty the poverty in our   country is unbelievable it's time to   break up the failed Democratic control   over our inner cities and provide real   hope and opportunity to every single   community in this nation our policies or   taxes trade regulations and education   will grow incomes will boost and go   right through the roof we have to   increase people's incomes do you know   that many people in this room made more   money 18 years ago in real wages think   of it than they do now they're working   harder now they're older and many people   because of Obamacare and for other   reasons are holding two jobs so you're   getting older you're working harder and   you make it less I don't think that   sounds great   the only good thing is that I'm also   working a hell of a lot harder than I've   ever worked be hard awesome so I don't   feel so sorry for working hard   [Applause]   but we're enjoying it because we see the   fruits of our labor we see what's   happening and in 52 days you're gonna   have a lot of happy people in this state   and in this country   so we want to reduce poverty for our   african-american and Hispanic   communities have to since President   Obama came into office another 2 million   Hispanic Americans have fallen into   poverty   this is unacceptable to the Hispanic   community I say we are going to protect   your jobs we are going to build up your   schools and we are going to deliver   safety and opportunity for your children   safety also means protecting our people   from radical Islamic terrorism   [Applause]   my opponent wants a five hundred and   fifty percent increase in Syrian   refugees you saw what happened yesterday   hundreds of thousands of people are   being approved to pour into the country   we have no idea who they are what a   mistake the great Trojan horse   two hundred years from now they'll be   saying boy that was a bad bad couple of   years you know folks we all have a big   heart and we want to build safe havens   we owe twenty trillion dollars very soon   the debts doubled under Obama but we owe   twenty trillion dollars the Gulf states   have a lot of money we're gonna get them   to put up the money we'll build it they   have to put up the money   we'll build safe havens we'll take care   of people but we cannot let them come   into our country we just here not now   according to the Senate Subcommittee on   immigration her entire plan will bring   in six hundred and twenty thousand   refugees in her first term and cost our   country four hundred billion dollars   what are we doing what are we doing   instead of providing free health care   and jobs to refugees from around the   world   we should rebuild our inner cities and   help struggling Americans and we should   work with Hispanics we should work with   African American citizens and help our   inner cities and we should take care of   our great veterans who are not being   treated properly   [Applause]   they have their priorities so very wrong   I support the construction of safe zones   in the region and we will get the Gulf   states we're gonna get them to pay for   it the Gulf states wouldn't be there   very long if it wasn't for us at the   same time that's right keep the oil   remember my statement shouldn't go in   but if you go in when you go out keep   the oil now we wouldn't do a thing like   that it's not politically correct right   at the same time we will rebuild our   military which is so badly depleted with   the greatest people on earth run ago we   are going to get our allies to pay their   fair share you know we defend many   countries and we're getting socked on   that one too we get socked on everything   only five of the 28 member NATO   countries you remember I've been talking   about this they say I don't like NATO I   like NATO but we have five out of the 28   countries that are paying their   obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense   so don't you think they're supposed to   be paying maybe I will convey of our   European and Asian allies to make sure   that everyone is sharing the security   burden and that we are properly focused   on protecting our country and other   countries frankly from radical Islamic   terrorism a word and a phrase that   President Obama and Hillary Clinton just   refused to use and unless you're going   to use it and unless you're going to say   it you're never ever going to be able to   do anything about it just remember that   in all things it's time to put Americans   first and time to start taking care of   each other we have to take care of each   other   [Applause]   and is there any place it's better to be   than a Trump rally in New Hampshire here   we are hopeless there's no place better   and you know what else there's no place   safer earlier this week I rolled out a   plan to help our mothers and our   families get affordable quality child   care for their children   my daughter Ivanka was so helpful she is   so dedicated to that and she's been   talking about that long before June 16th   of last year when I decided that we have   to do this on policy after policy we're   going to provide opportunity prosperity   and security for all Americans I'm going   to lower your taxes beyond any number   you thought possible   [Applause]   and by the way Hillary Clinton is going   to raise your taxes very very   substantial cheers very very   substantially I'm going to get rid of   massive amounts of unnecessary   regulations on business and in your life   it's killing your businesses I'm going   to repeal and replace Obamacare I'm   going to appoint justices of the Supreme   Court who will follow the Constitution   I'm going to rebuild our depleted   military and we're going to take care of   our vets we have plenty of them here   tonight   I'm going to save your Second Amendment   which is underseas   [Applause]   and the NRA gave us the earlier by the   earliest endorsement they've ever given   so I want to thank the NRA these are   great people he's a great people you've   got to get out and but if you want to   save you a second amendment believe me   you have to get out and vote I'm going   to stop illegal immigration and drugs   coming into our country and yes we will   build the wall   [Applause]   that's right we will we will build the   wall in Mexico will pay for the wall   believe me   hey we'll hey well we have a trade   deficit that's so massive with Mexico   that the wall is a peanut compared to   what we're losing they will pay for the   wall they just don't know it yet okay   believe me they're gonna pay for it and   they'll be happy to do it just has to be   explained properly I'm going to so   importantly renegotiate your disastrous   trade deals especially left after now   NAFTA is turning out to be the worst but   we're going to renegotiate and we will   make great treaties and we'll put our   American workers first but here's the   thing if for some reason we can't   renegotiate NAFTA they could say no   unlikely but they could say no we will   terminate NAFTA and we'll have new trade   deals that will be phenomenal for the   United States of America and our other   major companies will start making their   iPhones and their computers and other   products inside the United States not in   China and all over the world except here   okay because that's what's happening   right now big league we don't make our   products anymore in the United States   but we will again like never before mark   my words   we will rebuild our roads our bridges   tunnels highways airport schools and   hospitals American cars will travel the   roads American planes will soar the   skies and American ships will patrol   beautifully the scene American Steel   will send new skyscrapers high into the   clouds American hands

world has never seen   before never seen before I also want to   give a very special thanks to our   veterans a lot of veterans in this room   thank you thank you   service members military families   unbelievable people yesterday was the   75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor and a   reminder of the countless Americans who   made the ultimate sacrifice for this and   our country America's men and women in   uniform of the finest and brave is the   world has ever known   and by the way folks we are going to be   building up our military it will no   longer be a depleted military I promise   so

will   never ever let you down never will honor   your service your sacrifice and that   really begins with defending and   respecting our American flag   I think you'll be liking some of the   things we'll be putting forward in the   not-too-distant future do you know what   I mean yes you know what I mean when   Pearl Harbor was attacked one man who   immediately listed to defend his country   was John Glenn for the next seven   decades he devoted his life to serving   the American people which he did from   the cockpit of his bullet-riddled   fighter jet tough times in the   weightless silence of his Mercury   speakers oh that's okay   that's okay   we have to respect John Glenn that's   alright I think they're actually on our   side they just don't know it yet   they will be soon   but John was also in the weightless   silence of his mercury spacecraft and   later in the halls of the US Capitol our   nation mourns the passing of one of our   great heroes he was a giant among men   and a true American legend who inspired   generations of explorers and dreamers   and we will honor his legacy by   continuing to push new frontiers in   science technology and space in filling   my cabinet I'm looking for people who   fully understand the meaning of service   and who are committed to advancing the   common good one such man who by the way   our country has fallen in love with is   General James mad dog matter he doesn't   lose he doesn't listen   we were together last night he's a great   guy a generals general they call him   earlier this week I formally announced   my plans to nominate him as your new   Secretary of Defense I believe we're in   the process of putting together one of   the great cabinets that has ever been   assembled in the history of our nation   do you like it so far everybody I also   want to take this opportunity to thank   your great senators Chuck Grassley great   guy really great guy and a woman I've   gotten to know very well a tremendous   woman phenomenal person that's right   Joni Ernst they're gonna be tremendous   partners in the Senate and there right   now in Washington DC working very hard   or something that's very interesting but   they are tremendous two tremendous   people they never wavered you know we   had some people they would waver write   waver and as long as they came back   sometime prior to the vote   they're alright but we don't like people   that waver right those who didn't waver   I'll tell you who else didn't waver your   governor did not waver I want to talk   about he didn't waver not even a little   bit   and soon I'm going to invite onto stage   one of the newest additions to our   administration amen you know well one of   the most important relationships we must   improve and we have to approve is our   relationship with China   [Applause]   the nation of China is responsible for   almost half of America's trade deficit   China is not a market economy to get a   lot of help and that's why we designate   them as being a non market economy big   thing they haven't played by the rules   and I know it's time that they're going   to start they're going to start   forgotten first we're all in this thing   together folks we got to play by the   rules folks you have the massive theft   of intellectual property putting unfair   taxes on our companies not helping with   the Menace of North Korea like they   should and the Act will and massive   devaluation of their currency and   product dumping other than that they've   been wonderful right but I have to tell   you the man that is going to be coming   up here very soon every single time I've   spoken as I going on to the stage she'd   said please mr. Trump see that he could   call me mr. Trump now he just called me   president-elect I can you believe it   wasn't for him I probably wouldn't be   president-elect but he orders would say   mr. Trump Donald don't say anything bad   about China when you're in Iowa okay I   said why because I have so many friends   there I like them and they like me and   we do well with China we do well with   China so when it came to thinking about   the ambassador to China right I started   saying now wait a minute this is big   stuff and I can't tell you how many   people wanted that position you know   it's not bad you go over there you live   like a king but he's not looking to live   like a king he and his beautiful wife   came to my office the other day they're   looking to work on that relationship   because he knows the people and the   leaders in China for so many years   he knew your current leader years ago   and he said he will be the ultimate   leader when he was just a young guy but   you have a very special man and I just   want to tell you officially the man I   have chosen as our ambassador to China   is the man who knows China and likes   China better like China if you're gonna   be over there do we agree and knows how   to deliver results and he will deliver   results just like he's been delivering   results for 23 years for the great   farmers and for the people of Iowa   he's been on six trade missions to China   and is highly respected by all of the   Chinese officials he's also a native of   Iowa America's longest serving a   governor in the history of our country   twenty-three years think of that in the   history you don't know what it is to be   a governor for four years is tough 23   years and has done an incredible job   he's also become a great friend of mine   I am now honored to welcome to the stage   our next ambassador to China your   governor and I can truly say you're   great Governor Terry Branstad come up   town   is a big room   [Applause]   Wow president elect Trump fellow Iowans   [Applause]   it has been a great honor and privilege   to serve the people of this state and   thanks to our great new president who's   going to make America great again I am   very proud to serve America in this very   important role thank you very much   [Applause]   he's gonna do so great with Terry on our   side   I know we will succeed in bringing our   jobs back and I also know that China has   been so tough and so competitive and   frankly dealing with people that didn't   get it but I'll tell you what we're   gonna have mutual respect but a mutual   respect and China's going to benefit and   we're gonna benefit and Terry's going to   lead the way so I just want to   congratulate but you accomplish your   goals we must reject the failed   approaches of the past government must   stop listening to the special interests   and start delivering for the national   interest it's time to deliver for you   the American people just like Iowa   delivered for me what did you deliver   boy did you deliver you know just to go   into this for a second so we won almost   every single County in the state we won   by over 10 points we won one County that   wasn't one since Dwight the Eisenhower   anybody know the name of the county   correct and we had a great night and   Iowa was announced very early and so was   Ohio then we want Ohio by almost nine   points and we were expected to win Ohio   by two points or three so we won by nine   that made the other side a little bit   nervous and then my friends right in   this room got announced right and we won   by 10 points and then when they looked   at the map of Iowa and they saw almost   every single County and it was   incredible and the other server said   well maybe those two are flukes and then   we won Florida and we want South   Carolina   we won North Carolina   and we want Pennsylvania and we want   Michigan and we want Wisconsin and we   want Georgia and Texas and Utah   remember Utah remember Utah whether I   said this guy this unknown person that   he's doing so well   remember he they said Utah is in play   now nobody know Republicans have a loss   Utah and I went through my peoples who   your problems Utah's in play and there's   a guy that I mean I never saw this guy   he's supposed to be doing well and it   was like we're tied and they had Hillary   actually in third place and this is a   case where I wanted her to be in second   place to be honest so this guy   supposedly was in second place and they   said Texas right   they said Texas very close Georgia are   very close and they had it so close too   close to call this is before the   election and then the elected joke he   just said it no well there a lot of   dishonesty out there so now the polls   open and they go Texas goes to chunk   Georgia goes to Trump Utah right at the   beginning I want him in like landslides   I'm saying what's been going on right I   said what's been going on for the last   ten weeks they're in play you know the   expression they uses there in plain   meaning they're very close they weren't   supposed to be to play guess what they   weren't in play so it's sort of nice so   where the polls opened up and   immediately they said Trump wins Texas   Trump with Sullivan but they said very   important to me   Trump wins Iowa that was a big one   that's a big one that was a big one and   the numbers were so big that you know   for the rest of the night the other   side's gonna run said it's our big   dumper that's a lot more than we were   supposed to lose by so I love you folks   I really this is sort of a you know this   is a thank you and it's a Thank You Iowa   and it's a thank you Ohio and   Pennsylvania and North Carolina and   Florida and a lot of the states that   were so so crucial and we want every one   and Nebraska guy from Nebraska actually   we won Nebraska - right we're one mom   Nebraska goes twice that we want it   twice   and we had a lot of people in Nebraska a   lot of good wealthy people fighting us   right that didn't work but those wealthy   people aren't so unhappy now because the   stock market's gone up so much because   of us that those wealthy people just got   wealthier right now and a lot of buses   they were busting people from all over   the place that we still won both of them   the American worker built this country   and now it's time for American workers   to have a government that for the first   time in decades answers to them I'm   going to answer to them my plan begins   with bold structural reform to create   millions of really good paying jobs jobs   whether it's agriculture medicine or   military technology we want the next   generation of innovation and production   to happen right here at America and   right here in Iowa you're gonna be big   benefices big benefit   first on taxes we're going to undertake   one of the great tax reforms and   simplifications in American history   gotta be simpler too much work too   complicated at the center of this plan   is massive tax relief for the American   middle class has been forgotten   forgotten boy did they come out and vote   huh they came out and uh you know I   think both parties to a certain extent   but especially the other side they   forgot about those people that's why I   call him the Forgotten men and the   Forgotten women they're not forgotten   anymore folks but not forgotten they're   not forgotten anymore we're also going   to lower a business tax rate from 35%   all the way down to 15% that's going to   be good   gonna prime the pump gotta prime the   pump got to get the jobs got 96 million   people out there we got to get them   going and they want to work they gave up   looking for jobs they can have their   choice of jobs there you watch they're   gonna have their choice wouldn't it be   nice if you went around and you go home   to your wife or your husband and you say   Harry or Sally I don't know which one to   take I've got so many options I've got   so many options please   Sally help me choose but you're gonna   have that you're gonna have now options   you haven't had that for a long time you   take whatever you can get we're gonna   have options on regulations we're going   to eliminate every single wasteful   regulation that hurts our farms our   workers and our small business and you   saw today   Scott Bruin whose tremendous guy who has   been met with tremendous applause from   the business community we're going to   protect the family farm and we are going   to end the EPA intrusion into your lives   on energy we will cancel the job-killing   restrictions on the production of   American energy and that means lower   energy prices for farmers households and   small businesses in Iowa and frankly all   over the United States   we will also pursue an agenda of   conservation protecting our beautiful   natural resources for future Americans   your family your children and lots of   other people and we're going to ensure   clean air and clean water for all of our   people regulations by the way will be   cut down to a fraction of what they are   now and believe it or not   environmentally you'll be protected   better and we'll have jobs okay we'll   have jobs on infrastructure I am going   to ask Congress to pass legislation that   produces one trillion dollars of new   investment in America's crumbling   infrastructure and it is indeed   crumbling that includes major new   projects for both our rural communities   and our inner cities which have also   been forgotten   and we will put our people not people   from other lands our people back to work   in the process okay it's time to help   Americans get off the welfare and get   back into the labor market and they're   gonna want to do it they're gonna want   to do it   rebuilding this country with American   hands by American workers we're gonna do   it we're gonna have people that haven't   worked for years they get a love working   I gotta love it they're going to be   incentivized my administration will   follow two simple rules by American and   hire American remember years ago we used   to proudly display made in the USA you   go get a car right and we have a set   made in the USA Mia we don't see have   you ever seen it I don't see it anymore   we ought to start doing that any of the   manufacturers that we're doing a lot of   a lot of talking to a lot of companies   that we're thinking about moving and I   tell ya I don't think they're gonna be   leaving so fast anymore they're not   gonna be leaving so fast   anymore because we love our companies   and we love it when they're employing   thousands of people but we don't love   our companies when they leave and go to   another country and think they can make   their product and sell it back into our   country like we're a bunch of fools like   they've been getting away with for the   last 35 years not going to do it no   they're going to be consequences when   they want to leave I wish him well I   always say enjoy your new plant enjoy   the very hot weather but if you think   you're going to be coming through what   will soon become a very very strong   border now   can happen so easy we're not gonna be   the stupid people anymore folks we're   not gonna be the stupid people because   from now on it's going to be America   first gonna be America first very simple   you know some of the deals made and I've   been studying them actually like reading   deals do you believe this I don't know   what that is but I've been selling some   of these deals are horrible they're   inconceivable but we're gonna have some   great through strength we don't want to   use it it's got to be there it's got to   be there at the same time we will ensure   our veterans have the best medical care   in the world including the best health   care for our female veterans who have   also been the Forgotten people got a lot   of Forgotten people in this country a   lot of Forgotten people you'll be very   strongly focused on female veterans who   have really had it tougher than almost   anybody on child care thank you that's   very nice on child care I'm asking   Congress to pass legislation to make   safe and affordable childcare accessible   to all while fighting to get higher pay   for women women in the workforce that's   what has to happen and ensuring   women-owned small businesses can access   the capital they need we're going to be   working on plans for companies not only   will but for companies to access the   capital from banks right now there is no   capital you can't get a loan and we will   open it up and you'll be able to get   loans and you're going to do great we're   going to hire a lot of people and you're   going to expand your businesses it's   going to be a beautiful thing going to   be a beautiful thing has to happen   so many people can't get jobs the   unemployment number as you know is   totally fiction if you look for a job   for six months and then you give up they   consider you you give up you just give   up you go home you say darling I can't   get a job   they consider you statistically employed   it's not that way but don't worry about   it because it's going to take care of   itself pretty quickly we want to support   every young woman in America who dreams   of starting and owning a small business   because that dream has not been a dream   for the last long period of time on   health care reform and I want to tell   you and I want to thank the women cuz I   kept hearing for months I'm not gonna do   well with women I kept saying why what's   wrong with women I think women are like   I said I'll trade the men for the women   right I'll trade them and I wanted them   and then we had the election I did great   with women I let in many categories and   every time we would have a rally I'd   have those beautiful pink signs up right   women for Trump women for job then I go   home I turn on a television to see how   massive my crowd was and you'd never   show it there they'd never show but they   talk about women guess what we did great   with women african-american the   african-american communities   unbelievable much much more than in the   past for other people I heard that was   going to be off and it was fantastic   plus a lot didn't go out and vote for   Hillary   in all fairness Hispanic community   incredible   now with the males I set records but who   cares right   who cares about the mails I'd like to   switch it I'd rather set the records   with the women but we did very well with   women we did well with all groups I'll   tell you where we really did well an   all-time world record not even close   evangelicals I love you   evangelicals we had such great help the   pastors the ministers we had such great   out and I won't go into great detail but   we will get rid of the Johnson amendment   okay   I promise you that the Johnson amendment   a disaster on health care reform every   day the law known as Obamacare is   destabilizing our health care system   surging premiums and forcing providers   out of the market they're out of the   market nobody to talk to nobody to talk   to if we don't act quickly the damage   will be irreversible and our country   can't afford it not only can't you   afford it our country can't afford it   that's why we will and must repeal and   replace Obamacare we have no choice   you know premiums in some states great   state Arizona another one I won by a lot   that I was supposed to be like really   close but he states I mean at the   beginning of the evening I'm saying this   is like a lot of fun but Arizona was   great to me but Obamacare is up a   hundred and sixteen percent hundred and   sixteen percent it's going much higher   so we're going to get that taken care of   one crime the murder rate has   experienced its largest increase in   forty five years   we're going to support the incredible   men and women of law enforcement   and we are going to bring this terrible   crime wave to an end on immigration we   will build the wall and we will put an   end to illegal immigration and stop the   drugs from pouring into our country the   drugs are pouring into our country   poisoning our youth and plenty of other   people we will stop the drugs from   pouring into our country we will stop   the drugs from poisoning our great and   beautiful and loving youth   okay we do it   and we have a man that we'll be   introducing pretty soon next week who is   going to do a phenomenal job called   homeland security used to be a political   appointment now it's like the most   important point appointment and he's   going to do a terrific job and he and   his people are going to keep you safe   they're going to keep you safe not going   to be games these are no longer   political appointments these are   talented people smart people where they   have to be they're tough people is it   okay to have some tough people win you   know because the enemy is tough right I   think the enemy is pretty tough right so   I think we need some tough people but we   have smart people and great people   during this campaign I had a chance to   meet the incredible family of Sarah root   and Iowa native killed at the age of 21   by an illegal immigrant who is released   from custody two separate times a trump   administration will stop the violence   that is spilling across our border and   believe me you've seen now it is   unbelievable how much there is and we   will fight to protect every last   American life and life and life during   the campaign I also spent time with   American workers who were laid off and   forced to train the foreign workers   brought in to replace them we won't let   this happen any war   can you believe that you get laid off   and then they won't give you your   severance pay unless you train the   people that are replacing you I mean   that's that's actually demeaning maybe   more than anything else and you know the   name of one of the companies that's   towing and I won't I'm gonna be nice   because we're trying to get that company   back   don't forget much harder when a company   announced a year and a half ago some of   these companies like carrier they   announced long before I even knew I was   gonna be running for president by the   way you'd land I ran for president I   think say what that the movement it's a   movement but that's a lot it's very hard   to tell somebody we don't want you to   leave we don't want you to go to Mexico   wherever you're going and they say but   sir we've already built our plant that's   not a great position and yet we still   kept so many of those workers so that   was a good job and I'll tell you our our   governor who will soon be our vice   president Indiana become Indiana Mike   his he is a great guy it's one of my   great decisions he's a friend of mine   but he's a great guy hasn't he done a   good job Mike Pence   he's done such a good job one of my   first executive orders will be to ask   the Department of Labor to investigate   all these abuses that undermine jobs and   wages for the American worker to protect   our country from terrorism and extremism   we will suspend immigration from regions   where it cannot be safely processed or   vetted you know I've used the expression   extreme vetting extreme oh it's gonna be   expected we want people coming into our   country we want them coming in legally   but we want them coming and legally but   we want them coming in you know when I   talk about we will build the wall we   will that's going to be doors or big   beautiful doors we're gonna have people   coming into our country but they're   going to come in through a process   they're going to come in Legally and   we're going to see that these people   have true capability to love us to love   us not to hate us to love us earlier   today I visited the campus of Ohio State   University great great place to meet   with the victims of the terrible attack   that occurred only days ago along with   first responders who were terrific one   young man did a phenomenal job saved a   lot of lives our whole nation extends   our prayers it's true that man was young   guy give applause come on you might be   watching   [Applause]   so our whole nation extends our prayers   our support and really our solidarity   because we are solid we are going to be   together we're going to be a strong   strong together nation you know I was   lucky enough to receive the time Person   of the Year they used to call it Man of   the Year but they can't do that anymore   so they call it pres they want to be   politically correct that's okay and they   talked about heads up a divided nation   on the cover to give me this honor then   they'd have to go a little bit of this   stuff a divided a I said I haven't been   president what are you saying that for   but you know what we're gonna bring the   nation together we're gonna bring the   nation together we're not gonna have a   divided nation   and I want to applaud the university   leadership and students for the response   to the attack and their Police   Department really have done a terrific   job and it's Swift life-saving work I   mean they have really been it was   incredible I met him today there were   great people this horrific sizzle is yet   one more tragic reminder that   immigration security is now national   security no more games folks no more   games no more games a trump   administration will always put the   safety and security of the American   people first it's going to be the   American people first it hasn't been   that way hasn't been that way you know   when I look at these trade deals that   I've been studying so much over the last   little while I actually think that they   meant to make them good for other   nations so maybe that was a concept   because I say how could it greement be   so bad is it possible to be so bad I   really believe that they meant to make   it good maybe to help the other nation   but they're killing us are we tired of   this they killing us okay how many of   these can you do so we'll change it   around and we'll get it going and you   see what's going on you see what's going   on on Wall Street it's a beautiful thing   all over the world they're talking about   our country and we haven't even started   yet   right way till we start where do we   start such potential   [Applause]   thank you we want to see apple and we   want to see these great companies start   building plants in the United States   that's what I want to say big plants   their biggest plants ethics reform will   be a crucial part of our 100-day plan as   well we're going to drain the swamp of   corruption in Washington DC funny how   that term caught on is then I told I   tell ever I hated it so what he said   drain the swamp I said oh that's so   hokey that is so terrible I said alright   I'll try it   so like a month ago I said dream this   what place went crazy I said whoa what   since then I said it again then I   started saying it like I meant it right   and then I said it I said loving it and   the place loved it strained the swamp I   mean it's true it's true true Dre the   swamp   I will impose a five-year ban on   executive branch officials becoming   lobbyists and a lifetime ban on   officials becoming lobbyists for a   foreign government   can't do it kento not going to help we   face many challenges but this is truly   an exciting time to be alive the script   is not yet written

will be in   charge your voice your desires your   hopes and aspirations will never again   fall on deaf ears you will be the   captains of your own destiny that's what   happened during this election

MdJWEErbCG8~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161026~Full Speech: Donald Trump Speech at Grand Opening of Trump International Hotel (10/26/2016)~12012.0~4.79787254333~357.0~19.0~   this is an important moment for our   family and our company and it wouldn't   be possible without the hard work and   support of this visionary man so without   further ado let me introduce my father   Donald J Trump thank you   thank you everybody I appreciate it   thank you thank you Milania Tiffany Lara   thank you very much well we're very   proud of our company we've built one of   the great real estate companies of the   world but it seems very insignificant   compared to what we're doing now and as   soon as we're finished cutting the   ribbon i'm off to North Carolina New   Hampshire and back down to Florida right   here we're doing very well with the   notable exception of 1600 Pennsylvania   Avenue this is the most coveted piece of   real estate in Washington DC the best   location I'm honored to be here today to   support my family and especially my   daughter Ivanka for her dedication to   this project she worked so hard I'm also   honored to have a chance to thank the   incredible team of people who brought   our vision for Washington's historic old   post office to life including hundreds   of construction workers electricians   maintenance workers and so many others   who helped make this project a reality   they're really the important ones a   project like this demonstrate what is   possible when a team works together for   a totally common purpose it also shows   how to work with our government and to   get things done my theme today is five   words under budget and ahead of schedule   that's what we did under budget   so important we don't hear those words   too often in government but you will our   agreement with the government required   completion of the project by 2018 we   were dramatically ahead of schedule on   this project and under budget we turned   a property that had been neglected for   decades and which was losing huge sums   of money for the federal government into   a major revenue producer and job creator   this is what I want to do for our   country and this is what we're working   so hard to do right now just about   everything our government touches is   broken or they break it it's always over   budget behind schedule and simply   nothing works look at the Veterans   Administration where new hospitals come   in hundreds of millions of dollars over   budget and yet our brave veterans still   don't get anywhere near the kind of care   they need or deserve look at our   decaying infrastructure look at our   aging military equipment our military is   so depleted despite having the greatest   people on earth I mean they are the   greatest people in our military but it's   so depleted the tax code is broken the   education system is broken we spend the   most for any of any country on education   and we get bad results and so many parts   of our country are in a state of   disrepair and now it was just announced   yesterday that Obamacare is in freefall   with premiums going up massively and   places like the great state of Arizona   going up over one hundred percent in   costs unaffordable unusable and doesn't   work even if you can't afford it the   American people know what this election   is about and they see it every time they   get their health care bills in the mail   box or   I down a highway that's broken we'll go   to an airport that looks like it's from   a third-world country remember Hilary   said herself it was called Hillary care   before it was called Obamacare she made   that statement not too long ago now   she's trying to withdraw that statement   she wants to withdraw that statement so   badly Newt by the way congratulations   Newt on last night that was an amazing   interview he's an amazing we don't play   games note right we don't play games   I've loved my life in business and I've   loved getting to share my dreams with my   family it's an incredible family and   Melania I want to thank you very much   who have been amazing my job is to look   at undeveloped spaces and imagine what   they could be these are spaces that have   no hope have no future but you need   imagination and you need the ability to   get them done and to unlock their   potential and to unlock the potential of   the people working on those spaces and   on those projects and we have so many   things we can do for our country where   others have only dead ends I've dreamed   of the amazing possibilities that we   have that's why government has turned to   me in the past to fix projects that had   gone nowhere that were considered total   disasters whether it's turning a   landfill at very point after many many   years of feudal work in the Bronx New   York into a world-class golf course   that's now open and doing unbelievable   business or revitalizing the facade of   the great grand central terminal or   building and saving wollman rink in   Central Park after eight years of   futility and spending massive amounts of   money and getting it done in four months   for a very small amount of money so many   different things today is a metaphor for   what we can accomplish   for this country same kind of thing this   building is a historical landmark a true   American original it had all of the   ingredients of greatness but it had been   neglected and left to deteriorate for   many many decades it's at they're so   beautiful and so empty and was falling   into a very very bad state of condition   at the foundation for success all of the   elements were here our job was to   restore its former glory honor its   heritage but also to imagine a brand new   and exciting vision for the future to   create a new place for people and   families to come together and a   magnificent place at that I've been very   lucky and I've led a great life now I   want to give back to the country which I   love so much and has been so good to me   I want to go into the inner cities the   poor rural communities and the failing   schools and I want to work on a national   plan of revitalization I'm tired of the   excuses from our politicians I'm tired   of being told what cannot be done I'm   tired of people asking Americans to   defer their dreams to another day but   really what they mean is to another   decade enough waiting the time is now we   can achieve our goals for this country   and we can do so more quickly than   anyone ever thought possible there is   nothing we cannot accomplish the United   States is great it's great it's people   are great there is no task or project   too great there is no dream outside of   our reach don't ever let anyone tell you   it can't be done the future lies with   the dreamers not the cynics and the   critics everywhere I go in this country   all i see is untapped potential waiting   to be set free   and the biggest element of all is our   incredible people the people of this   country they're just waiting they're   waiting and waiting and I think maybe   now their time has come but we will   realize never that the potential we   continue to put in our faith and the   faith of our country and we have to say   the word never will always have to be   taken out because we have such   tremendous potential we have to choose   the most optimistic path we have to   choose to believe not our politicians   that in many cases truly don't know what   they're doing but to believe in   ourselves and in our country if we do   that anything is possible I'm asking   America to join me in dreaming big and   bold and dream for wonderful things in   our future let's close the history books   on the failures in Washington and let's   open a new chapter of success and   prosperity for all of our people we have   a divided nation a seriously divided   nation all of our people that is how we   will truly make America great again   thank you very much I   so we're now going to the lobby this is   a ballroom brand-new this was where the   old shopping center was which was not a   part of the building we made it a part   of the building and this is now the   largest luxury ballroom in Washington   and great we're going into the lobby   we're going to cut a ribbon then I'm   going to North Carolina thank you   you

[Music]   thank you in five days we are going to   win the great state of Florida and we   are going to win back to the White House   just out a few minutes ago the new   rasmussen poll has up three up right now   3 up nationwide we're leading in Florida   we're leading in Ohio we're leading in   Iowa I think we're leading in North   Carolina which is big doing well in   Pennsylvania right there but we are   leading all over I'll tell you what we   are going to have something that's going   to be very special get out there on   Tuesday don't fail who is already voted   by the way that's pretty good it's about   eighty-two percent that about we're on   the cusp of something that's so amazing   its historic change a transfer of power   from a failed political establishment   we're going to return that power to you   the American people   there is more breaking news that I'd   like to share with you right now it was   reported last night that the FBI is   conducting a criminal investigation into   Hillary Clinton's pay-for-play   corruption during her tenure as   Secretary of State in other words the   FBI is investigating how Hillary Clinton   put the office of Secretary of State up   for sale in violation of federal law the   investigation is described as a high   priority its far-reaching and has been   going on for more than one year it was   reported that an avalanche of   information is coming in the FBI agents   say their investigation is likely to   yield an indictment   [Applause]   [Applause]   but just remember the system is rigged   just remember that and reports also show   the political leadership at the   Department of Justice is trying to   protect Hillary Clinton and is   interfering with the FBI's Criminal   Investigation by comparison four-star   general just last week james Cartwright   highly respected is in very serious   trouble for doing a tiny fraction of   what clinton did may go to jail for up   to five years think of it general   Cartwright last week four star general   respected by everybody a tiny tiny   fraction may go to jail for now five   years and general Petraeus's life and   reputation has been destroyed for doing   nothing nothing by comparison to what   hillary clinton did she shouldn't even   be allowed to run for the office of   president   she shouldn't be allowed and that is   where the system is rigged she shouldn't   be allowed it was also reported that the   laptops of Clinton stop aids which had   been slated for destruction were not in   fact destroyed good job by the FBI and   that the FBI has been successfully using   them to gather information for their   criminal investigation further they have   found new emails as part of the six   hundred and fifty thousand emails just   recently found can you imagine 650,000   see what do these people do no wonder   nothing gets done in government 650 then   I guess you'll say those 650 remember   the 33 well the 650,000 also the wedding   and some yoga right finally it is   believed that no less than five foreign   intelligence agencies successfully   hacked into Clinton's illegal and secure   server which contained classified   information creating an ongoing security   threat to the United States think of   what happened to so many people for   doing so little by comparison Thank of   it Hillary Clinton has engaged in a   massive far-reaching criminal conduct   and equally far-reaching cover-up she   created an illegal email server to   shield and guard her activity so simple   so simple should have happened a long   time ago folks now we're going through   phase two which sounds like it's even   worse than phase one should happened in   phase one but she was protected by the   Department of Justice   she illegally transmitted confidential   information and then lied about it to   Congress she illegally destroyed federal   records including 33,000 emails after   receiving a congressional subpoena and   she made 13 phones disappears some with   a hammer who in this room has gotten rid   of a phone and then smashed the hell out   of it with a hammer anybody raise your   hand please raise your hand one hand   over there I see a hand there what   business are you in I want to know I   don't want to know I don't want to I   don't want to meet him she engaged in   corrupt pay for play at the State   Department for personal enrichment she   lied to the FBI and she lied to the   American people many many times remember   she lied 39 times I don't recall I don't   recall well those are all lives because   she recalled every one of them these are   sad events for our country a   high-ranking government official has   been caught selling her public office   threatening national security and   engaging in a massive criminal cover-up   if she were to win it would create   unprecedented constitutional crisis   here we go again with Clinton you   remember the impeachment and the   problems she is likely to be under   investigation for many many years also   likely to conclude in a criminal trial   this is not what we need in this country   folks we need somebody that's going to   go to work to bring our jobs back to   take care of our military to strengthen   up our borders   [Applause]   this is not what we need is going to be   a mess and they say it they say it this   is going to be a mess for many years to   come before they figure it all out we   don't need that we need a president   that's going to go in and do the job   and I just left by the way Miami and in   leavey icy air force one so I said to   myself I wonder who that could be and   it's our president   and he's down here campaigning for   crooked Hillary now why why isn't he   back in the office sometimes referred to   as the Oval Office why isn't he back in   the White House bringing our jobs back   and helping our veterans right why why   isn't he back working he's campaigning   every day and I actually think   considering that she is under criminal   investigation I think he's actually got   a conflict and one of the things that   taught us WikiLeaks he knew she had a   lot of wrong things going on you know   that that also came out Obama knew what   was going on by the way just in case you   didn't know he knew this guy ought to be   back in the office working he's not   going to be there very long thank   goodness but he ought to be back in the   office working   [Applause]   we don't win anymore as our country we   don't win with our military we don't win   on trade this guy able to get back to   the office and stop campaigning if we   win on november eighth we will once   again have a government of By and For   the People real change begins with   immediately repealing and replacing   Obamacare it's just been announced that   the residents of Florida are going to   experience a massive double-digit   premium hike who's got their number yet   does anybody know should I tell you do   you want me to depress everybody you   just put your head down start crying and   leave I won't tell you I don't want to   tell you you know why because if I do   you'll be so depressed I don't like   people leaving a speech early crying   you're not going to like it folks in the   great state of Arizona though as an   example premiums are going up more than   one hundred and sixteen percent and it   doesn't work Obamacare does it work I'm   repealing it we're going to replace it   with something so much better and so   much cheaper Hillary's going to double   up over ninety percent of the counties   in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers   next year think of it good luck in that   negotiation in Minnesota where the   premium increase will be close to sixty   percent the Democratic governor said the   Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable oh did he take heed him and   Bill Clinton did Bill Clinton take it he   said it's crazy Obamacare he said it's   crazy they lied to us the president lied   to his 28 times he said you can keep   your doctor you can keep your plan   remember kept lying and lying and lying   premiums are surging companies are   leaving and shores of fleeing doctors   are leaving and deductibles are through   the roof   sometimes $15,000 in other words you   have to spend fifteen thousand dollars   before you start using it Obamacare is a   total catastrophe yet Hillary Clinton   wants to double down on Obamacare she   doesn't want to terminate it she doesn't   want to get rid of it she wants to   double down making it much more   expensive than it is right now and it's   right now ridiculous chin number one   costs right now bigger than your   mortgage it's bigger than your rent   first time that's ever happened I'm   asking for your vote so we can replace   Obamacare and save health   care for every family in Florida and our   country   so important real change also means   restoring honesty to government Hilary   was given the debate questions in   advance by donna Brazile by the way   can you imagine if those questions   because the dishonest media among the   world's most dishonest people by the way   it's not even a big story mainstream   media hardly covers it they hardly talk   think about it she got the debate   questions against Bernie Sanders   probably got the ones against me too but   we won that debate very easily goes the   base we want those debates I don't care   if she got them except that it shows how   dishonest but think of this supposing I   got the debate questions it would be   front page of the Washington Post it   would be front page of the New York   Times he must immediately withdraw from   the race what he did is disgraceful now   I tell you what they don't even write   about it so Donna Brazile was fired from   CNN that's good but why wasn't she fired   from the DNC because what she did was   totally on it dishonest did you see her   on television the other night she   couldn't answer well where did he get   him where did you get him where did you   get him she's gone that's the question I   was asking them where did you get those   questions where did you get well uh I   got um well I got him I don't know where   I got him I tell you what she should be   fired she should be fired but much more   importantly Hillary Clinton should be   fired Hillary Clinton because donna   Brazile couldn't answer the questions   she look like a fool on television but   she couldn't answer the questions but   you know what was was she took the   questions and gave them to crooked   Hillary I'd get seating and crooked   Hillary instead of saying I'm sorry I   can't accept them we have to report this   incident she took the questions went in   and had good answers for Bernie at some   point does it Bernie Sanders get tired   of it they're calling them all these   names they're cheating on him doesn't he   tell his supporters to go vote for Trump   at some point   right and I haven't seen one story where   Hillary Clinton they blame Donna Brazile   a little bit very little but seriously   can you imagine if it was me that got   those questions you know what I've been   saying they would reinstitute the   electric chair right front page news   front page news she's a very dishonest   person probably the most dishonest   person ever to run for the office of   President I really believe that the   Clintons are the sordid past and someday   they'll start writing about these   dishonest people back there someday they   will ask the question and they will do a   front-page headline why didn't Hillary   Clinton report that she got the   confidential guarded questions to a   debate and someday these dishonest   people are going to write a story about   it in mainstream idiot but we're the   bright future my contract with the   American voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption we understand it I   want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment to hear and heed the words   we all have to say we all of us it's a   lot of us there's a lot of us this is a   movement they've never seen this before   in this country that's why we don't want   to blow it now tell them because you're   allowed to vote early but we don't want   to blow it in november eighth because   this is a movement like they've never   seen before all of them even the ones   that dislike me of which there are quite   a few of those people but all of them   this is a movement like they've never   seen in the country but it will end   quickly it will end quickly if we don't   go out to vote in november eighth so   let's not let it end let's keep it   because we're going to make America   great again folks we're going to make   America great   when we win on november eight we are   going to Washington DC and we are going   to drain the SWA   [Applause]   at the core of my contract is my plan to   bring back our jobs they've been stolen   Florida has lost one in four of its   manufacturing job since NAFTA a deal   signed by Bill Clinton and supported by   his lovely wife Hillary America has lost   seventy thousand listen to that number I   thought it was a typo for weeks have   been saying it seventy thousand   factories since China entered the World   Trade Organization another bill and   hillary back deal we'll get it back   folks don't worry we're living through   the greatest jobs theft in the history   of the world so what it is greatest   thing of it greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world a trump   administration will stop the jobs from   leaving America and we will stop the   jobs from leaving the state of Florida I   can tell you quickly very quick   the theft of American prosperity will   end and we don't mind that it's 115   degrees in this room right the way my it   is hot in this room but you know what   that's okay we lose a couple of pounds   not the worst thing in the world from   now on it's going to be America first a   trump administration will negotiate   NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign   product dumping currency manipulation   and all unfair subsidy behavior which is   a lot we will also immediately stop the   job-killing trans-pacific partnership a   disaster another disastrous potential   deal as part of our plan to bring back   jobs we're going to lower taxes in   American business from thirty five   percent to fifteen percent we will also   cancel billions and global warming   payments to the United Nations billions   and billions of them and use that money   to support america's environmental and   national infrastructure   by the way folks were sending billions   and billions of dollars we're making our   companies non-competitive other   companies are throughout the world are   killing us and other countries don't   adhere to whatever they're supposed to   do but we're sending all of this one   here's what we want we want crystal   clean water we want immaculately clean   air and we want great safety above that   folks let's go to town and let's employ   a lot of people   [Applause]   we're going to spend a lot of money on   our infrastructure including the   deepening which you need of the harbor   at jack port do we all know jack boy we   will become a rich nation once again but   to be a rich nation we must also be a   safe nation in chicago 3715 people have   been shot since january first think of   that think of that almost 4,000 people   4,000 people have been shot since   January first nationwide murders of   experience their largest single year   increase in 45 years now the press   doesn't tell you that because the press   is guarding Hillary Clinton and the   press doesn't want them and doesn't want   you to know the real facts about you   jobs about all of the things about our   military which is now bogged down in   Mosul remember I said why can't we ever   like go in there quietly secretly and do   the job right mer I said the element of   surprise and they came Oh what is Trump   know about I know plenty believe me   they're bogged down it's a tough   situation

crime wave   it's very substantial every child in   America is the right to grow up in   safety and in peace we will also keep   you safe from terrorism Hillary Clinton   wants a five hundred and fifty percent   increase in Syrian refugees coming into   the country they'll be pouring into the   country that's above Obama's   unbelievable thousands and thousands   coming in her plan would mean   generations of terrorism and extremism   spreading across your schools and your   communities and that's one of the   reasons we have all those women for   Trump signs okay believe me the women

  should they be any different than offer   Mexico will pay for the wall okay   believe me they will pay for it 100%   they might not know it yet but they're   paying for the wall we received the   first-ever endorsement from our ice and   Border Patrol officers they tell us the   border crisis is the worst it's ever   been it's a national emergency the   immigration officers warned in a letter   that Hillary Clinton's plan is the most   radical immigration proposal in US   history and that it will lead to the   loss of thousands and thousands of lives   so they wrote us as Secretary of State   Hillary Clinton allowed many many people   the most dangerous and violent criminals   in the world to go free because their   home countries very intelligently   wouldn't accept them back so we'll take   a killer a drug lord a vicious gang   member bring them back to their   countries and thats a turn that plane   around and get them out of here and   Hillary Clinton State Department would   say oh wow that's too bad oh whoa will   accept them and they go on our streets   and they kill people Hillary Clinton   supports and I guarantee you one thing   in four years or eight years I guarantee   you one thing there won't be one   instance not one where one of these   murderers or drug people or gang members   not one instance folks where that plane   will come back with that person on that   plane   instance Hillary Clinton supports   totally open borders there goes your   country and strongly support sanctuary   cities like San Francisco where Kate   Steinle was murdered by an illegal   immigrant who was deported at least five   times and we're putting very very strong   language in its going to be submitted   the first day I'm in office when they   come in once we deport them when they   come in twice they go to jail for five   years when they come in another one   it'll be ten years and you know what's   going to happen sort of pretty simple   they hear they get caught again they go   to jail for five years guess what's   going to happen they're not coming back   folks now our people don't want to do it   our weak weak politicians don't want to   do that a trump administration will   cancel all federal funding to sanctuary   cities we will end illegal immigration   we are going to stop drugs from pouring   into your communities and poisoning our   youth and everybody else and we will   deport all criminal aliens quickly from   our country we will also repeal the   obama-clinton defensive question and   rebuild our badly depleted military   we're going to rebuild   our Navy is a small it is it have you   heard this I mean to me this is said and   then you wonder why China who's making a   fortune with us they make our product   they take our money and they find I have   a great relationship I made a fortune   with China that the biggest bank in the   world as a tenant of mine in New York   China biggest bank in the world from   China but you know what you know what   they're building right now a tremendous   fortress in the South China Sea that's   supposed to be doing it but they're   doing it because they have no respect   for Obama they laugh at Hillary they   think they think Hillary's a joke she's   a joke she's a joke you know what they   dream they dream they go to sleep it   like these tough leaders you know   they're tough and smart they're smart   and really tough they go to dream at   night they go to sleep and they dream   that hillary clinton becomes president   that's what their dream is I've made a   lot of money with John I'm not sure they   like the idea of me I'll be on but   that's okay and we'll get along great   which other will get along with China   better now I guarantee they won't be   building forts in the middle of see   totally against everything there are   there so what they're doing is such a   big violation but they have no respect   for Obama and they no longer respect our   country our Navy is the smallest it has   been since World War one we will build   the 350 ship Navy that our country needs   and desires and must have   that means brand-new state-of-the-art   ships in places like mayport right here   in Jackson I'm honored and this is a   great honor for me to have the   endorsement of more than 200 top   Admirals and generals and 22 medal of   honor recipients I'm also honored to   have the greatest temperament that   anybody has because we know how to win   she spends a billion dollars she spends   so much money I see these ads people   that know me they say how can they say   that now we have you know what we have a   temperament because we have a certain   temperament it's a temperament of   knowing how to win its knowing how to   win the leaders of our country boy you   talk about temperament and interestingly   whether it's Podesta or Bernie Sanders   Podesta said Hillary has bad instincts   and I'll be honest I've read the things   that birth at that he has said about   Hillary on the WikiLeaks and if I were   Hilary I would fire Podesta so fast he   says such demeaning things about her   she's got bad instincts I mean you've   read some of the things it's incredible   you know how do you have people working   for you and then you have to deal with   them and it was all behind her back he   must be a bad guy i don't know but to   say the things he said about her she   should look at him say Podesta you're   fired but you can't do that she probably   needs him as a witness in the criminal   case so she can't do our new foreign   policy will put America first Hillary   brought death total disaster to Iraq   Syria Libya she empowered Iran and she   unleashed Isis you know she wants to get   rid of Isis she's the one that started   it came through the vacuum now it's in   32 countries and I watch her during the   debate meekly talk about Isis   and I said to you've been here for 30   years Hillary you started Isis you were   secretary of state when it started why   are you going to get rid of it you can't   get rid of anything you don't know what   you're doing now she wants to start a   shooting war in Syria in conflict with a   nuclear-armed Russia that could very   well lead to World War three and   remember Putin is no respect for her   either has no respect for her does it   like her doesn't respect her doesn't   respect Obama and does it like him   Hillary and our failed Washington   establishment have spent six trillion   dollars on wars in the Middle East wars   we never win and now it's in worse shape   than ever before wars we never win folks   they've dragged us into foreign wars   that have made us love and they took us   they opened up our borders you know it's   interesting we fight for their borders   but at home we have open borders try and   figure that one we fight like hell for   their borders we spend trillions of   dollars to do it but at home we have   open borders and they've shipped our   jobs on top of everything and our wealth   to other countries that's going to end   very quickly our jobs are coming back   and our companies aren't leaving and if   our companies want to live there are   consequences if they want to go to   Mexico or some other country build a   plan to make air conditions like   carriers doing or build cars like Ford   is to afford is moving an entire mass of   division down all small car production   they want to do that you tell them very   nicely I'm sorry you know I always joke   that I want to make those calls so badly   I don't want to put anybody in charge of   those goals they're so easy and they're   short and our politicians should have   done this for years but you tell them   that when you make your air-conditioned   your car whatever it might be you build   in Mexico enjoy the weather with that   car or that product comes through our   very strong border now it'll be a very   strong border   there will be a thirty-five percent tax   and you know what's going to happen   nobody's going to lean folks now the   politicians know this but they're all   taken care of by these special interest   groups that want that to happen but   there'll be a thirty-five percent tax   and nobody's leaving and the ones that   do leave that's okay too will make a lot   of money but nobody says it does anybody   say it like Trump right so simple to all   Americans I say it's time for new   leadership just think about what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trump administration we're going to have   the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan   and Hillary is raising taxes very   substantial she's raising your taxes   we're going to eliminate every   unnecessary job-killing regulation we   will cancel every illegal Obama   executive order we're going to rebuild   our military and take care of our great   great great veterans they've never been   taken care of properly 22 suicides a day   not going to happen we're going to take   care of our veterans and I appreciate   all the support I get from the military   there's a big article today on the front   page of the New York done and they say   boy does Trump have support from the   military and by the way and law   enforcement and by military I mean   including big leagues of our veterans   right you know how many veterans are   here right now what now a big big story   the veterans the military and law   enforcement we're going to provide   school choice and we're going to put an   end to common core we're going to bring   our education we are going to support   the great men and women of law   enforcement will go to support   we're going to save our Second Amendment   which is under siege great people you   know we have the endorsement of the NRA   it's great these are great people the   earliest they've ever given and we will   appoint justices to the United States   Supreme Court who will uphold and defend   the Constitution of the United States so   important so a bit it is time to cut our   ties with a failed and bitter politics   of the past Hillary Clinton has been   there for 30 years and she has   accomplished nothing just words and just   made things worse she is a candidate of   yesterday it's gonna be really   interesting to see what happens   terrorism I wonder so let me ask you let   me ask you she shouldn't be allowed to   run based on the email scandals and all   there okay so let me ask you this   question I've never done this before   will justice be done or none will   justice be done yes or no hard right I   don't know I don't know I'm not sure   anybody knows the answer they're   protecting her and it's very unfair so   do you think justice will be done we're   gonna have to see I see the audience   like you're soaking wet or not who knows   we're going to see it's very I tell you   it's very very unfair to a lot of people   and you know what it's very very unfair   to the FBI you want

today you can go vote tomorrow but   get out to vote don't wait till the 8th   get out to vote you know this is a   movement like they have never seen in   our country before I've never seen the   great pundits and frankly some of them   aren't so great but there has never been   a political phenomena like what we're   doing right now and we're all part of it   and we have to finish it off so get out   and vote seventy-five percent of the   american people think our country is on   the wrong track according to all of the   latest falls and we are going to fix it   [Applause]   I love those big Stein's women for drop   I love myself women should say I love   them   we are going to put our country back on   the right track and we're going to do it   quickly to get there we are going to   deliver real change that puts America   first something we haven't been for a   long time they don't put us first   anymore they put other countries first   that take our jobs that take our   companies we're going to stop that very   very quickly   the plan includes and is so important we   are going to transform the tax system of   our country which is a mess we are going   to stop all of the silliness all of the   games all of the dishonesty we are going   to have smart trade policies policies   where we don't lose our job smart energy   policies to create 25 million new jobs   in the next 10 years we desperately need   it and it's going to happen   [Applause]   my plan also includes repealing and   replacing Obamacare a disaster   and in case you haven't heard today's   news it's just been announced that   Americans are going to experience yet   another double-digit spike in your   premium for Obamacare and it doesn't   work   in some areas they're paying sixty   seventy and eighty percent more than   they were paying last year it's over for   Obamacare and Hillary Clinton wants to   double down and make it more expensive   and it's not going to work I called it   when it first came out it's only getting   worse and not only for you for the   country because our country can't afford   it you can't afford it we're going to   have great health care at a fraction of   the course than you watch it'll happen   on top of that over two-thirds of the   counties are losing insurers and if you   look at it all of them they're losing   the insurers and one in five Americans   strapped on Obamacare will only have a   single insurer to choose from and boy   are those insurers going to have a good   time with you it's ridiculous even Bill   Clinton admitted that Obamacare he said   is the craziest thing in the world where   people wind up with their premiums   doubled and their coverage cut in half   and he had a rough night when he went   home that night i will tell you but he   was telling the truth it's one of the   most important reasons why we have to   win on november eighth repeal and   replace Obamacare after win we can't go   on like this you can't in so many ways   but you can't go on like that with   respect to affordable you know the   Affordable Health Care the Democratic   governor by the way of Minnesota set   affordable health care is no longer   affordable which is change has to come   from outside a corrupt and broken system   it is corrupt and it is broken the fact   that the Washington establishment has   tried so hard to stop our campaign is   only more proof that our campaign   represent   the kind of change that only arrives   once in a lifetime this is once in a   lifetime this is our last chance in four   years it's not going to happen it's not   going to happen you got to get out and   vote there's our last chance not going   to happen this is it I'm asking the   American people to rise above the noise   and the clutter and to embrace the faith   and optimism that is crucial and the   most crucial ingredient of the American   character I'm asking you to dream big   once again remember we used to dream big   in this country and imagine all of the   amazing things we can do for our country   real change begins with fixing our   rigged and broken system   [Applause]   this is a big crowd of people this is   something   so straya you ready these people are   among the most dishonest people in the   world the media they are the worst   they're trying to fix the election for   crooked Hillary let them turn their   cameras to see the crowd let them turn   the cameras they never do they never do   it they don't want to show the crowd   they don't want to show the crowd they   don't want to show what's happening they   don't want to show the movement they   don't want to show the crowd so sad look   at that they don't move those cameras   I'll go home my wife will say it sounded   like a lot of people but they never show   the crowd because you know why they   don't because they're dishonest they   don't want to show it now if we had one   of those paid for protesters that you   read about last week you read last week   $1,500 to people to act violent at our   rallies and they got caught then they'd   show the crowd the system is rigged the   best evidence that the system is rigged   is the fact that Hillary Clinton despite   her many crimes was even allowed to run   for president in the first place   [Applause]   so that Hilary bleats and he leadeth   33,000 emails and by the way   sophisticated people people that really   know the internet and this sub said that   never even heard of bleaching because   it's such an expensive process but she   bleached and deleted thirty three   thousand emails lied to Congress under   earth made 13 phones disappear some with   a hammer and then will the FBI she   couldn't remember anything 39 times and   she runs for president right just today   there is shocking new revelations about   how the Clinton campaign has corrupted   our government it was just learned a   little while ago that one of the closest   people to Hillary Clinton with   long-standing ties to her and her   husband gave more than six hundred and   seventy-five thousand dollars to the   campaign of the spouse of a top FBI   official is what   who helped oversee the investigation   into mrs. blends illegal email server so   listen to this so listen to this the FBI   is investigating Clinton for as I would   call her crooked Hillary so their   investigate and actually her best friend   and absolutely closest ally gives   675,000 dollars in campaign   contributions to the woman who's married   to the FBI person who's doing the   investigation no wonder they found   nothing wrong   how does that look how does that work so   designs this represented a large portion   of the money the FBI official spouse had   for the purpose of campaigning this was   a tremendous amount of the money big   proportion we have to investigate the   investigation folks our system is rigged   our system is rigged she never had a   chance of being convicted even though   everybody in this audience and boy do we   have a lot of people everybody here   knows that she's a hundred percent   guilty   you   horrible   [Applause]   more breaking news a former State   Department a to Hillary Clinton just   pleaded just now just leading the fifth   more than 90 times in a sworn deposition   despite being given immunity by the   Obama Justice Department   you know how many people have been given   immunity meaning they're not going to be   prosecuted do you know how many people   tell me 5+1 probably keeps going now   this is our country in terms of Justice   has never reached a lower point than   what we're witnessing today the same had   previously told the Benghazi committee   that he had no knowledge of the server's   existence no knowledge but he did but we   now learn that this aid not only knew   about Hillary's illegal serve but   ordered his employees not to discuss its   existence WikiLeaks also shows how John   Podesta a man who speaks badly of   Hillary and everybody else he's a nasty   guy I don't know but boy he speaks man   he said she has bad instincts but Bernie   said she has bad judgment so what do you   want to put somebody in office who the   top people that know him best they say   bad judgment bad instincts we're going   to make her up president I don't think   so I don't think so   john podesta wreaked opposed by   oversampling he said do this my over   sampling Democrats a voter sabrine you   see this you see it all a voter   suppression technique pota right have   you heard about this just came out   potest is also linked to a major   kremlin-backed firm in Russia under the   way every time rush is brought up this   old truck why do I have to do with it   and now they're like they always like to   say and by the way how would you like to   be she always likes to tie me in with   Russia I have nothing to do with Russia   folks okay i'll give you a written   statement nothing to do but they tie me   into Russia all the time they like to   time you the Russia and they say such   bad things about Putin and then they're   supposed to negotiate with Putin why   would he do this folks we're run by   people that are not smart people or to   putting her to put it a different way to   put it a different way we are run by   stupid people stupid   and remember that Hillary Clinton gave   Russia twenty percent of American   uranium and you know she was paid a   fortune you know they got a tremendous   amount of money but the corrupted media   never talks about these things they   never talk about it the media also   doesn't talk about Hillary's reckless   plans for starting a shooting war in   Syria that would involve a nuclear-armed   Russia she just has bad judgment she   does bad judgment if you look at her   plans to Syria these are the plans of a   child these are the plans of a person   that doesn't know what she's doing but   look what she's done in Iraq look what   she's done anywhere look what she's done   in Libya the level of corruption is so   great Hillary Clinton even got to debate   questions in advance from donna Brazile   she got the debate questions in advance   think of it did you hear this Hillary   Clinton got the debate questions in   advance from donna Brazile   actually knew it was wrong but never   said anything to anyone but use the   questions anyway she's crooked Hillary   folks she knew it was wrong Donna Brazil   is now under pressure but she knew it   was wrong and she should be more guilty   than donna Brazile she took the   questions knew it was wrong went out to   the debate had the answers I mean how   corrupt are we going to get but the   media isn't just against me they're   against all of you that's what it is   like Hillary Clinton they look down on   hard-working people within our country   the media is entitled condescending and   even contemptuous of people who don't   share certain elitist views while the   media politicians celebrated Washington   DC our inner cities crumble innocent   children are shot in the street and   working families who just want to raise   can't even get a job or get a break   Hillary raises hundreds of billions of   dollars from wall street from foreign   governments and from special interests   all the while the people she pretends to   care about struggle and suffer she   hasn't done anything for anybody but   herself believe me   just look at what Clinton and her party   have done to the inner cities and to the   african-american and Hispanic   communities they filled them they   betrayed them and they've abused them   she has abused the african-american   community she has abused the Hispanic   community terrible they want the vote   they get the vote they do nothing and   they say see you in four years just like   when she ran for the Senate in New York   she ran for the Senate in New York she   said she was going to bring back jobs to   upstate New York we lost jobs it's a   disaster area it's a disaster area and   it's sad she lied she lies more than any   human being they've delivered only more   crime poverty and joblessness murders   just experienced their

country where they came from   Hillary Clinton was told that their   country won't take them so she said oh   that's okay bring them back we don't   want to create waves who can blame their   country so they brought it back they put   it back on the streets and that's where   we are now I can guarantee you one thing   whether it's 40 years or eight years   never once will that happen to the   United States when we bring them back   their back   now when you hear about the highest   murder rate in 45 years is a lot of   reasons for it but that's one of them   we're going to suspend immigration from   regions comprised think of this think of   this hard to believe by Islamic   terrorism including the suspension of   the Syrian refugee program   we're allowing thousands of people we   don't know who they are where they're   from we know nothing about them   thousands and thousands are pouring into   our country and crooked Hillary Clinton   wants to allow a five hundred and fifty   percent increase we have enough problems   will be the great Trojan horse the great   Trojan horse next I will work with   Congress to introduce these ten   legislative measures and fight for their   passage within the first 100 days of my   administration they include repealing   and replacing Obamacare a tax cut for   all middle-class families a big one and   by the way Hillary Clinton is going to   raise your taxes substantially you take   a look tariffs on companies that   outsource American jobs the company's   leave they fire their employees we're   not going to let it happen any longer   they call it the greatest jobs theft in   the history of the world greatest jobs   that think of it legislation to provide   school choice which the labor unions the   unions don't want to allow and we're   going to end common core and bring our   education local   going to authorize 1 trillion dollars in   new public-private infrastructure that   is going to be so important projects   that will be fun to include repairing   the herbert hoover dike at Lake   Okeechobee which is affecting everybody   in Florida which has been years and   years when you look at our bridges you   look at our tunnels you look at our   roads and highways you look at our   hospitals and schools we're in bad shape   you know our national debt has doubled   doubled since Obama became president so   it's we've it's gone up 10 trillion   dollars so we're now going to be 20   trillion dollars and a bad factor we   haven't done anything our roads our bed   our schools our bed or highways are   tunnels up bridges are bridges are   falling down you see those reports   they're dangerous many of them so we're   going to get our infrastructure taken   care of it's going to be in jobs but we   have to do it for our country   legislation to immediately begin the   wall and oppose tough penalties   [Applause]   going to build the wall   we're going to build the wall   hundred percent   [Applause]   who is going to pay for the wall one   hundred percent they don't know it yet   but they're painful thousands of   Americans have been killed by illegal   immigrants including Americans like Josh   wilkinson whose mother I've gotten to   know very well through the remembrance   project which is amazing amazing people   Josh a student in a high school   wonderful city loved by everybody was   tortured strangled and beaten to death   by an illegal immigrant and then his   body was set on fire this was somebody   that should have been in the country   they had chances to get him out of the   country but they never acted I've also   met Julie Goldberg whose son Spencer was   shot in the head by an illegal immigrant   Spencer had just dropped his girlfriend   off was driving innocently home and was   brutally murdered by somebody that   should have never ever been in our   country this crime wave ends when I   become president of the United States I   guarantee you I guarantee   we are going to protect our country and   we are going to protect our children   we're going to create tax reach I'll   care savings accounts which is going to   be a basin increase funding for local   police for our military and for our own   good we are going to eliminate the   obama-clinton defense sequester we don't   put the money into our military anymore   at a time when we need it as bad as ever   before the rebuilding of our military   will include major new assets across the   state of Florida including new Navy and   Coast Guard ships to patrol the Seas new   advanced manufacturing on Florida's   Space Coast and new aircraft that will   fly from MacDill Air Force Base and   naval air station pensacola we know that   we're going to set high standards for

Augustine   what a great place great to be back in   Florida I love Florida this is my second   home I'm here all the time and just in   case you haven't heard we're winning not   only Florida but we're gonna win the   whole thing   the new poll that just came out from   investors business daily which was the   most accurate poll from the last three   presidential elections has us up two   points nationwide   what we have is we have a movement like   they've never seen before we have some   very very unhappy people out there the   whole day when they hear this they are   not happy but we're going to take our   nation back remember it we're going to   bring it back it's enough it's enough   you heard where they have two more   hostages in Iran and they're asking for   billions of dollars it's enough early   voting in Florida begins today through   the fifth so make sure you get out and   vote locations include city hall and the   supervisor of elections office you got   to get out there who's voted already   know so bad well you can do it early   because if you're not feeling well on   the 8th of November we don't want to   take a chance but if you're not feeling   well get up and vote who cares right   seventy-five percent of the american   people based on all polls think our   country is headed on the wrong track and   we're going to fix it it's common sense   our country is going to be put back on   the right track and very very quickly   and you're gonna be very proud of your   country again you're gonna be happy   together we're going to fix our rigged   system and deliver real change that once   again puts America first   [Applause]   change has to come from the outside or   whenever really going to understand it   and I will tell you I've been on the   inside and the day i announced june   sixteenth of last year I became a person   on the outside but we have to fix our   country we have to fix our country the   fact that the Washington establishment   has tried so hard to stop our campaign   is only more proof that our campaign   represents the kind of change that only   arrives once in a lifetime and it's true   again there has never been a movement   like this in the history of our country   and even those pundits that dislike me   and dislike you and dislike everybody   they will admit and they do admit they   have never seen anything like this   before and wait'll you see the results   start to come in the results are already   starting we're way ahead in Ohio we're   way ahead in Iowa we're doing great in   North Carolina because people of this   country are fed up with stupidity and   weakness and we can't beat Isis and all   of the problems that we've got going   they're fed up and you know what else   they're fed up with losing their jobs to   other countries all the time the best   evidence that our system is rigged is   the fact that Hillary Clinton despite   her many crimes was even allowed to run   for president in the first place   [Applause]   true   Hillary bleached and deleted 33 thousand   emails lied to Congress under oath made   13 telephones disappear some with a   hammer and then told the FBI she   couldn't remember 39 different times   that the leadership of the FBI and the   Department of Justice let Clinton off   the hook for her crimes against our   nation is one of the saddest moments in   the history of our country and we have   to investigate the investigation folks   just today there are shocking new   revelations which you've seen front page   of The Wall Street Journal about how the   Clinton campaign has corrupted our   government it was just learned that one   of the closest people to Hillary Clinton   with long-standing ties to her husband   and herself gave more this just came out   gave more than six hundred and   seventy-five thousand dollars to the   campaign of the spouse the wife of the   top FBI official who helped oversee the   investigation into mrs. Clinton's   illegal email server   [Applause]   so the man that was investigating her   from the FBI his wife runs for office   and they give her more than six hundred   and seventy-five thousand dollars to run   and it just came out they just figured   it out   we've never had a thing like this in the   history of this country this represented   a large portion of the money the FBI   official spouse had for the entire   campaign a big big percentage it's   absolutely disgraceful it's absolutely   terrible and it's unbelievable how   Hillary Clinton got away with the email   I the email scam the email corruption   but now at least we have a pretty good   idea and general Cartwright a four-time   of for think of this a four-star general   highly respected just at the end of last   week struck a deal he lied one time to   the FBI and he said he did that for   national security reasons highly   respected man four-star we're talking   about a four-star general and he's going   to go to jail perhaps for as much as   five years and that's a tiny fraction   that's a tiny fraction of what Hillary   Clinton did so the fact that she is even   allowed to run means our system is   rigged she never had a chance of being   convicted Hillary knew this money was   being paid and she has to be held   accountable for this yet another crime   one of so many and she has to be held   accountable cuz she knew that money   675,000 plus was being paid so how is   she allowed to continue to run for   president how is she allowed   you   [Applause]   she gets the subpoena from the United   States Congress asking for her emails   and other records and she bleaches them   and deletes them now bleaching nobody   ever heard of people sophisticated   people in that world that and the reason   it's so expensive to do it so not only   did they delete them they bleached them   and now two weeks ago they find out that   two boxes of emails are missing and you   don't read about that in the New York   Times and you don't read about that in   the other newspapers because the system   is corrupt the system is broken   the system is corrupt folks and I've   been saying that it's rigged I've been   saying it for a long time the system is   rigged WikiLeaks also shows how John   Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling   Democrats a voter suppression technique   and that's happening to me all the time   when the polls are even when they leave   them alone and do them properly I'm   leading but you see these poles with   their polling Democrats house Trump   doing all he's down there polling   Democrats the system is corrupt and it's   rigged and it's broken and we're going   to change   thank you in an email Podesta says that   he wants over samples for our polling in   order to maximize what we get out of our   media polling it's called voter   suppression because people was oh gee   drum set wilt folks we're winning we're   winning we're winning these thieves and   crooks the media not all of it not all   of it but much of it   they're the most crooked they're almost   as crooked as Hillary they may even be   more crooked than Hillary because   without the media she would be nothing   without the media Hillary Clinton would   be nothing   they're disgraceful   [Applause]   just remember that just remember that   without the dishonesty and deceit of the   media Hillary Clinton would be nothing   nothing here's how all of this affects   you when the people who control the   political power in our society can rig   investigations like her investigation   was rigged can rig polls you see these   phony polls and rigged the media they   can wield absolute power over your life   your economy and your country and   benefit big-time by it they control what   you hear and what you don't hear what is   covered how it's covered even if it's   covered at all sometimes I'll have like   these great events and it won't be   covered if there's a little glitch its   front-page news all over the world they   can ship your jobs all over the world   let drugs pour into your care look at   the drugs and a pouring into this area   but all over let drugs pour into your   community and let Congress right   loopholes to benefit a select few and   then you always hear Hillary she's gonna   fight Isis well she's been there for a   long time she and Obama through there in   competence and this guy only does his   campaign he got to go back and trying to   get some jobs for our country all he   does is campaign   we have an incompetent president we have   a president that doesn't know what he's   doing and again take a look at Mosul   they announced four months ago three   months ago we're going into Mosul we're   going to get the leaders of Isis because   they're living in Mosul guess what   twelve minutes later the leaders they   left they're not stupid they left   whatever happened remember the great   generals was called the element of   surprise the element of surprise so now   we're bogged down in Mosul the enemy is   much tougher than they thought they've   had a lot of time to get ready they're   using human shields all over the place   it's a horrible horrible situation   that's going on why did we have to tell   them we're going in why didn't we go in   and then tell the public a week later   congratulations we just got the   leadership we didn't lose many people   I'm telling you folks our leadership I   went to an Ivy League school but there's   some words that you can't describe any   better our leadership is stupid these   are stupid people   so bad these are stupid stupid people   and they're leading us right down the   tubes the corrupt system can also force   brave National Guardsmen from California   to return the bonuses they were promised   something that would never happen under   a trump administration how about that   one these people we want your money back   that we gave you years ago this can only   happen with these incompetent people we   have running and people with no common   sense they're incompetent but they have   no common sense they have no common   sense while the median politicians   celebrated Washington DC our inner   cities crumble innocent children are   shot in the street and working families   who just want to raise can't get a break   the media isn't just against me they're   against all of you that's really what   they're against they're not against me   they're against what we represent like   Hillary Clinton they look down on the   hard-working people of the country   that's what's happened the media is   entitled condescending and even   contemptuous of the people who don't   share their elitist views and this is   all for money this is for money largely   money and power I see you and I hear you   I am your voice remember remember   I was on the other side of this equation   for a long time it was very comfortable   it was a very good side but then I   decided that you know i'll tell you the   bottom line i love our country and we   were going bad we were going man   [Applause]   I will never let you be the Forgotten   people again with the Forgotten people I   will never let you down I promise I will   never ever let you down when we win your   voice will boom through the halls of   Washington and will be heard all across   the world this is bigger than brexit   what's going on this is bigger than   breakfast   and folks get out and vote leave here   and vote leave here and vote or we have   wasted a hell of a lot of time energy   and in my case a lot of money I'm not a   politician and I never wanted to be a   politician believe me I ran because this   country has been good to me I love   America I could not stand by and watch   what was happening to our great country   I didn't want to do it my only special   interest is you the American people and   we're going to solve the riddle of   what's going on in Washington it's time   to clean up our nation's capital that's   why I proposed the contract with the   American voter it's a set of promises   for what I'll do in my first 100 days it   includes getting rid of immediately   Obamacare which is a disaster   even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is   the craziest thing in the world quote   craziest thing of the world where people   wind up with their premiums doubled and   their coverage cut in half now he may   have had a tough evening when he went   home but that's right and she wants to   make it far worse she wants to double   down she wants to make it bigger it's   going to destroy the American family and   it's destroying American business   especially small business but you know   what else it's not working it's no good   it's terrible health care it's and you   know your numbers are so crazy you   really can't use it your deductibles is   so hot you'll never get to use it it's   just one more reason why we have to win   on November my contra   with the American voter begins with a   plan to end the rampant government   corruption and put the special interests   out of business we're going to do it I   understand it I understand it I   understand it very well I want everyone   in Washington to hear and to heed the   words that we all say together if we win   on november eighth we are going to drain   the swamp in washington DC we're   draining the swamp   [Applause]   under my contract on my first day in   office my administration will   immediately pursue the following six   measures to make our government honest   once again first a constitutional   amendment to impose term limits on all   members of God second a hiring freeze on   all non-essential federal employees and   that does not include the military   believe me third a requirement that for   every new federal regulation to existing   regulations must be eliminated   regulations are putting us out of   business fourth a five-year ban on White   House and congressional officials   becoming lobbyists after they leave   government service they're making a   fortune they control government fifth a   lifetime ban on white house officials   lobbying on behalf of a foreign   government how simple and six a complete   ban on foreign lobbyists raising money   for American elections on the same day I   will begin taking the following seven   actions to protect American workers our   jobs are being stolen the single   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world that's what's happened to our   country because of our politicians and   in some cases it's not just lack of   intelligence it's not just stupidity in   some cases it's because they're getting   so much money from donors and special   interests that they want to do it they   don't care about our country first I   will announce I love you to my attention   to renegotiate NAFTA the worst economic   trade deal ever signed in the history of   the world also or withdraw from the deal   that will start something that's gonna   be much much better second I will   announce our withdrawal from the   trans-pacific partnership a disaster a   disaster third I will direct my   secretary of the Treasury to label China   a currency manipulator they are they   know I have a great relationship with   China I've made a lot of money with   China but you know what they know they   told me that's how they do it it's a   single greatest tool they have currency   manipulation and their grandmasters they   do a great job I congratulate them I'm   not angry at China I'm angry at our   country for allowing them to do it okay   I'm not angry charlie fourth I will   direct the Secretary of Commerce and you   are straight representative to use every   tool under American and international   law to end foreign trade abuses that   hurt the American worker of which there   are many things fifth I will lift the   restrictions on the production of shale   oil natural gas and clean oil we we will   also put our miners back to work and we   will develop clean coal our miners have   been treated badly clean coal sticks   approve idle energy infrastructure   projects like the Keystone pipeline a   lot of jobs a lot of good things seven   cancel billions in payments to UN   climate change programs now think of   this   we pay billions and use the money to fix   America's water and Environmental   infrastructure not throw it out the   window additionally on the first day I   will take the following five actions to   restore security and the constitutional   rule of law and I just met with your   great sheriffs and your great law   enforcement people and your firefighters   your first responders these are great   people these are great people first   cancel every unconstitutional executive   action or executive order memorandum   issued by president obama   where are he and Michelle campaigning   today where are they would you rather   see them like in that White House   figuring out how to knock the hell out   of Isis wouldn't you rather have them in   the White House like working hard so   that Mexico stops stealing our companies   and therefore our jobs wouldn't it be   great would it be great if they could   come up with a great health care program   instead of one way your numbers are 70   80 even ninety percent more than they   were just recently you know you have   increases in Obamacare that are going   through the roof it's out of control by   the way just so you understand it's a   dead program it's unaffordable Hilary   wants to throw more money at it to keep   it going it's a dead program and it's   putting our businesses out I'd love to   see him in the White House working   instead of campaigning for crooked   Hillary Clinton happy on   [Applause]   remember what he said Donald Trump will   never win the Republican primary he will   never do that sorry sorry you will never   win   the Republicans will never do that well   they did it sorry and what happened we   got the most votes in the history of the   Republican primary system over 14   million row 42 states second begin the   process of selecting replacement for   Justice Scalia great man from one of the   20 judges on my list who will uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   States third cancel all federal funding   to sanctuary cities   how bad is that   fourth begin swiftly to remove all   criminal aliens from our country   so we have many illegal immigrants in   our country who are criminals convicted   criminals murderers drug lords gang   members and what happened during Hillary   Clinton's stay during the her Secretary   of State days people would take him out   cuz I'll tell what these border patrol   agent and ice agents they're great   people they want to do the jump but   they're not they're told stand back but   these were bad and that bring them back   to their country and very intelligently   because they know who they're dealing   with they say we don't want them they   don't want drug kingpins they don't want   murders and gang members so they'd say   turn around we're not accepting them so   they turn around and then say Madam   Secretary they won't accept them oh   that's okay let's let them out on our   streets and we have that we have that   and I promise you one thing during my   presidency there will not be one   instance where those countries don't   take these people back not one   5th to spend immigration from tara prone   regions we're vetting cannot safely   occur including the suppression of the   Syrian refugee program which Hillary   Clinton wants to expand by five hundred   and fifty percent over the thousands and   thousands of people that are already   coming in we know nothing about them   that'll be the next great Trojan horse   you watch watch what happens next I'll   work with Congress to introduce the   following legislative measures and fight   for their passage within the first 100   days of my administration will get a   pest middle class tax relief and   simplification act we're giving you   massive tax relief for the middle class   with two children as an example would   get a thirty five percent tax cut we   have to the middle class has been   forgotten in our nation we're going to   end the offshoring act that's what it's   called and the offshoring Act   established tariffs to stop companies   from laying off their workers and   relocating to other countries then   selling their product back into our   country with no tax no consequence no   retribution there'll be a thirty five   percent tax and they'll never leave our   country believe me   American infrastructure act 1 trillion   dollars in public private infrastructure   investment our infrastructure is going   to hell our roads our highways are   tunnels are bridges you see the report   on the bridges how unsafe so many   bridges i'm going to start swimming   across rivers and lakes them i don't   want to drive now I mean tremendous   percentages of bridges are they say   virtually ready to fall fall down our   country think of it Obama has doubled   our national debt to 20 trillion dollars   he's added 10 trillion in just seven and   a half years now here's the problem   here's the problem it would be one thing   if the country was in tippy top shape   the roads are beautiful the highways are   beautiful the tunnels the schools the   hospital our country's our mess our   infrastructure is falling apart and we   owe 20 trillion dollars it takes this   kind of a mind to figure that one out   because it's it's a mess   this means helpful projects like the   first coast express would you like the   first ghost expressway school choice and   education Opportunity Act gives parents   the right to send their kids to the   school of their choice choice choice   it's great choice is important and we're   going to end common core and bring   education loka   then we have one that at least a few of   you will like it's called the repeal and   replace Obamacare act what ages asked by   the way I just left the farmers West   Palm Beach farmers beautiful farmers   great people and they said that   Obamacare is destroying their business   destroying their business they can't   afford it they don't even know how to   account for it they have to hire   consultants just to fill out forms it's   so complicated it is so down there so   discouraged and the same thing happened   in Iowa the same thing happened in New   Hampshire everywhere I go people are   despondent over it actually worse than   our high taxes worse than our   over-regulation which is killing us also   by the what's killing our businesses   Obamacare is a catastrophe that she   wants to build bigger and better but   better means more expensive it's going   to get worse under Hillary Clinton it's   going to get worse and don't forget   she's got a lot of people that gave her   money that want Obamacare to continue   just remember them still fully repeal   Obamacare and replace it with   patient-centered reforms that are   totally affordable and much better so   we'll have better health care at a much   lower price affordable childcare and   Elder Care Act allows Americans to   deduct child care and elder care from   the taxes and creates tax-free dependent   care savings accounts for all american   families and this one i tribute to   Ivanka Trump has anyone ever heard of   him   she feels so strongly about it and I   agree and illegal immigration act   thousands of Americans have been killed   by illegal immigrants including   Americans like Josh Wilkerson whose   mother I've got to know during the   campaign an incredible woman who suffers   every day Josh a student in high school   was tortured strangled and beaten to   death by an illegal immigrant and then   his body was set on fire I've also met   Julie and you have to see that the   family of Josh its I said this time make   it better she actually said time in a   certain way makes it worse makes it   worse this was somebody that should have   never been in the country should have   been thrown out of the country and   nobody acted and I should be alive we're   gonna build the wall don't worry about   it don't worry about don't even think   about it don't even think about don't   even think about it   I've also met and gotten to really like   Julie Gove up whose son Spencer was shot   in the head by the illegal immigrants   Spencer had just

of dollars doing this lots   of time lots of energy spending my money   but I'm fighting for you Hillary Clinton   is a throwback from yesterday our   campaign is about creating a new   American

Americans Republicans   Democrats independents liberals   conservatives who turn on television   every night and don't see anyone   speaking up for them the forgotten man   the forgotten woman   this campaign is about giving a voice to   those who don't have one I am your voice   I am your voice   I understand the great responsibility   you have and especially the   responsibility you've placed in me and I   will never ever let you down once again   it will be a government of By and For   the People   let's talk about what my reform agenda   will mean for the citizens of virginia   and i have to say i love this state i   have businesses in this state that great   businesses and we're going to take care   of this state and we're going to take   care of this country but first let's   talk about our amazing veterans veterans   the Commonwealth of Virginia is home to   about 800,000 veterans who have served   bravely our country to all veterans here   tonight and across this nation thank you   very much thank you thank you we will   never let you down we will never let you   down government is letting you down very   badly right now we are never ever going   to let our great veterans down the Obama   Clinton administration has betrayed our   veterans and it's betrayed them very   badly veterans are dying waiting for a   simple care they're dying online waiting   to see a doctor five days six days seven   days it all ends and it in fast under a   trump administration   I have a detailed ten-point plan on   Veterans reform available on my website   which everybody is talking about at the   veterans love check it out at the center   of the plan is veterans Choice the VA   will remain a public system because it   is really a public trust but veterans   will have the right to either she care   at the VA facility and if they can't get   it and get it quickly they have the   right to go to a private doctor or   medical clinic across the street and   we'll take care of them   [Applause]   never again will we allow a veteran to   die waiting for the care that they need   and they should be getting more than   anybody a trump administration will also   rebuild our sadly depleted military   sadly the play doh the best way to keep   our troops out of harm's way and to keep   our nation out of preventable conflicts   is to remember those famous words very   very famous words peace through strength   [Applause]   unfortunately our active-duty armed   forces have shrunk from 2 million in   1991 to 1.3 million today a big big   reduction the Navy has shrunk from over   500 ships to 272 shifts during the same   period of time think of that so sad the   Air Force is about one third smaller   than it was in 1991 President Obama   has proposed a 2017 defense budget that   in real dollars touch nearly twenty-five   percent from what we were spending in   2011 we faced threats as never ever   before but the Obama Clinton   administration is determined to keep   shrinking our military until you know   what ultimately is going to happen and   it's not going to be good that I can   tell you president Obama has said that   he thinks the greatest threat we face is   global warming   remember President Obama and Hillary   Clinton sometimes referred to as crooked   Hillary can't even say the words radical   Islamic terrorism can't even say they   don't want to get involved everybody   knows what's happening they can't say   the words now while President Obama and   Hillary Clinton are shrinking America's   military they're also expanding think of   it expanding through allowing it to   happen the military of Iran   they're doing this with their disastrous   deal that puts Iran on the path to   nuclear weapons and gives them another   150 billion dollars not to mention the   four hundred million dollars in cash   which turned out to be a ransom payment   after all just like I said in other   words our president lied to us he lied   to us but you also not forget that   Hillary Clinton's disastrous Middle East   policies unleashed Isis onto the world a   fact for which Hillary Clinton has   expressed zero remorse and no apologies   she will never be able to fix the ISIS   problem that her policies created for   one thing she doesn't have the strength   or the stamina coupled with all of the   other problems that this country has and   we have a lot yet as our military was   depleted on Hillary Clinton's watch   things turned out really well for her   and only her the Clintons made 60   million dollars in gross income while   she was Secretary of State   plus countless more to the phony Clinton   Foundation it's called pay for play   she even created an illegal private   email server one easily hacked by our   foreign enemies to hide her corrupt   dealings then   [Applause]   then she deleted 33,000 emails to try   and cover her tracks these were the   emails for the wedding and for yoga   classes thirty-three thousand emails   would we like to see what was on those   emails she lied about it all even to   Congress a trumpet administration will   end the government corruption once and   for all   no one will be above the law let's talk   about another major issue right here in   Virginia it's called energy energy i   visited the hard-working coal miners in   the state and they are hardworking and   they love being coal miners and that's   what they want to do their tremendous   hard-working people who only want to be   able to do their jobs provide for their   families and give power to this country   we are going to put our great miners and   steel workers back to work   but Hillary Clinton wants to put them   out of a job   [Applause]   you know her statement made not so long   ago wants him out of a job let's repeat   her infamous words because this is   exactly what she said put a lot of coal   miners and coal companies that employ a   lot of people folks a lot of people and   a lot of people right here in Virginia   put them out of business out of business   that's what she wants it   so sad according to the energy   information administration the United   States has the largest recoverable coal   resources in the world we're talking   clean coal beautiful clean call these   reserves are located in Virginia West   Virginia Kentucky Pennsylvania and   Illinois to name a few examples over   ninety percent of us call is used for   electricity in other words my plan will   make your energy bill much less   expensive much much cheaper Hillary   Clinton's anti-energy agenda is a   massive tax on the poor it's also a   massive tax on the people of Virginia   and the people of our country in January   2016 the Obama administration announced   a moratorium on new coal leases on   federal lands this comes on the heel of   many other anti-coal regulations from   the Obama administration Virginia the   largest exporter of coal in the United   States will be crushed by these Obama   Clinton policies Christ it's going to   have a huge negative impact on Virginia   thanks to Obama Clinton agenda call   experts from the port of Virginia the   largest port for coal expectation you   know that the largest they export more   than any other place tremendous number   of jobs largest in the country have   declined significantly in fact at record   numbers over the last three years soon   you won't have any jobs Virginia has   seen a stunning seventy percent decline   in coal jobs since 1990 Hillary Clinton   will finish the mining industry off   for good there will no longer be an   English and we're not going to let that   happen not gonna let according to the   heritage foundation by 2030 the   obama-clinton energy restrictions will   eliminate another half a million   manufacturing jobs reduce economic   output to 2.5 trillion dollars and   reduce incomes by seven thousand dollars   per person meaning you're going to be   making a lot less money years from now   then you make right now a trump   administration will end the   obama-clinton war on the American worker   we will unleash an energy revolution the   likes of which we have never seen before   according to the Institute for energy   research lifting the restrictions on all   sources of American energy will do a lot   of things number one increase GDP by   more than 100 billion dollars annually   money we desperately need and over   500,000 new and high paying jobs   annually increase annual wages by more   than 30 billion dollars over the next   seven years think of that increase   federal state and local tax revenues by   almost six trillion dollars over four   decades increase total economic activity   by more than 20 trillion dollars over   the next longer period of time doesn't   that sound good to you folks doesn't   that sound good   Hillary Clinton will make America poor   you're going to lose your jobs you're   going to lose your wages you're going to   lose your medical Obamacare is a   catastrophe you're going to lose   everything I want to make America   wealthy again another industry of huge   importance to the state and country is   agriculture especially in Virginia   [Applause]   farmers are the backbone of America we   have a lot of farmers here lata farm a   lot of jobs agriculture and forestry   combined provide over 400,000 jobs right   here in the Commonwealth and I have one   of the largest wineries on the East   Coast in Charlottesville   provide a lot of jobs at that winery and   it's doing great business but the   massive regulations and EPA   interventions from the Obama Clinton   administration have devastated America's   farmers agriculture and forestry workers   they'll all be looking for jobs you're   not going to be able between taxes and   regulations and environmental controls   many of which are not necessary it's   devastating to the farmer devastating   Hillary Clinton supports every last   job-killing Obama regulation and wants   to go much much further the farms will   be closed she wants to put the farmers   out of business just like she wants to   put the miners and steel workers out of   business and we're not going to let it   happen we're doing the opposite in fact   Hillary Clinton's 1.3 trillion dollar   tax hike would raise taxes on family   farms to as much as nearly fifty percent   more than they're paying now fifty   percent   she even wants to tax them again at   death by as much as forty five percent   the death tax and the death tax is a   very very big weapon and war on farmers   a trump administration will be pro   agriculture one hundred percent I just   announced the new members of my AG   Raquel chur Advisory Committee and they   include Virginia's very own congressman   Bob Goodlatte where's Bob he's around   here someplace together we're going to   work on reforms to support our family   farms and boost agricultural production   in America to record levels will be   exporting our product we will be so   proud of what we're doing again   [Applause]   that begins with hiring a pro farmer   pro-american energy head at a very very   destructive EPA   it also means i am going to eliminate   the destructive and invasive waters of   the United States rule that was   unilaterally issued by this   administration and that is a job killer   like never before this room is so   extreme it gives federal agencies   control over creeks and small streams   even puddles on your private property   you can't do business anymore I'm also   going to cut taxes for family farms down   to fifteen percent from thirty-five   percent on top of that we are going to   end that death tax on family farms which   has truly really and I mean really hurt   this great American industry and frankly   family farms manufacturing you can look   at any industry we want American   business tax will be cut from thirty   five percent to fifteen percent and new   jobs are going to flow into our country   again   then by unleashing American energy   including clean calls we are going to   make it easier and cheaper and less   expensive to produce saving money we are   going to produce like never before   saving money for consumers all the way   up and down the line this will give   America the competitive edge it   desperately needs we are losing so badly   to other countries our jobs are gone   everything's gone everything's gone it's   going to change and it's going to change   fast finally on the subject when we   negotiate trade deals we will make sure   that they are going to be fair and   balanced no more one-sided trade deals   where we open our markets but they close   their markets   not anymore no more trade deals where we   can't get our product into their country   but they can dump all the product they   want in two hours no more another issue   I'd like to address briefly today is   very important to everyone to this state   it's called law and order   I was honored to meet today with safford   County sheriff's deputy Brandon Boyle   who sustained five gunshot wounds the   summer in the line of duty and by the   way let's give a great big hand to our   police and law enforcement   I want to thank all of those in our   police departments all over the country   in law enforcement generally for the   unbelievable job they do thank you we   thank you and I mean this from the   bottom of my heart everybody else says   we thank you and we are standing with   you and I am very proud I have to say to   have the support of almost that i know   of almost the entire law enforcement   community so important   [Applause]   so we're talking about a lot of   different transactions going on Hillary   Clinton is banking on her friend Terry   McAuliffe on getting thousands   a violent felons to the voting posts in   an effort to cancel out the votes of   both law enforcement and crime victims   they are letting people vote in your   Virginia election that should not be   allowed to vote   that is sad so sad at the same time   Hillary Clinton wants to essentially   abolish the Second Amendment for   law-abiding Americans   she wants to overturn the Supreme Court   ruling that affirmed the Second   Amendment as a private right so that any   city or state of this country can ban   private gun ownership   the NRA endorsed me they gave me the   earliest endorsement they've ever given   we will save the Second Amendment and   appoint judges who will protect your   freedom   [Applause]   we will appoint great great justices for   the Supreme Court of the United States   one more issue central to law and order   is having a secure immigration system   failed governor and he was a failed   governor Tim Kaine   whose watch during remember this during   his watch Virginia's unemployment rate   more than doubled add his first his   first move as the governor of the state   was to raise taxes by four billion   dollars first week   he also oversaw a huge increase in   illegal immigration a tremendous   increase and remember what I said tim   kaine proposed nearly a 4 billion dollar   tax increase and that's what they're   going to be doing to you again it's a   tax increase on purpose it's what's   gonna happen she's already said it   massive tax increases for everybody and   you had a governor who did it in his   first week a governor who wasn't even   popular with the people of Virginia tax   increases bringing in lots of   immigration and he didn't even know what   he was bringing in so people earning as   little as seventeen thousand a year had   to pay more tax over all the illegal   immigrant population in Virginia has   nearly tripled since 2000 putting   enormous pressure on schools and public   services nearly tripled it's getting   worse now we're going to build a wall   don't worry we're gonna build the wall   we're going to build the wall   [Applause]   [Applause]   we're going to build the wall and Mexico   is going to pay for the wall believe me   100   believe me and that'll be very easy that   will be very very easy politicians think   we're joking we don't joke we don't joke   this is a movement this is a movement   and movements don't joke believe me it's   getting worse now as thousands of recent   border crossings are being relocated to   the state of Virginia   and you don't know who they are you   don't know where they come from even   your government officials know nothing   about them for the most part you have no   idea what's going on and our president   and Hillary Clinton they don't have a   clue we have got to be so smart so tough   and so vigilant or when I can have a   country anymore folks the people hurt   most by our open border are low income   hispanic and african americans who are   competing for jobs and community   resources against new arrivals our open   border is also being used as a   recruiting tool for criminal gangs   creating a growing gang problem right   here in the state of virginia where   large numbers of gang members are in our   country illegally right here in the   state of virginia   we are going to end this chaos and   restore peace law and order to our land   finally today I'd like to address an   issue of great and very deep personal   importance to me in recent days across   this country I've asked the African   American community to honor me with   their vote   I fully recognize the outreach to the   african-american community is in an area   where the Republican Party must do   better and it will do better the GOP is   the party of Abraham Lincoln and I want   our party to be the home of the African   American voter once again I want a   totally inclusive country and I want an   inclusive party we reject the bigotry of   Hillary Clinton who sees people of color   only as votes not as human beings worthy   of a better future we've seen what the   Democratic policies have done in cities   like Detroit Baltimore Chicago and many   many more virtually all of your inner   cities are totally run and controlled by   Democrats and they have been for many   many years now Hillary Clinton wants to   make things worse by raising taxes on   2.6 million african-american owned   businesses in this country   my goal is to provide every   african-american child in our country   with access to the ladder of American   success that means good education at a   great paying job it includes also   [Applause]   Thank You education and jobs it includes   also School Choice competition school   choice it means reforming regulations so   young Americans can get the credit they   need to start a small business and that   includes african-americans Hispanics and   everybody else in our country that's   what we need   it means trade and immigration policies   that put American workers at the front   of the line way ahead of the workers of   other countries who are beating us so   badly they're beating us so badly   Hillary Clinton's amnesty plan will give   jobs benefits and Social Security to   millions of people here illegally at   taxpayer expense and many of these   people   and many of these people are treated   better than our vets are treated that is   not going to happen   on top of that according to the US   Senate immigration subcommittee her plan   would bring six hundred and twenty   thousand refugees in her first term   alone   [Applause]   from Syria not going to know who they   are and where they came from could be   the great Trojan horse of all time get   ready get ready she would rather provide   a job to a refugee living overseas than   a young unemployed african-american   youth in Virginia a trump administration   will put American workers first   [Applause]   americanism not globalism will be our   credo   [Applause]   we will bring America together as one   country again united as Americans in   common purpose and common dreams we will   have a thriving economy a strong border   a powerful military a peaceful nation a   rising standard of living this is what I   promise you let's get out there and win   or November a   [Applause]   we are going to win in the state of   Virginia if we win in the state of   Virginia we are going to the White House   and we are going to take care of our   people we are going for victory we must   win or November a together we will make   America wealthy again we will make   America proud again we will make America   safe again and we will make America   great again for each and every American   thank you and God bless you thank you   thank you   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   you

thank you so much what a great honor and   privilege to speak to you today the   American Legion is very very special so   thank you very much   I want to thank commander Dale Barnett   your vice commanders and your   constitutional officers you have all   done such an incredible job the fact is   you are incredible people the men and   women of the American Legion represent   the best absolute best of American   strength courage selfless devotion your   organization and its members have done   so much to defend our country our flag   and to advance the cause of Americanism   not globalism remember America first   America first your one group I don't   have to tell you to remember it all so   you know it we are in your debt very   deeply I will never let you down   [Music]   together we're going to work on so many   shared goals but I want to begin by   discussing one goal that I know is so   important to you promoting American   pride and patriotism in America's   schools very important in a trump   administration I plan to work directly   with the American Legion to uphold our   common values and to help ensure they   are taught to America's children we want   our kids to learn the incredible   achievement of America's history it's   institutions and it's heroes many of   whom are with us today I can tell you   including by the way two special people   mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Senator Jeff   Sessions they're right   [Applause]   we will stop apologizing for America and   we will start celebrating America we   will be united by our common culture   values and principles becoming one   American nation one country under one   Constitution saluting one American flag   and always saluting   the flag all of you helped to protect   and preserve that flag deserves respect   and I will work with the American Legion   to help to strengthen respect for our   flag you see what's happening it's very   very sad   and by the way we want young Americans   to recite the Pledge of Allegiance   in addition to teaching respect for the   flag we also have to make sure we give   our military the tools they need to   defend that flag and to deter violence   and aggression from our foreign   adversaries   there are many we will rebuild our   depleted military and pursue a   state-of-the-art missile defense we will   do it based on those three very famous   words peace through strength   we will make sure our soldiers sailors   airmen and Marines have the best   equipment training tools anywhere in the   world nobody will be able to compete   with us and we will ensure that they   have the best medical care in the world   both in service and when they return   home as civilians   that will require a total reform of the   Veterans Administration it's in very sad   shape I deal with veterans all the time   we have tremendous veteran support and   the stories I hear are so sad we're not   going to have that anymore I've laid out   a 10-step VA reform plan that you can   review on my website here the basis I   will appoint a Secretary of Veterans   Affairs whose personal mission will be   to clean up the VA the secretary soul   mandolin will be to serve our veterans   not bureaucrats not politicians but our   great veterans   I'm going to use every lawful authority   to remove and discipline anyone who   fails our veterans or breaches the   public trust which is what it is it's a   public trust I will appoint the   Commission to investigate all the   wrongdoing at the VA and there's plenty   and then present those findings to   Congress as the basis for reforming the   entire system we're going to get you   fantastic service it's going to happen   believe me   we'll ensure every veteran in America   gets timely access to top-quality care   including the best care in the world for   our female veterans   the Veterans Health System will remain a   public system because it is after all a   public trust but never again will we   allow any veteran to suffer or die   waiting for care that means veterans   will have the right to go to a VA   facility or the right to see a private   doctor a clinic of their choice whatever   is the fastest and best for veterans   people are not going to die waiting   online to see a doctor it's not going to   happen the veteran will be in total   control should I have the honor

NPrw5tVCnSw~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160917~Full Event: Donald Trump Speech at Remembrance Project Luncheon in Houston, Texas (9/17/2016)~41929.0~4.70425128937~1002.0~80.0~   ladies and gentlemen could you please   take your seats we're going to get the   program started I'm going to say a few   words first about a problem that is one   of the most outrageous and dangerous   problems we have in America today and   it's the problem of sanctuary cities I'm   going to briefly outline where sanctuary   cities came from what they look like the   consequences for Americans and most   importantly how we will end sanctuary   cities under a president Trump believe   it or not the first American sanctuary   city started almost 40 years ago it was   Los Angeles in 1979 special order for do   you think of that we've been living   under sanctuary cities for nearly four   decades San Francisco was the next city   to become a sanctuary City it was in   1989 they called it the city of refuge   ordinance boy didn't that sound nice   then New York City the same year in 1989   became a sanctuary city it was called   executive order 124 and it barred New   York City police officers from calling   the eye on us directly and telling them   about illegal aliens they encountered   that order was put into place by Mayor   Ed Koch in 1989 and it was reissued by   mayor's Dinkins Giuliani Bloomberg and   de Blasio now most sanctuary cities fall   into two categories don't ask and don't   tell the don't ask cities are like Los   Angeles and they say they prevent police   officers from even asking a person if   he's an illegal alien even if all of the   evidence points to the fact that he's   talking to an illegal alien the officers   still can't ask don't tell' sanctuary   cities are like San Francisco and they   prohibit the police department from   we've been picking up the phone and   calling ice and saying hey we've got an   a legal alien criminal here we'd like   you to help us by I hope by the way I   hope nobody in this audience is offended   if I use the term illegal alien   you know I use that term because that's   the actual term found in federal law in   federal law the term is illegal alien   but the politically correct left gets so   upset if you use the accurate term they   of course want us to use the alternative   right undocumented immigrant you know I   as an attorney I won't use that term   because that term is legally incorrect   it doesn't even make sense an immigrant   under law as someone who has a green   card so there's no such thing as an   undocumented person who holds a green   card or put it this way it's a   contradiction in terms calling someone   an undocumented immigrant is like   calling a thief an undocumented owner   anyway back to sanctuary City so we had   this huge problem in 1996 you may recall   Republicans took over the Congress and   Republicans in Congress recognized that   this was a growing problem and so they   passed a bill in 1996 that made   sanctuary cities illegal that's right   twenty years ago in federal law these   sanctuary cities are illegally founded   in title eight section 16 33 sorry 1670   1373 and 1644 two different places in   the federal code so problem solved right   Congress made it illegal yeah if only   you know Congress naively thought back   in 1996 that all they had to do was tell   American cities stop it and they would   stop it they never dreamed that these   cities would just break federal law and   just keep on going but that's exactly   what happened and then something else   happened in 1998 the city of New York   sued the federal government and said we   want to keep our sanctuary city you   can't stop us from doing that and   thankfully the city of New York lost in   court in 1998 that was in the Second   Circuit US Court of Appeals so did New   York City get rid of their sanctuary   policy as soon as they lost in court no   they just kept on going so these   sanctuary cities have become a   persistent problem and they have no   intention these city leaders of stopping   their policies and you don't have to be   a lawyer to see what happens when a   sanctuary city goes into place when you   have an illegal alien who is arrested   for a drug conviction or some violent   crime is the phone picked up and caught   as a call made to ice no the illegal   alien goes back onto the streets and so   many families up here on the stage have   had loved ones killed when illegal   aliens are released back onto the   streets now in non sanctuary cities   there's at least a chance a small chance   that that person will be deported but in   sanctuary cities there's no chance at   all and some of the the losses of loved   ones that we're talking about today did   happen in sanctuary cities now in   another problem that happens is gangs   start operating in sanctuary cities   think   if you're a gang member and you want   you're getting to be operating in a   place where your illegal alien members   won't be deported you operate in   sanctuary cities why do you think Los   Angeles has seen such an extraordinary   rise in the number of illegal alien   gangs Mara Salvatrucha 13 the eighteenth   Street gang you probably heard this   figure ninety-five percent of all   outstanding warrants for homicide in Los   Angeles are for illegal aliens but of   course what happens when the police   officer doesn't have enough evidence   that the prosecutor doesn't have enough   evidence to make a conviction and send   that illegal alien to prison in a non   sanctuary City they can at least call   ice and have the guy deported but in a   sanctuary City he's released right back   onto the streets now I want to tell you   a story of a family you all know there's   so many tragic stories here but but this   one just illustrates the legal   ridiculousness of sanctuary cities it's   the case of the bologna family in San   Francisco in 2008 how many to remember   the bologna family so I family is the   family that I personally represented in   court on jun 22nd 2008 anthony bologna   and his three sons were driving home   from a family picnic on a sunday   afternoon after church as they were   sitting in their stopped car another   vehicle driven by illegal alien from el   salvador ms-13 member edwin ramos drove   up he pulled a gun out and he shot just   started murdering the below Nia's in   their car spraying the car with bullets   anthony was killed along with hit two of   his sons Michael and Matthew age 20 and   16 a third son Andrew who's aged 18   survived the incident miraculously but   but saw his father and two brothers   killed in front of his eyes the killer   Edwin Ramos had been in and out of San   Francisco police custody at least three   times for violent crimes not small   crimes serious crimes but every single   time the SFPD was prohibited from   picking up the phone and calling ice and   if they picked up the phone in the case   of this guy ISIL to put him at the top   of the list because he was a gang member   he had multiple arrests for violent   crimes   he would have been out of this country   but instead on the third occasion which   was two months before the killing they   didn't pick up the phone and call ice he   was released back onto the streets and   then this terrible incident happened if   sanctuary if san francis who had not   been a sanctuary city he would have been   either in federal detention or who have   been already on his way back to native   el salvador and those three people would   be alive today and the same can be said   in so many cases if something had been   done to enforce our laws so many of the   loved ones of people here would have   been alive today and so there was a   direct connection between the   enforcement of our laws or the non   enforcement of our laws and the loss of   our loved ones and that has to stop the   losing of our loved ones has to stop   now let me tell you the rest of that   story I met with Danielle Bologna the   widow of Anthony and agreed to represent   her in court we were trying to think of   some way to stop the madness in San   Francisco and we thought well maybe we   can make the city financially   responsible will sue the city and   because the city was knowingly violating   federal law that should help us in a   tort law suit now I won't get into the   legal weeds of it all but the bottom   line is the city claimed sovereign   immunity and that shielded them in   addition the city claimed that   Congress's law against sanctuary cities   was not designed to protect the bolonia   family that's not what Congress had in   mind to which I say what did Congress   have in mind Congress wanted to take   these illegal alien criminals off the   streets but a judge found that no that's   not really what Congress had in mind   whatever that would be Congress wanted   to protect us want to protect the below   Nia's and yet the courts wouldn't let   that intention be found in federal law   so I knew at that point America was out   of options we couldn't sue under this   federal statute the federal statute had   no teeth and the cities were violating   secretary cities with impunity and so   what do we need to do we need to stop   the funds to sanctuary cities   we need a change in the law to help a   future president Trump do just that it   changed it specifically   it changed that when specifically deny   funds to sanctuary cities and I'll tell   you this it shouldn't just be funds   first law enforcement it should be   highway funds as well we can't have safe   roads until we have the illegal aliens   off the roads who are causing so many   deaths so over the past few years there   have been a couple of bills in Congress   to try to do that but they got nowhere   why because there wasn't anyone in the   White House pushing for it with   president Trump in the White House we   will have someone pushing for it and   I'll tell you this too there are some   things that a president can legally do   with his executive authority to start   cutting off those funds even before   Congress acts I know that President   Trump will look for every legal option   he has to stop the money and stop the   sanctuary cities from feeding at the   federal trough   I'm going to wrap it up here but I want   to leave you with a couple of numbers   which you need to know it's not just   about crime it's also about terrorism   did you know that all 19 hijackers on   911 entered the country legally but did   you know that five of the 19 became   illegal aliens while they were here   mostly by overstaying their visas four   of those five were stopped by state   local police for traffic violations and   three of those four were pilots just   think if those police officers had been   able to make an arrest and call the feds   they could have taken the pilots out of   commission sanctuary cities would make   it even more difficult for them to do so   so what mr. Trump is doing is not only   about crime it's about national security   we have to stand behind him we have to   improve the situation we have to end   sanctuary cities in America and I now   want to bring up the rear yes with us   thank you   [Applause]   maria is going to maria's going to   introduce mr. from you all know Maria's   story in 2009 she started the   remembrance project along with tin Ling   or her husband and started the   remembrance project quilt memorializing   the lives of the victims of illegal   aliens and as you also know it is an   organization with nationwide reach with   state coordinators in 28 states and so   if Maria is here Marie would like you to   say a few words to introduce our future   president   [Applause]   [Music]   oh good good afternoon everyone thank   you so much for attending our first ever   remembrance luncheon where we honor and   remember Americans who've been killed by   illegal aliens individuals who should   not have been in the country in the   first place on jun 16 2015 most   Americans probably don't remember that   day but here our families do we remember   that date because that is a day that   Donald Trump announced his run for   president of the United States   [Applause]   [Music]   they're only there is only one candidate   who spoke the truth there is only one   candidate who reached out to our   families are still the life's families   America's most forgotten families there   is only one candidate who embraced and   took in his arms the mothers whose   children were killed innocent victims   and for over 15 months mr. Trump has   traveled all across the United States   and met with our families and listen to   their stories he is also the only   candidate who will support the national   program that our families have put forth   this amazing man is mr. Donald Trump and   I would like for you all to please put   your hands together and give it warm   warm welcome that we are so honored for   mr. Trump to be here with our families   [Music]   Thank You Maria for the introduction is   beautiful and for the work that you and   your organization do to honor these   stolen American lives and that's what   they are stolen American lives and to   advocate for justice on behalf of all   American victims we thank you and thank   you folks would you have to go through   is unavailable I'm honored to be here   today and to shine a national spotlight   on a group of victims who have been   forced and I mean truly forced into the   shadows your stories are not featured in   the news you have no demonstrators   taking to the streets on your behalf you   have no special interest taking up your   cause and the politicians ignore your   cries for help but I never will I will   never   [Music]   [Applause]   and I've known many of you for a long   time now it seems like a long time but   I'm still here and you're still here   right still fighting I've met many   incredible people during the course of   this campaign but nothing has moved me   more deeply than the time I've spent   with the families of the remembrance   project folks in remembrance by the way   are doing such an incredible job   [Applause]   and the strength and the courage that   you've shown in your very often lonely   fight for justice will get there you are   the heroes you are and your actions will   help us to save the next thousand   American citizens from losing their   brothers and sisters and sons and   daughters and parents the most   fundamental duty of government is to   protect American lives   [Applause]   anyone who fails to understand this is   not fit to hold public office   [Applause]   every day our border remains open   innocent Americans are needlessly   victimized and killed every day   sanctuary cities are left in place   innocent Americans are put in harm's way   every day we fail to enforce our laws in   a day and this is absolutely happening   all the time is a day when a loving   parent is at risk of losing their child   and it's happening every single day all   across this country dining room tables   have an empty seat at the family table   because our government abandoned its   duty and failed to enforce its basic   laws there are a lot of numbers the   immigration debate I've been talking   about it for a long time and obviously   people agree with me because you see   what's happening you see the numbers you   see the polls you see what's going on at   the rallies a lot of people agree with   me almost it seems everybody agrees you   almost say what's not to agree with but   let me give you what's not really   but let me give you the most important   number of all that most important number   of all is the number of American lives   that is acceptable to lose in the name   of illegal immigration let me tell you   what that number is zero   [Applause]   our nation should not accept one lost   American life because our country failed   to enforce its laws what do you tell the   mother who just buried her daughter   because someone was released at the   border who should have been sent home or   should have been imprisoned in another   country what do you tell the young boy   who will grow up without a dad because   the criminal was deported 5 times but   was allowed to keep coming back and   coming back and coming back into our   country doing tremendous harm what do   you tell the wife who's lost her husband   because a sanctuary city released an   illegal immigrant from behind bars this   has to end it will end if I become   president I promise you   [Music]   [Applause]   Thank   [Applause]   thank you everybody thank you i love you   love everybody in this room special   special people not one more american   life should be given up in the name of   open borders just look at what happened   in the last few days last week it was   reported that authorities detained an   illegal immigrant in the austin area who   is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual   assaults and had been previously   deported five times within a three year   period earlier this week in Kansas a   Sheriff's Department master deputy was   killed apparently by an illegal   immigrant the driver was previously   arrested for DUI in California in 2001   and for traffic violations in Kansas   deputy Collins was killed only hours   after his daughter's fourth birthday a   few days ago to correctional officers in   California were critically wounded after   being shot by an illegal immigrant who   overstayed his visa this individual had   been convicted of child rape and was   slated to be deported but his home   country refused to take him back he was   simply too bad too tough to evil they   said we refuse to take him back one of   the victims has six children is an Air   Force veteran in a high school football   coach the other victim is a mother and a   grandmother when Hillary Clinton was   Secretary of State the matter of this   country and think of us think of this   matter of this country refusing to take   back their deported sis and came before   Hillary Clinton's desk oftentimes many   times but she failed to take forceful   action and ignored the federal law   requiring her to suspend reasons to   countries that don't take back their   citizens she didn't want to get involved   politician politicians according to a   report from the Boston Globe from the   year two thousand eight through 2014   nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were   released back into u.s. communities   because their home countries would not   take them back they were too tough that   were too angry they were too evil they   don't want them back and we don't force   them back we want to be nice people that   we want to be nice and politically   correct and they're all roaming the   streets most of these 13,000 releases   occurred when Hillary Clinton's watch   she had the power of the duty to stop it   cold and she didn't now my opponent will   never meet with you never meet with you   no interest you know that because you've   been trying for a long time years   they've been trying for years she will   never hear your stories she will never   share your pain she will only meet with   the donors and the special interests and   the oprah and you know the open border   advocates her plan calls for total   amnesty in the first 100 days which   means obamacare Social Security and   Medicare for illegal immigrants her plan   calls   her plan calls for catch and release on   the border sanctuary cities ignoring   visa overstays closing detention centers   and a virtual end to immigration   enforcement in the United States of   America Hillary Clinton has even   announced that she plans to go around   Congress and implement amnesty by   executive order violating our   Constitution and putting the entire   nation in grave peril Hillary Clinton is   the person and I mean the first person   to ever run for the presidency of a   country effectively proposing to abolish   the borders around the country that   she's supposed to be representing but   the media doesn't want you to know that   so they'll never ask her any questions   about her plan won't be talked about at   the debate which is going to be a very   interesting period of time   by casual afford to give lifetime   welfare and entitlements to illegal   immigrants or how many people will be   victimized because of the illegal   immigrants that will be released from   federal custody right at the border or   inside of the border she's not asked to   explain what shall say to the American   workers who lose their jobs when she   prints out millions of work permits for   those here totally against the law many   of whom have very very substantial   problems your cause and your stories are   ignored by our political establishment   because they are determined to keep our   border open at any cost to them your   presence is just too inconvenient until   it is it's an inconvenience but help is   coming tell you that   [Applause]   on november eighth we're going to win   the White House   [Applause]   and we are going to deliver justice for   every American family and every single   American victim you know what that means   you know what that means together we   will save American lives and prevent the   next thousand American parents from   suffering the same fate as the people in   this room today their loved ones will   not have died in vain believe me since   2013 11 think of this since 2013 the   Obama administration has allowed three   hundred thousand criminal aliens to   return back into the United States and   its communities these are individuals   encountered or identified by ice but who   were not detained or processed for   deportation according to the federal   government's own data there are more   than two million convicted criminal   illegal immigrants inside of the United   States right now two million then we   wonder why do we have such crime why do   we have such violence and this is true   violence this is violence like most   people have never even heard of before   however this figure does not include the   many individuals who have committed   crimes but escaped justice fled the   jurisdiction or otherwise never caught   and many of the folks are in that   position where you even sometimes know   who they are and yet they're never   caught we're going to catch him   [Music]   many crimes committed by people here   illegally remain open cases and yet our   government knows a lot about the people   that did it but they don't go after   they've killed people they don't go   after him at the same time hundreds of   individuals who have been given visas   and refuge and think of us they've been   given visas their refugee admissions   into the country subsequently were   charged with terrorism and nobody does   anything about it nobody does anything   about it it's the most unbelievable   thing that I've seen that's why I become   it's like become a personal passion for   me when I see these people and there's   so many people remembrance project there   are so many people this is a small group   a lot of people it's a small group   compared to what we're talking about the   devastation is unbelievable so we're   admitting people here with no idea of   who they are and we don't know very much   about them we don't know what they   believe we don't know if they have loved   in their heart for our country or if   they have hatred in their heart for our   country whether it's drugs terrorism or   violent crime our government is utterly   failing in its core mission to defend   and protect the people of this country   the Border Patrol agents these are   incredible people they endorsed me first   then they've ever endorsed a   presidential   [Applause]   they've worn that Hillary Clinton's plan   would put the entire country in grave   danger I fully understand they called it   radical deeply dangers and warned that   would trigger an unprecedented national   crisis they know they know better than   any consultant they know better than   anybody the Border Patrol agents let's   just remember our goal to prevent the   next family from suffering the same   terrible fate   [Applause]   that is what is at stake in this   election so I am now going to invite   some of the bravest people I know and I   mean that one hundred percent to come up   here and speak let's start maybe from   this side we've picked five families and   if you could say a few words so how   about we start over here come on perfect   thank you thank you ever thank you so   much for being here my name is Laura   what

[Music]   [Applause]   Chief Justice Roberts President Carter   President Clinton President Bush   President Obama fellow Americans and   people of the world thank you we either   citizens of America are now joined a   great national effort to rebuild our   country and restore its promise for all   of our people together we will determine   the course of America and the world for   many many years to come we will face   challenges we will confront hardships   but we will get the job done   every four years we gather on these   steps to carry out the orderly and   peaceful transfer of power and we are   grateful to President Obama and first   lady Michelle Obama for their gracious   aid throughout this transition they have   been magnificent thank you   today's ceremony however has very   special meaning because today we are not   merely transferring power from one   administration to another or from one   party to another but we are transferring   power from Washington DC and giving it   back to you the people   for too long a small group in our   nation's capital has reaped the rewards   of government while the people have   borne the cost Washington flourished but   the people did not share in its wealth   politicians prospered but the jobs left   and the factories closed the   establishment protected itself but not   the citizens of our country their   victories have not been your victories   their triumphs have not been your   triumphs and while they celebrated in   our nation's capital there was little to   celebrate for struggling families all   across our land   that all changes starting right here and   right now because this moment is your   moment it belongs to you   it belongs to everyone gathered here   today and everyone watching all across   America this is your day this is your   celebration and this the United States   of America is your country what really   matters is not which party controls our   government but whether our government is   controlled by the people January 20th   2017 will be remembered as the day the   people became the rulers of this nation   again   The Forgotten men and women of our   country will be forgotten no longer   everyone is listening to you now you   came by the tens of millions to become   part of a historic movement the likes of   which the world has never seen before at   the center of this movement is a crucial   conviction that a nation exists to serve   its citizens Americans want great   schools for their children safe   neighborhoods for their families and   good jobs for themselves these are just   and reasonable demands of righteous   people and a righteous public but for   too many of our citizens a different   reality exists mothers and children   trapped in poverty in our inner cities   rusted out factories scattered like   tombstones across the landscape of our   nation an education system flush with   cash but which leaves our young and   beautiful students deprived of all   knowledge and the crime and the gangs   and the drugs that have stolen too many   lives and robbed our country of so much   unrealized potential this American   carnage stops right here and stops right   now   we are one nation and their pain is our   pain their dreams are our dreams and   their success will be our success we   share one heart one home and one   glorious destiny the oath of office I   take today is an oath of allegiance to   all Americans for many decades we've   enriched foreign industry at the expense   of American industry subsidize the   armies of other countries while allowing   for the very sad depletion of our   military we've defended other nation's   borders while refusing to defend our own   and spent trillions and trillions of   dollars overseas while America's   infrastructure has fallen into disrepair   and decay we've made other countries   rich while the wealth strength and   confidence of our country has dissipated   over the horizon one by one the factory   shuttered and left our shores with not   even a thought about the millions and   millions of American workers that were   left behind the wealth of our middle   class has been ripped from their homes   and then redistributed all across the   world but that is the past and now we   are looking only to the future   we assembled here today are issuing a   new decree to be heard in every city in   every foreign capital and in every Hall   of power from this day forward a new   vision will govern our land from this   day forward it's going to be only   America first America first   every decision on trade on taxes on   immigration on Foreign Affairs will be   made to benefit American workers and   American families we must protect our   borders from the ravages of other   countries making our products stealing   our companies and destroying our jobs   [Applause]   protection will lead to great prosperity   and strength I will fight for you   with every breath in my body and I will   never ever let you down   America will start winning again winning   like never before we will bring back our   jobs we will bring back our borders we   will bring back our wealth and we will   bring back our dreams   we will build new roads and highways and   bridges and airports and tunnels and   railways all across our wonderful nation   we will get our people off of welfare   and back to work rebuilding our country   with American hands and American labor   we will follow two simple rules by   American and hire American we will seek   friendship and goodwill with the nations   of the world but we do so with the   understanding that it is the right of   all nations to put their own interests   first we do not seek to impose our way   of life on anyone but rather to let it   shine as an example we will shine for   everyone to follow we will reinforce old   alliances and form new ones and unite   the civilized world against radical   Islamic terrorism which we will   eradicate completely from the face of   the earth   at the bedrock of our politics will be a   total allegiance to the United States of   America and through our loyalty to our   country we will rediscover our loyalty   to each other when you open your heart   to patriotism there is no room for   prejudice the Bible tells us how good   and pleasant it is when God's people   live together in unity we must speak our   minds openly debate our disagreements   honestly but always pursue solidarity   when America is united America is   totally unstoppable   there should be no fear we are protected   and we will always be protected we will   be protected by the great men and women   of our military and law enforcement and   most importantly we will be protected by   God   finally we must think big and dream even   bigger in America we understand that a   nation is only living as long as it is   striving we will no longer accept   politicians who are all talk and no   action   constantly complaining but never doing   anything about it   the time for empty talk is over now   arrives the hour of action do not allow   anyone to tell you that it cannot be   done no challenge can match the heart   and fight and spirit of America we will   not fail our country will thrive and   prosper again we stand at the birth of a   new millenium ready to unlock the   mysteries of space to free the earth   from the miseries of disease and to   harness the energies industries and   technologies of tomorrow a new national   pride will stir ourselves lift our   sights and heal our divisions it's time   to remember that old wisdom our soldiers   will never forget that whether we are   black or brown or white we all bleed the   same red blood of patriots   we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms   and we all salute the same great   American flag and whether a child is   born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or   the windswept plains of Nebraska they   look up at the same night sky they fill   their heart with the same dreams and   they are infused with the breath of life   by the same Almighty Creator so to all   Americans in every city near and far   small and large from Mountain to   mountain from ocean to ocean hear these   words you will never be ignored again   [Applause]   your voice your hopes and your dreams   will define our American destiny and   your courage and goodness and love will   forever guide us along the way together   we will make America strong again we   will make America wealthy again we will   make America proud again we will make   America safe again and yes together we   will make America great again thank you   god bless you and God bless america   thank you god bless america   [Applause]   you

Donald J Trump   thank you everybody thank you thank you   thank you so I thought we'd start a   little bit early go home and watch   football and your team now all of your   fans are pouring in there outside   virginia tech won the game 54 to 17   amazing Lane Stadium and they're all   outside trying to come in so let's not   wait right it's great to be in Virginia   a state where I have so many great   friends and wonderful employees I have   some great properties here with great   great employees it's tremendous and we   have wonderful poles they just keep   coming in a brand-new rasmussen poll   just out has us leading by five points   nationwide   and on November a we are going to win   this state and we are going to win the   White House we're going to take it back   we're going to take on the big donors   and big business and big media we're   going to take on the rig system that has   shipped America's wealth to other   countries and they keep doing so we're   going to replace our failed and corrupt   establishment with a government that   serves you your family and your country   my economic agenda can be summed up in   some very very powerful words jobs jobs   jobs   we will cut taxes for all working in   middle-class households in America we   will reduce regulations which will put   more money into the hands of our poorest   workers and bring thousands of new   companies to our shores we will unleash   American energy creating millions of new   jobs and lowering energy costs for   everyone we will repeal and replace   Obamacare   President Obama promises plan would   reduce premiums by two thousand five   hundred dollars a year instead they have   surged to five thousand dollars a year   more our replacement plan that's true   includes expanded access to health care   savings accounts with support for those   who need it it includes allowing   Americans to buy health insurance across   state lines in all 50 states a diamond   right a dynamic and competitive new   market they will be competing for your   business you will be making your own   deals and they'll be greater than you   ever thought possible believe me a lot   of those deals today you don't even know   what they're going to be because they're   going to get better and better all the   time with competition we're also going   to block grant Medicaid the states so   they can develop innovative solutions to   make sure no citizen in poverty ever   falls through the cracks never high-risk   pools will also help to ensure that   those with pre-existing conditions will   always get the quality coverage they   need entree we are going to end the   international abuse the foreign cheating   and the one-sided rules that govern   NAFTA   [Applause]   what a deal that is and the World Trade   Organization right now America   eliminates its tariffs but then other   countries tax our goods with backdoor   tariffs and close their markets in other   words they tax us but we don't tax them   not too good and you know how that's   been working out folks it's a one-way   highway out of this country for our jobs   and our money our massive chronic trade   deficits are destroying the middle class   and shifting money away from workers to   large corporations who have no borders   there's a reason The Wall Street donors   are giving tens of millions of dollars   to my opponent Hillary Clinton is the   voice for global special interests I'm   running to be the voice of the Forgotten   men and women of this country believe me   they are   my opponent likes to say that for   decades she's been fighting for women   that she's been fighting for children   why then are 70 million American women   and children living in poverty or in the   brink of poverty in our country why has   she provided no relief for the millions   of Americans in search of affordable   reliable quality childcare for years   he's been doing this and she's done   nothing you know the old saying watch   what I do not what I say at the Trump   Organization and in my campaign for   president women occupy some of the   highest positions I have employed   thousands of women in my company women   of different backgrounds women of many   talents and just last week joined by my   daughter Ivanka no Ivanka   I laid out my plan for child care and   elder care that plan has many great   features including tax free child care   savings account low-income parents are   given tax credits they can put straight   into those accounts and then get a five   hundred dollar per child match for those   savings accounts deposits families can   also deduct the cost of child care from   their taxes a huge tax cut for the   middle class we also have and as we've   been doing we've been talking a lot   about improving education my plan   includes school choice for every single   disadvantaged child in America and we're   going to get rid of and totally end   common core   we're also going to bring down the cost   of college universities get massive   federal funds and huge tax breaks for   their endowments but then they don't   spend those funds or those endowments on   their students I will work with Congress   to make sure these special federal   benefits are not available unless   universities begin to reduce tuition and   student debt it's too expensive this   will get to them and this will get it   this will really do it the problem this   is the problem and it's right smack in   the middle of the source and reduce both   the costs for students and the course   for taxpayers our students are drowning   in debt and we're going to fix it   women also by the way value security   they want a commander-in-chief that will   defeat radical Islamic terrorism stop   it's time going on too long it's now in   30 countries started off in a little   area they left a big vacuum Hillary   Clinton and Barack Obama and now it's in   30 countries may be more than that we   want to stop the massive inflow of   refugees protect our borders   and we want to reduce the rising crime   and violence in our cities   [Applause]   we will build a wall I promise we will   build the wall   and Mexico will pay for the wall they   will   as I campaign across this country I hear   so many stories and pleas from women   especially about drug addiction and   opioid use they are doing their best in   their communities and for their families   to provide a safe and nurturing   environment but even the best-laid plans   cannot always protect our youth and   increasingly many adults from the   scourge of drugs this is a scourge we   lose thousands of our fellow Americans   every year to drugs and opioid use I   will stop the drug inflow from our   borders believe me   these terrible drugs come over the   border and make their way into our urban   and rural communities and into our   suburbs this must stop this must change   and the people that are there now your   so-called leadership group will never   ever change it and that includes Hilary   believe me every change starts with a   conversation together we will have this   conversation and we will make this   change one hundred percent the change   will start immediately here in Virginia   we are going to end the war on American   energy and on our miners   Hillary Clinton say she wants to put the   miners out of work   Clinton and Kane also want to shut down   shale and shut down natural gas what   they've done is incredible the Clinton   regulatory agenda will drive up   electricity prices for Virginia families   you know that you're already seeing it   and will cost the US economy over five   trillion dollars by the way Tim Kaine   less than a week after taking office in   Virginia proposed a four billion dollar   tax ID on your steak a four billion   dollar hike including on people earning   as little as seventeen thousand dollars   a year one week in office and he   proposed a four billion dollar tax hike   and you know he's not very popular he   won his election by a very very close   margin when I heard she picked I said   you know maybe that's bad for me we're   just about tied in Virginia and we   haven't started advertising and then   spending a fortune she made the wrong   pic we are going to open up all sources   of American energy and bring jobs well   and cheaper electricity to Virginia and   all over the country   another major part of our agenda is   safety I believe every family in America   is entitled to live in safety and in   peace today the nation just opened the   Smithsonian National Museum of American   History african-american art it's really   a beautiful place I saw it the other day   and going around Washington and it   looked beautiful and we're all very   proud of it i can tell you that we   congratulate and honor those involved   with the project and recognize today the   incredible contributions of the   african-american community to this   nation african-americans have given so   much to our nation and sacrifice so much   for this nation many African Americans   are succeeding so greatly in our country   and I will make sure their success is   protected and supported at the same time   too many African Americans have been   left behind and trapped in poverty I   will fight to make sure every single   african-american child in this country   is fully included in the American dream   [Music]   that includes the new civil rights issue   of our time school choice Democrats have   run the inner cities for half a century   or more and produce only more   joblessness and more poverty the jobs   are leaving the schools are failing and   crime is rising like never before in the   inner cities so to those African   American and Hispanic voters I say vote   for Donald Trump what do you   have to lose I will fix it I will fight   harder for you than anyone has before   the policies of Hillary Clinton have   brought only suffering in our inner   cities just like her bad judgment   overseas unleashed suffering everywhere   she went she's got bad judgment of   course she got rich through it all the   Clintons made another 60 million dollars   in gross income while she was Secretary   of State think of that worst of all she   put her public office up for sale and   then bleached sir emails and destroyed   her iphones with a hammer to try and   cover up her tracks following a   congressional subpoena figure that one   out   [Applause]   there's a reason the hedge fund managers   are donating to Hillary Clinton's   campaign and not mine everybody getting   rich off the rig system and who wants   really nothing but keeping it the same   they want to keep it just the same and   they're throwing their money at Hillary   Clinton I wonder why my campaign is   powered by my own money and buy small   dollar donations for everybody and all   of our patriotic citizens ninety percent   of our donors are small dollar donations   and we're setting records for republican   party records every dollar helps us   deliver your county your country your   area virginia and i'll tell you what it   all essentially goes back to you because   we're just going to make it a better   place where we keep our jobs and we   bring new jobs in   our campaign is about breaking up the   special interest monopoly in Washington   DC we're trying to disrupt the collusion   between the wealthy donors the large   corporations and the media executives   [Applause]   they're all part of the same political   establishment they go to the same   restaurants they attend the same   conferences they have the same friends   and connections they all support the   same ideology of globalism that makes   them rich while shipping your jobs your   factories and your wealth to other   countries all over the place in   particular lately to Mexico I'm not   running to be President of the world I'm   running to be President of the United   States and turn things around   I am for America and for America first   always America first   together we will rebuild this country by   ond and I mean beyond any of our dreams   we have such unbelievable potential in   our country such unbelievable I mean the   potential we have in this country I've   gone all over the country or the crowds   everything it's so incredible the people   are so incredible our leaders are   leading us down a deadly path whether   it's our military that's so depleted the   greatest people on earth they have   depleted equipment everything's wrong   our vets are being so badly treated our   veterans how many veterans do we have   today   you have illegal immigrants being   treated better than our veterans in many   cases that's not going to happen that's   not going to happen anymore government   will start working again fixing things   is what I do just look at my projects in   New York City where I turn rundown   spaces into new centers of business   activity and opportunity where others   saw only problems i saw mendes potential   we turned empty lots into homes offices   and living memories for thousands of   workers and their families that's what I   do and that's what I will continue to do   for our country but on a very very big   scale believe me I want to go in I want   to go into our neglected neighborhoods   the failing schools the Forgotten   stretches of this nation and unlock   their potential for all of our people   I've made a living for years looking at   unused spaces and imagining what they   could be it's been a great living   politicians look at blighted   neighborhoods and offer only excuses and   by the way all they want is the vote in   the inner city in particular give us   your vote and then we'll see you in four   years that's what it is they do nothing   I look at those same neighborhoods and   offer solutions everything broken today   can be fixed all we have to do is to now   the doubters the cynics and the   naysayers and there are plenty of them   we are a nation of strivers dreamers and   believers and that's the spirit that   will carry us to victory in November and   two great victories as a nation we will   be respected again as a nation   it's that same spirit of resilience I've   seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in   Louisiana or meeting with the incredible   but hard hit people in cities and towns   like flint michigan what a shame what a   shame what they've done in flint spend   hundreds of millions of dollars to   destroy the water system if they would   have left it alone it would have been   okay hundreds of millions of dollars and   now they're going to need hundreds of   millions of dollars more and it used to   be where the cars were made in Flint and   you couldn't drink the water in Mexico   today the cars are made in Mexico and   you can't drink the water in Flint   Michigan no good folks no good we're   going to turn it around but that means   you need to show up and vote on November   rain you have to show up   you have to knock on doors you have to   pick up that phone you have to campaign   on the streets spread the love that we   have this is a movement like nobody's   ever seen before in this country spread   the love that we have in this room to   beat the system you have to lift your   voice pound the pavement and get out and   vote and get all your friends out to   vote   we have 44 days until the big vote you   have 44 days to make possible every   dream you ever dreamed for yourselves   and your country you have one   magnificent chance to deliver justice   for every forgotten man woman and child   in this nation the arrogance of   Washington DC will soon come face to   face with the righteous verdict of the   American worker and voter believe me   it's enough this November we are going   to show the whole world that America is   back bigger and better and stronger than   ever before   [Applause]   here is your some of what will happen   starting in January of 2017 I'm going to   lower your taxes Hillary is going to   raise your taxes substantially   I'm going to eliminate every unnecessary   regulation of which there are many   Hilary is going to keep it going worse   than ever before we're going to leash   and I mean unleash American energy and   we're going to be so good to our miners   we got to help our miners folks we are   going to get those miners back we're   going to end illegal immigration and yes   we will build a wall we will build a   wall we're going to rebuild your very   depleted military and again take care of   our veterans   and we are going to support and cherish   our police officers and firefighters   we're going to save our Second Amendment   which is under siege and we are going to   appoint justices to the Supreme Court of   the United States who will uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   States we will rebuild our roads bridges   tunnels highways airports schools   hospitals and everything else we will   rebuild the infrastructure of our   country which is crumbling like never   before it will be rebuilt American cars   will travel the roads American planes   will soar the skies and American ships   will patrol the Seas American steel will   send new skyscrapers into the

Ocx7mkhtkOM~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160907~FULL: Donald Trump Speech at the New York Conservative Party (9/7/2016)~18822.0~4.76086950302~519.0~33.0~   thank you Jim thank you very much you   know I have been noticing lately the   different effects that lying can have on   different people you know for some we   know that their noses grow like   Pinocchio others sweat profusely and   others just start coughing   uncontrollably but uh I don't hear any   coughing here in this room and you know   what that means two things one nobody   here is a liar and number two nobody   here is allergic to Donald Trump that's   really good seriously as a Reagan   conservative since my college days and a   staunch believer in the principles and   the policies of the New York   conservative party   I supported Donald J Trump from the very   beginning from before the beginning and   you know some some of my fellow   conservatives couldn't understand I lost   friends over it I lost staff over it but   it was he who actually inspired me to   jump into this US Senate race against   Chuck Schumer and you know great leaders   do that they inspire others like Donald   Trump I saw what was happening to our   great country and I felt like I had no   choice our nominee speaks to the   American people in their capacity as   citizens they can be any race or   religion but they must in accepting the   freedom and the protection that our   nation provides take on the obligations   and the duties of citizenship the whole   ocean sounds vaguely outdated too many   ears particularly those in the media and   the political elites we hear a lot these   days about what everyone is entitled to   especially what political correctness   dictates we must say or do but our   nominee speaks to us as individuals   as citizens of the greatest country the   world has ever known and he wants to   conserve the freedom and greatness of   that country and that I submit to you   ladies and gentlemen is the most   conservative and the best work that can   be done by anyone in this day in this   country   thank you and now ladies and gentlemen   would you please welcome the chairman of   the Conservative Party in the state of   New York the Honorable Mike law   [Applause]   good evening everybody let me first   thank each and every one of you for   being here   you know since 2012 I've been   consistently saying that 2016 is going   to be one of the most important   elections this nation is ever going to   face I haven't changed my mind about   that folks this year while every   election is important there's no doubt   about it this is the most important   election about the future of our nation   that we've witnessed in decades   we cannot afford we cannot afford four   more years or eight more years of Obama   or the corruption of the Hilary machine   we cannot afford that America American   needs a fresh start and this afternoon   the leaders of the Conservative Party in   this hotel had our statewide convention   for one purpose to nominate the next   president and vice president of the   United States we nominated and supported   the Trump pence ticket   we did that we did that to get America   on the right track and moving in the   right direction and I'm pleased to   introduce to you the guy that's going to   get America moving again create jobs   bring back the respect the   respectability of this nation in the   free world and yes in fact control our   borders ladies and gentlemen the next   president of the United States Donald   Trump   Wow thank you thank you everybody I know   so many people in this room this is a   room I really know the people there's no   question about it Mike I just want to   thank you I've known Mike so long and   it's I knew he when he was a young   handsome beautiful guy now he's a little   older but still handsome right   but thank you Mike that's a great honor   having the Conservative Party and just   so you understand we are going to play   New York you know we're not just doing   this for fun we're gonna play like that   and I want to wish the best to Wendy and   I've watched Wendy over the years and   know Wendy and she's a terrific woman   and she's gonna be fighting hard and I   think she's gonna surprise a lot of   people so Wendy wherever you may be back   there right there   great great luck and you're gonna do   very well I want to just thank a few   people that are here I assume that we   have Carl Paladino somewhere who is Karl   Karl John J we have and Joe from Nassau   we have and we have I think Edie I don't   know is Eddie here at cooks where's that   where's ed where the heck is that ah   hello ed we're gonna play it ed okay   we're gonna play we're also gonna do   those others that you told me about but   we're gonna I think we're gonna do very   well I think we're gonna do very well we   have been and I have been in love with a   state for a long time and this is I   guess the first time in a long time that   you really have a competitive person   running for president that comes from   New York and I think we're gonna do very   well the the polls are looking great   we're playing a lot of states that a lot   of people never thought of in terms of a   Republican I don't know maybe they're   just not thinking I'm as much of a   Republican as I think I am but states   are in play that are never in play for   Republicans and you probably saw the   polls coming out and the recent CNN poll   that came out I guess this morning has   us to up on Hillary   so so I'm a longtime New Yorker   I've spent billions and billions of   dollars in this state and city I've   produced tremendous numbers of jobs it's   been very good to me also and we want to   win it we want to win it and we're gonna   help New York we have to help New York   because it's got very difficult problems   taxes are too high by far you had a lot   of great opportunities to reduce taxes   you had a lot of great opportunities   upstate that weren't taken advantage of   you know what I mean   when I went around and won New York so   big in the primary this was the one it   was just boom we won New York it was a   it was massive just about everything we   won just about every location every   place you could be and it was an honor   and I always tell people you know   winning New York by such a landslide   against very capable people in the   primaries that was an honor for me   because nobody knows me better than New   Yorkers I say it's always bad so he's   bad never good when you lose your state   and you lose it badly so we wanted in a   landslide and just won every area of it   and with the help of all of the folks I   just mentioned in Carl and I were just   talking we're gonna make a very very   heavy play upstate we're gonna do   unbelievably well I see the ads I don't   know how much money they spent on that   ad but I guarantee you the money would   have been better spent doing something   else because I don't think a lot of   people have signed up but I'm hearing   numbers like hundreds of millions of   dollars I've never seen an ad that's   been on so much and so long but it's   it's an ad nevertheless about bringing   your business to New York right and   you've all seen it and I just wonder how   much business has been gotten from that   ad Mike how much business has been   gotten from that ad would you rather   have the ad money or the business that's   been gotten he take the money hey come   here get over here   [Applause]   this is like Old Home Week it's nice to   have the President of the United States   from New York but also a Westchester   resident nice to see you ruff good man   he's gonna do very well gonna do very   very well so over the years I've watched   a lot of bad things happen a lot of good   things happen but I've watched upstate   I've watched out on the island I've   watched businesses leave and I think one   of the reasons I'm standing here instead   of somebody else is that frankly we have   really hit a chord with jobs and we've   also had it with illegal immigration   lots of different things the military in   fact I'm going from here I'm going over   to NBC we're doing an interview with   Matt Lauer sure that'll be a lot of fun   a lot of fun sure it'll be very fair   and maybe it will be hey he's a good guy   maybe it will be let's see well let you   know right but III just you know I it's   so sad when I toured the state during   the primaries and I got to see every   part of the state I was in Syracuse and   I was in Albany and I was everywhere and   I saw those great beautiful buildings   that were empty and rotting and falling   down from the wind and the rain and the   snow and they're all over the state and   there's no hope there's no hope other   than if I become president because they   will be great there will be great   because we're gonna bring our jobs back   to New York   we're gonna bring our jobs back to our   country but we're gonna bring our jobs   back to New York what happened is so   said those companies have moved to   Mexico and other places but a lot of   them moving to Mexico I tell this to I   have a friend who builds plants that's   what he does he builds plants Rob if he   had a building apartment house maybe he   wouldn't know where but I'll tell you   this is a great guy I think he's just   about the biggest in the world of doing   this and I say to him how are you doing   how's business he said unbelievable oh   good   where are you building mostly Mexico oh   that's not so good that's not so good   well why he said Donald what we're doing   in Mexico is the eighth wonder of the   world the eighth wonder of the world   think of that this is a man who builds   these massive factories and car plants   etc he said it's unbelievable when you   see what's happening I said how you   doing in the United States where he's   from and where he really would like to   be doing the building he goes man not so   good and he said but you have to come to   Mexico I just left Mexico by the way   that worked out very well   and I don't blame Mexico for doing what   they're doing I mean I respect Mexico I   have great respect for the leaders and   the president was very very nice   but you know our businesses were   building our businesses just pouring   it's just pouring into Mexico and other   places and then China in a different way   they're making our product and they're   dumping it all over and you look at   what's happening with our steel workers   you look at what's happened with our   miners and all of the it's just   incredible what's happening to our   country and we've got to stop it and we   will stop it by the way 100% we will   stop it we're not gonna let this   continue to happen so so I I just have   to say it's been such an honor to be   involved for so long with the   Conservative Party with the Republican   Party to heed I couldn't forget you I   would be in trouble if I forgot it but   for tonight the Conservative Party I've   been a supporter I've been a supporter   of Mike's for a long time and we're   gonna do a great job you know it's a   little bit like fixing the country   fixing the state we have to fix it when   I last time when I was with the   Republicans at the Grand Hyatt which I   built I told the story of the Wollman   Rink how it was closed for eight years a   total disaster the city couldn't get it   built they had no clue they had   engineers that came from Miami   you don't want an engineer for a   ice-skating rink that comes from Miami   and they couldn't make ice and they try   and they had copper tubing and it was   going miles and miles and miles and did   lay it and the next day it would be   stolen and then they'd lay it and it'll   be stalled   this one one four years right they'd lay   it down copper was was in his very   expensive and what happened is I went to   Koch Ed Koch the mayor of New York I   said mr. mayor my kids are growing up I   want them to be able to ice skate at   least once before they're at a point   where they don't want to ice skate   anymore and I see people sitting in the   rink all day long they had to lunch   breaks one in the morning one in the   afternoon and there was no work and   hundreds of people would be sitting in   this massive slab and when they poured   the slab they poured in little chunks   okay a lot of construction people   because I have a lot of friends here but   that poured in little chunks and then   they come in the next day and by the   time it was all finished they had chunks   all over the place and it wasn't even   and it was like this it was at a big   level so when they put the water on and   one side they had like a foot and a half   of water and the other one they had like   an inch and they didn't know what they   were doing and I said to Ed Koch and I   went to the newspapers I said you know   because they didn't want to let me do it   they didn't want to be stood up or they   didn't want to be shown up and they went   I went to the newspapers the editorial   boards who actually even though I'm much   more successful now they don't treat me   nearly as well I'm trying to figure this   out but they actually did treat me very   well and they said let Trump do it and   it was a lot of pressure put on and they   let me do it and I did it in four months   they had spent I think probably twenty   twenty-one million dollars I hear   eighteen I hear seventeen honestly they   had no idea what they spent whatever it   was they spent a fortune and I took it   over and the first thing I did is I had   to get an engineer so I fired the guy   from Miami because he obviously didn't   know what he was doing and he he   recommended actually he said why don't   you try somebody mr. Trump from Montreal   I said that's good and then I remember I   have a friend who was involved with the   Montreal Canadiens the ice hockey team   as I called him I said Edgar would you   do me a favor   do you have an engine do you have   anybody that knows how to make ice she   said oh I have the greatest guy and he   gave me the name the guy came to New   York really nice person and   he said all mr. Trump this is terrible   they're using gases they're using freon   and in that pipe if you have one little   pinhole one little tiny pinhole in miles   and miles of pipe it'll escape and you   can't make the ice that's a horrible   thing that stuff is meant for   refrigerators not for ice skating rinks   I said that makes sense you know in the   back of the refrigerator right and that   quite you know 20 miles of stuff so he   said what you want is brined I said   what's bribed he said well this   basically water with salt in it so it   doesn't freeze and you put it in rubber   hoses and you make it very cold doesn't   freeze and all of a sudden you have I   said boy that sounds good so I thanked   him he drew it up I went out I hired   some really good contractors I got rid   of all the copper that was really none   left it was mostly stolen I put down the   rubber hose nobody was stealing the   rubber hose nobody stole the rubber hose   it's amazing rubber hose doesn't have   quite the same allure but it was rubber   hose clamps at each end miles and miles   of rubber hose and we put it down   quickly and beautifully we got the right   machine that froze the water and the   water went through the rubber hose and   we checked it for leaks because even if   it leaked it wouldn't matter that much   unlike the other but I said I don't want   the leak anyway so before the concrete   went down we checked then I got a   concrete guy who was great and we had   trucks lined up to Harlem all the way   back to Harlem one contiguous pour   because that's the only way to do it one   contiguous pour we laid the rebar and we   had these trucks they poured for 24   hours stretch a big surface massive   surface actually and it was like perfect   we laser finished it and then we let it   heal and we poured water over it 2   inches   they said 2 inches is perfect and we   turned on the Machine and lo and behold   shortly thereafter there was ice   and amazing amazing   and it's been a story that's been   documented in the Wharton School and the   Harvard Business School and all over   because it's really it's private   enterprise free enterprise private   versus government and there are others   you know I just did the very point job   but was under construction for like 25   years or something nobody even knows you   know yes come how long and they don't   really even know they don't have no idea   how much they spend and we got that one   open it's a tremendously big success in   the Bronx but somehow the Wollman Rink   you it's just it's just a case study   then we fixed up the building which was   real easy and I have it to this day it's   there's no ice rink in the world that   does more business than our ice rink and   it's been tremendously successful and we   really you know have a good time and you   know in a very very large scale version   we have to do the same for New York   State that's what we have to do we have   to bring back our businesses we can't   let our remaining businesses go if they   go and they make a product and they want   to move to Mexico and they want to fire   all of the employees like they've in all   fairness been doing we're very late to   the picture this speech should have been   made 15 years ago but I was doing other   things I was one of those companies that   was doing well in New York but if they   want to leave and if they want to make   product in a different country and they   want to send it over to our borders and   yet fire all our people and not pay   taxes and they think they're going to   send that over the border there's not   going to be consequences not gonna   happen and once you say look we hope you   enjoy your stay in Mexico or wherever   it's a beautiful location and you're   building a lovely-looking plant but   every time you make your product and you   think you're going to send it over what   will be very soon a very strong border   you will pay a 35% tax every single time   you send your product over   and I'll tell you it's very late in the   game unfortunately but this should have   been done years ago and you would had   nobody leave because two things are   gonna happen number one they're not   gonna leave that's about 95 percent and   then if they do that's okay too cuz   we're gonna make a fortune okay but then   I can leave and nobody wants to do this   because these people and these   politicians are all controlled by the   special interests I don't the companies   that want to move to other countries and   make lots of money and that's the way it   is so we're gonna bring our businesses   back we are going to make sure that   they're going to come back into New York   and New York State   I'm tired when I looked out in Suffolk   in different places on Long Island when   I made that to her I couldn't believe   what I saw I couldn't believe it   actually I've been here all my life I   couldn't believe it the devastation that   has happened in this state I couldn't   believe it so we're going to turn things   around we're gonna bring back our jobs   we're going to bring back companies and   we're going to start a lot of new   companies but not with an ad we're gonna   start it by having low taxes and being   smart and I just want to tell you folks   I'm being 100% serious you know   everybody would say oh don't bother with   New York because Republicans don't win   New York I don't think that we're gonna   be in that position I think we're gonna   win New York I think we're gonna do   great in New York   don't forget Hillary she's not a New   Yorker and by the way in Arkansas and   she's really not from Arkansas either   but in Arkansas what do I have a twenty   five point lead   I think I have a twenty five point lead   you know she is from Arkansas but she's   really from Illinois so yeah thank you   I'm a real New Yorker folks I will say   this you will never get more of a New   Yorker if you want a president than   you're getting with me so I want to   thank Mike I want to thank the   Conservative Party I want to thank   everybody in this room I want to thank   my son Eric trump has been working and   his wife Laura and we have so many   supporters but I just want to say to you   we are going to play so hard we are   gonna play so hard and win we're gonna   win this state it's gonna shock people   and by the way you know if we win this   state it's over we win   okay we win so I appreciate the   endorsement of Mike always I really   appreciate being given this great honor   by the Conservative Party and I will   tell you Mike get up here for one second   come here come here come here I want to   thank you men do a hell of a job for   this man thank you thank you everybody   thank you thank you very much everybody   Thank you Thank You Karl   [Applause]   another round of applause for our   nominee have fun with Matt Lauer tonight   and I hope you had a good time enjoy the   rest of the evening get home safely   enjoy good night see you in the morning   dark and early

deal   nobody even knows about it she got the   questions in advance to essentially a   debate can you imagine no no no no can   you imagine if Donald Trump got the   questions in advance you know what they   do they reinvent the electric chair   that's what they you don't you don't   even hear about that gerroff did you   ever hear about this nobody is she got   and by the way behind you is one of your   great football players folks look at   this guy   and he is a man of god i will tell you   thank you thank you one of the greats   all those championships i don't know how   about green business yet think what do   you think they're going to be okay i   think he says yes w a new report from   the center of Public Integrity shows   that ninety six percent of so-called   journalists or reporters who've made   presidential donations this circle gauge   their money gave themselves gave   everything to crooked Hillary Clinton   can you believe they even want to try to   rig the election at the polling booths   so believe me this is a lot going on you   ever hear these people they say there's   nothing going on people that have died   ten years ago is still voted illegal   immigrants are voting I mean where are   the street smarts of some of these   politicians they are happening   so many cities are corrupt and voter   fraud is very very common the following   information comes straight from Pew   Research quote approximately 24 million   people one of every a voter   registrations in the United States are   no longer valid or significantly in   action one in eight more than 1.8   million deceased individuals right now   are listed as voters oh that's wonderful   well as they're gonna vote for me we'll   think about it right but I have a   feeling they're not gonna vote of the   1.8 million 1.8 million is voting for   somebody else approximately 2.75 million   people have registrations in more than   one state   [Applause]   can we love our police do we love our   police long   you can see they're getting angrier and   angrier with everyone now because   there's such a disturbance you people   then there is the issue of illegal   immigrants voting the following comes   from a 2014 report from the Washington   Post this article was entitled could   non-citizens decide the November   election here are some extras more than   fourteen percent of non-citizens in both   2008 and 2010 samples indicated that   they were registered to vote oh is that   wonderful because non-citizens tend to   favor Democrats to put it mildly Obama   won more than eighty percent of the   votes of non-citizens into 2008 sample   you know read about this right they   don't tell you about this your   politicians don't tell you about this   when they tell you how legitimate all of   these elections are they don't want to   tell you about this we find that this   participation was large enough to   plausibly account for Democratic   victories in various close elections   okay all right non citizen votes could   have given Senate Democrats the pivotal   60th vote needed to overcome filibusters   in order to pass health care reform and   many other reforms and other Obama   administration pry our priorities now it   continues it is possible that   non-citizens votes were responsible for   Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina   Obama won this state by 14,000 votes so   it turn out by five point one percent of   North Carolina's adult citizens and by   the way we're doing great in North   Carolina   but we don't want non-citizen voters if   that's okay dead all right to ask   [Music]   it could have provided his margin of   victory our system is also rigged by the   donors giving hundreds of millions of   dollars to Hillary Clinton's campaign   and again I will have spent over a   hundred million dollars of my campaign I   am controlling myself I'm working for   you folks   and they're all telling me what a great   job in what a big movement there's never   been anything like this in this country   and they all admitted even the enemies   back there admitted but if I don't win   it will be the greatest waste of time   energy and money that I will out what a   waste water waste they all say it won't   be a waste you'll be in the history   books let me do some folks I don't want   to be I want to be I want to win if we   win we will do something we will make   we're gonna make America great again   the reason Hillary Clinton pushes the   job-killing NAFTA a trans-pacific   partnership which you cannot let happen   into position and for complete oh don't   worry we're building the wall   [Applause]   who is going to pay for the wall 100 by   the way I'm not kidding one hundred   percent all of these partnerships and   four completely open borders she wants   open borders she wants people to poorer   course upwards we won't have a country   Fox is because her international donors   control every single movie manage if we   let the Clinton cartel run this   government history will record that 2017   was the year America lost its   independence so we will not let that   happen it is time   [Applause]   it is time to drain the swamp in   Washington DC this is why I'm proposing   a package of ethics reforms to make our   government honest once again when Bill   Clinton who was right about Obamacare   two weeks ago by the way said its brazen   Prison came into office he signed an   executive order saying if you work for   the White House for a federal agency you   can't Lobby the government for five   years after you leave but then President   Clinton did what the twin is always good   he rigged the system on his way out all   right Clinton lifted the executive order   so Clinton cronies like John Podesta   could start raking in cash so here's   what we as a group are announcing   tonight first I'm going to reinstitute a   five-year ban on all executive branch   officials lobbying the government for   five years after they leave   [Applause]   I'm going to ask office the past is bad   into law so that it cannot be lifted by   executive order what second I'm going to   ask us to institute its own five-year   ban on lobby by former members of   Congress and their stairs it's enough   I'm going to expand the definition of   lobbies so we closed all the loopholes   that former government officials used by   labeling themselves consultants advisors   all of these different things and they   get away with more I'm going to issue a   lifetime ban against senior executive   branch officials lobbying on behalf of a   foreign government   [Applause]   Jeff I'm going to ask others to pass a   campaign finance reform that prevents   registered foreign lobbies from raising   money in American elections and policy   this will go a long way to ending our   government corruption but we will end   economic stagnation also and that will   help my plan for the economy can be   summed up in three very beautiful words   jobs jobs jobs jobs taking our jobs away   they're going to Mexico to going all   over the place we're going to keep our   companies here folks they're not leaving   if they want to leave there will be   consequences you want and they won't   leave when they hear those consequences   they're not leaving believe me they're   not leaving our politicians have worked   for years to try and keep our companies   are so easy it's so easy you want to   leave you want to build you want to   build whatever you want to build cars   for it is leaving carry through so many   covers do so many you know we lost   seventy thousand factories seventy   thousand factories since the signing of   NAFTA I thought there's a typographical   error I figured maybe seven hundred   maybe seven thousand seventy thousand   factories at the center of my jobs plan   will be fixing our terrible trade deals   they are horrible 47 million Americans   earned poverty and 45 million Americans   are on right now food stamps we have   nearly an 800 billion dollar annual   trade in goods with the rest of the   world and the worst so-called recovery   by far since the Great Depression   could you see the jobs numbers the other   day horrible you saw our GDP still be in   my opinion less than 1% you know a China   goes to seven percent eight percent nine   percent slike a national catastrophe if   we're at less than one percent which is   what it will be it's like what else   we're not going to put up with it it's   the Clintons who gave us snap that he   cited remember that bill clinton signed   the worst straight deal in the history   of the world and the Clintons who gave   her China's entry into the world trade   organization here in Wisconsin do we   love Wisconsin   [Music]   [Applause]   you know why I'm here first so I have a   lot of friends but you know why I'm here   I'm here because everyone's calling me   everyone's calling saying we're gonna   win with God's   [Applause]   it's not so traditional now but it's not   so traditional for Republican to be in   this position mostly they say well we'll   have to skip Wisconsin not me we're   gonna witness conscience companies like   briggs and stratton has cut thousands of   manufacturing jobs and move them where   to china GE Healthcare recently closed   its Milwaukee location and shipped those   jobs to Mexico did you know that Sheriff   they disclosed up that's a lot of jobs   they shipped over to Mexico Johnson   Controls shutter to splints and   Milwaukee and west allis and move the   jobs to Mexico and move the jobs to   China and move the jobs all over the   place except to hear the list goes on   and on many many companies leaving   Wisconsin leaving everywhere they're   leaving our country we are living   through the single greatest jobs that in   the history of the world it's true our   companies are being raided our jobs are   being let go we end up with unemployment   and empty buildings they end up with   cash they end up with cash tremendous   factories like you've never seen   magnificent plants jobs all over the   place we end up with you know we end up   actually the two things unemployment   than drugs they end up with the cash we   end up with the drugs not so good a   trump administration is going to   renegotiate NAFTA stand up to China and   get along with China we don't get along   with China now and they rip us off and   stop the jobs from leaving our country   and I do a lot of business with John   after largest bank in the world as a   tenant and one of my buildings in   Manhattan it just wonderful i mean i   wish you up people r in our country we   like this mark equal they're smart   people we don't have smart people   running on   we have people that are incompetent we   have a president we have a president all   he wants to do is campaign for Hillary   Clinton so that she can W health care   for all he does is give this guy every   time you see him he's campaigning for   Clinton and frankly he ought to be   working on jobs he ought to be working   on the Second Amendment and the border   and all of these different part   he ought to be working on taking care of   our veterans life and our military   when here's a guy we go into motion we   go into Mosul now why don't we just go   in quietly right they used to call it a   sneak attack let's call it we want to do   at night it's an easy I've been reading   about it for four months now a primary   reason for going in was we wanted to get   the leaders of Isis right dick on folks   they got this for people they read the   same news papers and articles that we   read they said hey they're going to   attack bosal influence let's get the   hell out of here they're all of them how   stupid are open can you imagine the   great general george patton General   MacArthur I really had a lot of you know   what they're doing right is spinning in   their gray and I see we will be   attacking sometime next week I've been   reading about this for months and I   honestly a big big part of always hurt   and I always used to wonder why they   don't go in and but I didn't like   quietly bun right surprise remember that   used to call the element of surprise now   are relevant of surprises in four months   we will be attacking muscle I wonder   what general Flynn what are generals   think about that not too good not too   good i can tell you what general Flynn   as part of our plan to create at least   25 million jobs in 10 years we're going   to lower our business tax from   thirty-five percent to 15 we're going to   make our nation rich again would have   great companies we're going to have   great jobs and jobs are gonna start   coming back to America but to be rich   country we must also be a safe country   national security begins at the bottom   speaking in a secret meeting to a   foreign man Hillary Clinton said her   dream is for totally open trade they   could figure the rusty jobs and open   borders their grocery country between   over trade you jobs open borders your   country so you lost see jobs and your   country other than that she's doing a   great job my open trade she means   foreign countries can cheat us out of   millions of dollars and millions of jobs   and literally not millions of dollars   really it's really trillions upon   trillions of dollars by open border she   means totally unlimited immigration in a   secret speech to goldman says she said   citizens to what control immigration are   on American I don't think deplorable   right here we gave a bomb irredeemable   these are deplorable it's good to me   so Hilary thinks most of the country is   either deplorable or redeemable   unamerican racist or basement dwellers   that's what she called Bernie Sanders   people makes me well as all burning why   did you do it burning you know his   people are saying why can do it Bernie   what you do it put Bernie now is a rally   and a hundred people show up he could   have left a great market history you   want Hillary's plan includes although I   think we're going to get a lot of   burning people because one of the things   burning you is that we were being ripped   off Andre it's a big factor and we're   not only going to make that we're gonna   have a lot of trip we're going to make   great kids we could have a double   highway we're going to have things   coming back to us right now to one-way   highway out Hillary's plan includes open   borders with the Middle East meaning   generations of radicalism terrorism   spreading and growing within our shores   so let me state this as clearly as I can   if I'm elected president I am going to   keep radical Islamic terrorists a half   [Applause]   he won't even use the term and neither   will she we will also stop the crisis of   illegal immigration after day a trump   administration will secure and defend   our borders and yes we will build the   wall that we just talked about and you   will be you know when we got the   endorsement of all of the border patrol   agent 16,500 and ice

wouldn't take them back we would bring   them we would have a murder we would   have a drug look we would have the head   of gangs and gang members we bring them   back to their country they intelligently   said we don't want to take them out and   our guys would say oh yes okay and   Hillary Clinton never force these   criminals back into their own country   and I guarantee you not one time as   president would you see that happen at   one time there will be nope times when   we don't take these people and put them   into their country with that country's   telling us take them back

OvW5NSrE43A~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161015~Full Event: Donald Trump Rally in Bangor, Maine (10/15/2016) Trump Live Bangor Maine Speech~42601.0~4.71380472183~1103.0~85.0~   [Music]   what a great great crowd on a great day   in Maine I got to tell you so beautiful   out there little fur north from this   southern guy but up is so proud to be   with you and share with you the union   and common goal we have to make America   great again get this country get our   country on the right track American   people by three-to-one margin for years   down have found and believed in their   hearts and they're worried that our   country is on the wrong track and I'll   tell you what the fact is listen to me   now the American people are right we are   doing things in this country that are   detrimental to the decent American   citizens who go to work every day do the   right thing serve their country in a   myriad of different ways pay their taxes   and raise their children as best they   can in this difficult culture we live in   these are the people that have made this   country great and this things are   slipping away we're losing in sight we   have people in Washington who don't   understand the challenges that the   Middle American families are facing and   they're worried more about their   globalist fundraising friends than the   people that they're obligated by law to   serve   so let me ask you if you believe the   country is on the wrong track is due two   thirds seventy percent of the american   people do you think Hillary Clinton has   the guts the will and the drive to put   it on the right track absolutely you're   right she is part of the problem she   thinks we're on the right track she   wants to put the pedal to the metal and   make it worse as she's been doing   consistently I mean this is a huge   choice this may be our last chance to   get this country on the right track   again   you know they like them you know how   they feel about us what they talk about   evangelicals and and Catholics and   people of faith and people clinging to   guns and you know we're just not worth   listening to and they think but this is   a heartland of America this is who we   are it's our culture we have every right   to defend it and in advance   [Applause]   on the WikiLeaks with regard to   immigration I've been working on that   for so many years and I used to say   first with bafflement how is it that any   bill we offer can pass on immigration as   long as it doesn't work they won't pass   anything that works they'll pass   anything that doesn't work and say   they've done something of value the   American people have asked and they are   good and right indecent to say so we   want a lawful system of immigration one   that serves the national interest the   people's interests of this country and   one that we can be proud of isn't that a   good thing to ask of our government but   one of the politicians done what are the   politicians done   well what is the politicians done in   response nothing in response to the good   people of America's decent and right   plea to them they've done nothing and   now we know why you saw that email did   that speech Hillary Clinton gave to some   big bank foreign bank and paid a bunch   of money to give the speech and she said   what she believed in what I'm using her   words open borders now   that is a radical bill that wall is   right yeah   friends friends that is that's a radical   position I'm not aware of a single   nation in the world I've heard a lot of   people over the years say they just   believe in open borders that there is   but his Donald Trump says open borders   if you don't have borders you don't have   a country so he is exactly right about   that and people have advocated that but   it's an extreme radical position that   cannot be the position of the next   president of the United States of   America you know also she said in that   same speech that she believed in a trade   union throughout the entire western   hemisphere where there's free movement   of goods and people just like the   European Union this is a radical   position for the United States of   America take our British friends just by   the skin of their teeth extracted   themselves from the trap of Brussels and   maintain maintain their independence   they called it independence day when   they managed to get out of the European   Union so we absolutely don't need to go   down that road and that and she said   that's explicitly where she wants to   take it the country and both with regard   to immigration and trade everything   they've done clinton and obama over the   years has been to advance that agenda so   why would we deny doubt what she said in   this me i have had the great pleasure   over the years to work with Olympia   Snowe and Susan Collins and we   understand   we we understand the need to fix timber   in this country and protect the land   owning timber people so I just want to   say to you I understand the extreme   nature of some of the actions have been   taken to reduce timber harvesting and   the bill t to have renewable forest in   our country and and I share that concern   with you very much well there are a lot   of things that are going on I just want   to thank you give me the opportunity to   be with you it's such a pleasure to be   here I want to introduce to you at this   time man I have the greatest respect for   Ronald Reagan named mean to be United   States attorney in Alabama in 1981 it's   part of the Department of Justice I was   so proud of I believe we have the best   Department of Justice then it's ever   been I know I'm biased but it was a   fabulous Department of Justice with   integrity crime-fighting people   dedicated public safety or eliminating   drugs and that kind of thing in our   country and we had great leadership the   top guy one of the very top guys in the   department who did all the criminal   enforcement was our friend Rudy Giuliani   [Applause]   [Music]   we're so happy to be here with this very   enthusiastic crowd and i wanna i wanna i   want to begin i want to begin by noting   a difference between these two   candidates Donald Trump and Hillary   Clinton Donald Trump is out there every   day two three times a day for time today   fighting for your vote seeking your vote   because he wants to fight for you in   Washington and what's she doing she's   sitting at home resting we want a   president that rests all the time she   sitting at home resting I remember I   can't say I remember I'm not that old   but I read history and 11 can recall the   election between Dewey and Truman and on   the night of the election Chicago think   of I think it was the Chicago Tribune   had a headline that said Dewey defeats   Truman except know Truman defeated doing   you know why because truly got on a   train and he campaigned 20 hours a day   for two straight months he went   everywhere and Dewey kind of SAT home   took it for granted and thought he was   gonna be an just inaugurated and   coronated well she's at home and she   figures she's going to get crown   president she's got all the press on the   side right right maybe a couple of a   couple of exceptions couple of   exceptions with the presses on her side   all this wikileaks stuff comes out that   wouldn't ended in anybody else's   candidacy it had been over with oh the   speeches the speeches where she said you   have a private position in a public   position you know who has a private   position in a public with us you know we   called them in New York I don't know   what you call it we call them Elias that   what do you call him in Maine what what   what do you what do you what do you call   somebody who destroys 33,000 emails   after they get a subpoena from Congress   think it think you called him a criminal   I don't I'm just I'm kind of like just   talking like normal people you your   clothes you clothes somebody like that a   criminal what do you what what do you   call somebody who gets interviewed by   the FBI and they put in front of her a   secret top secret document has these   little C's on it and she said they did   you know what that cement she said no no   III didn't know what it meant well it   means confidential confidential is a   category of top-secret information and   she said well she didn't know that she   said that she thought maybe it was   something to an alphabetical order the   FBI investigation was so bad the FBI   agent didn't ask her did you see an A or   B or D or an F what a bunch of lies what   a bunch of live she says she can't   remember her exit interview she can't   remember her exit interview from the   Department of State because her   concussion she lost her memory and the   FBI never went to go get the medical   records to see did she really lose a   memory or was she lying   and by the way if she lost her memories   for that long we kind of have a problem   anyway right well in any event Hillary   on november eighth and the Clintons and   all their shenanigans and corruption and   scandals and it's all going to be behind   us and we're going to have we're gonna   have a chance to build an America that   is focused on the things that are most   important to the people now the things   that are the most important to the power   brokers and the lobbyists and all the   special interest and the press and the   academics and everybody who lives up and   here somewhere we the reason Donald   Trump is campaigning all over America is   number one he wants to show you he has   the energy and the drive and the passion   to fight for you he's not gonna make   he's not going to make he's not going to   make dumb deals like she did resetting   the relationship with Russia giving up   giving up the defense of the czech   republic and and poland for nothing he's   not going to make a ridiculous deal like   they made with the Ayatollah so he's   going to become a nuclear power in 10   years he's not going to make a   ridiculous deal like NAFTA that took   jobs out of Maine and sent them down to   Mexico   he believes in the basic notion the   President Kennedy and President Reagan   had that you're always better off with   tax cuts you're always better off when   you put more money back in your pocket   rather than by taking that money for the   government don't you don't you think   wouldn't you like wouldn't you like to   have wouldn't you like to have about ten   or twenty percent more of your income in   your pocket do you think you would   handle that better than the government   handles it well that's what the Donald   Trump candidacy is about it's about the   people it's about restoring the   government to you it's about getting rid   of the crooks and the rigged system in   Washington it's about replacing it with   a system in which people are going to   have lower taxes people are going to   have more jobs because we're going to   negotiate the trade deals correctly   rather than incorrectly we're going to   stand up to Islamic radical terrorism   and stop it first we're going to say it   radical Islamic terrorism   and then we're going to Faye who am I   going to defeat them and here's the way   it's going to end it's going to end the   way Ronald Reagan said the Cold War was   going to end it's gonna end this way   they lose we win that's it so he'll be   out here in a few minutes to tell you   his plan for America I want you to know   that we unlike the other candidates   sitting at home resting and practicing   and do it all you know it must be hard   for her because she has a public   position in a private position so   probably takes about four or five days   to figure out which one is she going to   give us a public one over a private one   I hope during the debate mr. Trump a   slur you know is this your public   positioning a private positioner well   maybe some cases she has three or four   positions one thing we know she doesn't   do is tell the truth now I can tell you   this man tells the truth he'll be out   here in a few minutes and I want to make   sure that main vote for Donald J Trump   for president of the United State   [Applause]   to make America great again please   welcome the next president of the United   States mr. Donald J Trump   [Music]   a lot of people in maine's boy it's the   nice crowd in 24 days we are going to   win the state of Maine and we are going   to win back the White House make sure   you get your absentee ballots in get a   min as soon as you can together we're   going to deliver real change that puts   once again America first my economic   agenda can be send up and this is so   important three very simple words are   you ready jobs jobs jobs we're going to   renegotiate our absolutely terrible   trade deals and illegal immigration stop   the massive inflow of refugees reduced   searching crime cut taxes and   regulations lift the restrictions on   American energy and common core   and we repeal and replace the disaster   known as Obamacare we are also going to   replace a failed political class that   has betrayed our workers spent trillions   on endless foreign wars without victory   and destroyed our middle class your jobs   will come roaring back under a trump   administration your incomes will go up   under a trump administration your taxes   will go way down under a trump   administration   and crooked Hillary is lifting your   taxes way up   [Applause]   your energy bills will go way down under   a trump administration your companies   won't be leaving Main under a trump   administration not anymore they're not   going to believe it we're going to be a   rich country again we're also going to   end government corruption Hillary speaks   in secret to Goldman Sachs sharing a   private position then lies to you the   public with her public position and by   the way WikiLeaks just came out with   lots of really unbelievable things just   minutes ago fact I almost delayed this   speech by about two hours it's so   interesting but I decided you're more   important than anybody   it's all a big beautiful fraud Hillary   Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after a   congressional subpoena that's after a   caftan she got a congressional subpoena   and she deleted 33,000 email she lied to   Congress under oath she made 13 iPhones   disappear some with a hammer and now   we're learning two boxes of email   evidence and other things are   mysteriously missing the WikiLeaks   documents show that the Clinton campaign   was colluding directly with the   Department of State and justice to the   investigation and on the investigation   of her emails and her illegal server   that put our national security at grave   risk Hillary Clinton should have been   prosecuted and gone to jail for what she   the FBI and the Department of Justice   created a fraud in allowing Hillary   Clinton to get away with her terrible   terrible crimes and I guarantee you that   Clinton's are laughing at them right now   the directors performance in Congress   coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine   meeting on the tarmac   which takes about three minutes out of   the 39 minutes is one of the lowest   points in the history of the Justice   Department and in the history of the FBI   instead of being held accountable   Hillary is running for president in what   looks like too many people a totally   rigged election the election is being   rigged by corrupt media pushing false   allegations and outright lies in an   effort to elect Hillary Clinton   president but we are going to stop it we   are not going to back down   false stories all made up lies lies no   witnesses no nothing all big lies it's a   rigged system and they take these lies   and they put them on front pages this is   a rigged system folks but we're not   going to let it happen we're not going   to let it happen we are seeing what's   going on we've only just begun to fight   Americans have had it with the years and   decades of Clinton corruption and that's   what it is you go back to white water or   the cattle buyer remember the cattle by   they cattle by what a disgrace that was   this will finally be the year the   American people say enough is enough   enough is enough   speaking in secret to a foreign bank   Hillary Clinton said her dream is for   total open trade and open borders there   go the rest of your jobs there go the   rest of you jobs Hillary and Bill raised   millions of dollars from global interest   groups who have no allegiance to our   country or our workers whatsoever they   couldn't care less by open trade she   means foreign countries can cheat us out   of millions of jobs and trillions and   trillions of dollars by open border she   means totally unlimited immigration   pouring into our country either we win   the election or we lose the country and   this is the last time we have this is it   november eighth this is it we're going   to either win or we're going to have a   whole different country and it's never   going to come back never comes back   [Applause]   Hillary's plan includes an open border   with the Middle East meaning generations   of radicalism within our shores she   refuses to mention the term radical   Islamic terrorism Obama refuses to use   that time and unless you're going to   define a problem you're never going to   solve it and she will never solve it if   you remember Isis came out of a vacuum   while she was Secretary of State came   right out of a vacuum in Iraq the way   they got out should have never been in   the war in the first place but we were   but the way they got out was disgraceful   and Isis formed and now she's saying I   will beat Isis so Isis started from   nothing and now they're in 32 different   countries way to go Hillary great job   everything she touches turns bad just   take a look at her record every single   and if she's president this country is   going to go for a ride downward like   we've never seen it before more years of   an incompetent president barack obama   was an incompetent president it'll be   four more years of an incompetent   president how about the Iran deal where   they gave them four hundred million in   cares about that but but the 400 million   wasn't 400 million it was 1.7 billion in   cash   that would fill up this side of the   arena these people how about the 800   people bad ones that we're going to be   deported you know to be deported from   this country you got to be bad because   we don't deport you got to be bad so   that 800 people going to be deported but   they made a mistake and they became   United States citizens and staff made a   mistake now why did they make that   mistake folks you know in Maine I have   great friends and made their very   streetwise even though you have the most   beautiful surroundings probably in the   world they're very streetwise you really   do you also have a big plot I'll end up   here I'll tell you but but they're very   streetwise very smart people my friends   are various want people so why do you   think the 800 people went from being   deported into being citizens you know   what that it okay but they were wrong   because it was an 800 turned out to be   1800 okay citizens so I said undo it   undo it they said well that wouldn't be   constitutional how stupid away hey how   stupid a week how stupid are we we have   not anymore you're right not in   that stuff won't be happening I promise   you she wants us to follow the path of   France and Germany and import terrorism   directly into the United States so with   all of the people coming in we're going   to have problems like you wouldn't   believe you just watch and she wants   five hundred and fifty percent more   coming in from Syria than the thousands   and thousands that our president quote   president has coming in so let me state   this as clearly as I can if I'm elected   president I'm going to keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of this   country   we'll of our country it'll all be   America first America first we will also   stop the crisis of illegal immigration a   trump administration will secure and   defend our borders and yes we will build   the wall   and Mexico will pay for the wall   100 we have the first-ever endorsement   from our ice and Border Patrol officers   and agent first-ever first time they've   ever endorsed the presidential candidate   and both the Border Patrol agents and   ice have just done it I stood at last   week it was just reported that a man   deported from our country ten times in   six years has been charged with the   raping of a twelve-year-old girl in   August Texas police arrested a serial   illegal immigrant rapist who had been   deported five times his victims include   a 68 year old woman with a cane who took   her his offer to drive him look she   wanted to drive home took the offer to   have a drive home he left her on the   side of a dirt road what kind of a   government allows its own people to   suffer like we're suffering and we're   suffering crime after crime horror show   after horror show and we're gonna have   very strong borders that we're going to   have the wall but we're going to have   people come into a country with them but   they're going to come in to our country   legally legally they're going to come in   Legally as Secretary of State Hillary   Clinton allowed thousands and thousands   of criminal aliens to be released   because their home countries wouldn't   take them back that's because their home   countries are smart I promise you don't   want they have a killer they want to   bring them back to a certain country the   country says we don't want them we're   not taking them turn your plane around   get out of here we're not taking him   you're not landing you're not get out of   here Hillary Clinton was Secretary of   State she said okay we'll take them I   promise you that won't happen once not   once those countries are taken there   people drug lords gang members those   countries are taking those people back   among those she allowed to go for me was   a criminal alien who had previously been   convicted for shooting a girl in the   head after his release he viciously   murdered a young girl named Casey   Chadwick in Connecticut you're probably   read about it a wall will not only keep   out criminals but it will also keep out   the drugs and heroin from pouring into   Maine and poisoning your youth and I   just left New Hampshire and like New   Hampshire you have a tremendous drug   problem drug overdoses in Maine are on   at a record pace I've outlined today a   detailed plan to stop the opioid crisis   my plan begins with a strong border it   includes the prosecution of drug dealers   and dramatically expands access to   life-saving treatments that will help   people unchain themselves from this   terrible terrible and very hard to get   rid of addiction and there are ways of   doing but if we're going to bring back   hope to suffering Americans we must also   solve our jobs and economic crisis   because we have a tremendous jobs crisis   so many of our jobs have gone to Mexico   have gone to places like China into   schools and airports the state of Maine   has lost nearly one in three   manufacturing jobs since NAFTA signed by   Bill Clinton and supported by crooked   Hillary since China entered the World   Trade Organization another bill clinton   disaster also backed by hillary 70,000   and i thought this was a typographical   error as he can't be 70,000 we went back   at 70,000 I thought 7700 must be a   mistake 70,000   factories have shut down or left the   United States as you know us you know   that's 15 factory's closing a day on   average can you believe it 15 a day in   the country we're living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world what's happened to our country   is the greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world there's never been   a thing like happened to our country and   i will stop it if i win day one we're   going to announce our plans to totally   renegotiate the disaster known as NAFTA   and we don't get the deal we want we'll   leave NAFTA and start over again and   make much better trade deals I like   trade I'm for trade up for free trade   but it has to also be fair trade but I'm   for trade where things benefit our   country   we get unemployment and we get drugs   naked can we don't they get job you will   get back you will leave me that way to   move up and start over again and make   much better trade deals i like going is   short range I think 300 and I'm a tassel   to be fair part of our plan but I'm   trade where things better going   everywhere job is a bathroom 30 flowers   on three forty percent we want a two-way   Highway not a one-way right now we have   a one-way highway right into Mexico we   get unemployment and we get drugs they   get cash they get jobs and they get   factories not going to be that way   anymore fo we're going to start making   things again in America as part of our   plan to bring back our jobs we're going   to lower our business tax from   thirty-five percent to fifteen percent   which is almost getting to be the record   low and by the way thirty-five percent   major countries thirty-five percent the   highest anywhere in the world we will   lower taxes massively in all Americans   Hillary will raise taxes and raise your   taxes by a lot that's what she she plans   to do just take a look our biggest   reductions will be for the working and   middle-class this includes letting   parents deduct the cost of childcare   Reagan's tax cuts in the 80s and   Kennedy's tax cuts in the 60s brought us   tremendous growth my economic reforms on   taxes trade regulation and American   energy will produce at least 25 million   jobs over the next decade   it's the most pro-growth economic plan   in American history and it's gotten some   wonderful reviews we're also going to   protect the right of people and the   people of Maine to use their own land   you know what we're talking about   President Obama with the support of   politicians like Hillary Clinton issued   an executive order two months ago making   over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new   National Monument   [Music]   that's a lot of acres I'll tell you no   consideration was made for local   concerns impacts on jobs or the main   forestry sector which is such an   important sister like so important for   you and nobody even thought of it nobody   even thought they don't care about you   no approval by Congress your state   legislature totally opposed it it's just   another federal outreach that's going to   do much more harm much much more harm   than it is good and it's made a lot of   people in Maine very angry because the   people of Maine have great common sense   give me a break what are they doing   Obama and Clinton don't care that this   area badly needs jobs and growth and   that this decision done at the stroke of   a pen without the support of the local   community undermines the people that   live and work right here in Maine that's   a bad bad bill but we're going to turn   it all around believe me America's   comeback begins or November race and   have a big big come   here are some of the amazing things   we're going to do for our country   starting in 2017 we're going to have the   biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan   we're going to eliminate all of that   horrible job killing unnecessary   regulation we are going to defend   religious liberty which is under seas   we're also going to get rid of the   Johnson Amendment you know what that is   we're going to reduce the cost of   college tuition big league we're going   to provide school choice to every   low-income child in America school   choice and by the way we're going to get   rid of common core we're bringing our   education local local   we're going to rebuild our depleted   military our great great people have   equipment that's ancient and we are   going to take care of finally take care   of properly our incredible veterans   [Applause]   we are going to support the men and   women of law enforcement great people   we will oh we will I am so looking   forward to this repeal and replace   Obamacare say if the Second Amendment   the National Rifle Association endorsed   Donald Trump the earliest endorsement   NRA they've ever given to a presidential   candidate we're going to save you Second   Amendment we are going to appoint   justices to the United States Supreme   Court who will uphold and defend the   Constitution of the United States   you have 24 days to make every dream you   ever dreamed for your country for your

P-nP2L_vCoY~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161030~Full Speech: Donald Trump FANTASTIC Rally in Las Vegas, Nevada (10/30/2016) Trump Las Vegas Speech~19184.0~4.90243911743~680.0~17.0~   our vets this is a movement rug this is   not like even maybe about me this is   about common sense it's about doing the   right thing   [Music]   I   [Music]   thank you very much   this is their record crowd I want to   thank the great owner of this hotel and   his incredible wife she's an incredible   woman sheldon adelson and really   incredible people and they've been so   supportive and we appreciate it we   appreciate it very much and Phil Ruffin   one of our great supporters is here   tonight Phil we love Phil and we're   doing great in the polls were winning   many national polls and we're ahead in   many states including your great state   and North Carolina and Ohio when Florida   in Iowa and so many others and just so   you know these polls came out yesterday   and today this was before the blow up on   Friday these polls are from before the   blow up so we'll see where the cusp of a   really incredible historic change that   transfers power from a failed political   establishment and returns that power to   our families communities and citizens in   nine days we are going to win the state   of Nevada no bad   the state of Nevada right you know I   don't know if you know but everybody in   New York says it the other way and I did   that once and I never will do it again   believe but we're gonna win the state of   Nevada and we're going to win back the   White House early voting is underway so   make sure you get to the pulse who's   voted that's like fifty percent if   anybody wants to leave right now go   ahead I won't be insulted there's plenty   of people outside that want to take your   place okay now make sure you vote   because otherwise this incredible   movement that we've created together we   won't get there and that will be very   very bad for all of us it would be very   bad for the country a trump   administration will immediately repeal   and replace Obamacare   it's just been announced that the   citizens of Nevada are going to   experience a massive massive in fact I   don't want to tell you what the numbers   I won't because I'll you'll walk out of   here depressed double-digit hike in   there Obama care premiums for the year   10 of Nevada's 16 counties will have   only Obamacare and think of it you can   have one exchange insurer to choose from   they are in a very good position to   negotiate with you aren't they not with   Trump we're going to get rid of it and   we're going to have health care that is   so good and so much less expensive   because Obamacare forgetting about the   cost which is ridiculous it's no good it   doesn't work and your deductibles and so   high you're never going to be able to   use it so Obamacare is a catastrophe for   your state in Minnesota with the premium   increase will be close to sixty percent   the Democratic governor has just said   the Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable Hillary Clinton wants to   double down on Obamacare making it even   more expensive in fact much more   expensive   my contract with the American voter   outlines a plan to repeal and replace   Obamacare and I'm asking for your vote   so we can save health care for every   family in your state and in this country   will change also means getting rid of   the corruption in Washington you've been   seeing a little corruption right you've   been seen system is rigged it's rigged   little corruption you've been watching   as you've heard it was just announced on   Friday that the FBI is reopening their   investigation into the criminal and   illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton   Hillary has nobody but herself to blame   for her mounting legal problems her   criminal action was willful deliberate   intentional and purposeful Hillary set   up an illegal server for the obvious   purpose of shielding her criminal   conduct from public disclosure and   exposure she set up this illegal server   knowing full well that her actions put   our national security at risk and put   the safety and security of your children   at risk to cover up her crimes she   bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after   receiving a congressional subpoena   after after after after she gets a   subpoena and she deletes and bleaches   and nobody even ever heard of bleaching   did anybody ever hear bleaching you know   why it's such an expensive process but   it makes them go away but I have a   feeling they've just found a lot of them   don't you think have a phone Puma they   just found a lot of them we never   thought we were going to say thank you   to Anthony Weiner   [Applause]   she made 13 phones disappear some with a   hammer she lied to Congress under oath   she lied to the FBI many times and then   two boxes of email evidence just   recently went mysteriously missing then   you have the WikiLeaks revelations which   have exposed criminal corruption at the   highest levels of our government Hillary   put the office of Secretary of State up   for sale and if she ever did get the   chance which we're not gonna let her   have she'd put the Oval Office up for   sale also you have no doubt about that   yet now it's reported that the   Department of Justice is fighting the   FBI that's because the Department of   Justice is trying so hard to protect   Hillary Clinton   they didn't try to protect our generals   they didn't try to protect a lot of   other people how can the Attorney   General be involved in this case or tell   the FBI what to do when the Attorney   General violated sanctity of law by   secretly meeting with Bill Clinton the   husband of the possible target of the   investigation and a possible target   himself in an airplane on the tarmac in   Arizona   remember he was gonna play golf remember   but he just happened to be at the   airport hanging around and the Attorney   General's playing drove by right and   he's all isn't that up oh yes oh gee   let's say hello let's say hello just it   was a chance meeting they said right   well the meeting lasted 39 minutes and   they supposedly talked about golf and   grandchildren so I give two minutes to   golf I give five minutes to   grandchildren but what they probably   really talked about was the Attorney   General's reappointment should Hillary   Clinton become president which I don't   think is gonna happen   because of this highly inappropriate   meeting at best the Attorney General   took herself essentially out of the case   and put director Comey in charge of   making decisions you saw that   decision-making process so why is she   now allowed to fight so hard to get   someone who is so obviously guilty on so   many different fronts off the hook in   fact it was publicly reported that   sources close to Hillary Clinton said   and she actually I think said it to the   papers that she was thinking of   reappointing attorney general Lynch she   was thinking she said it I mean it was a   statement she made and effectively I   guess he'd call that a bribe wouldn't   you wouldn't it could bribe how could   she say they're gonna make a decision on   her and you're talking about you're   gonna reappoint she said it publicly I   believe when I heard it I found it a   little bit hard to believe that she'd   say that this is what we mean when we   say the system is rigged trick what   makes us exceptional is that we are a   nation of laws and that we are all equal   under those laws Hillary's corruption   shreds the principles on which our   nation was founded when the powerful can   get away with anything because they have   the money and the connections to rig the   system then the people lose hope and   confidence in the future of their   country corruption is corrosive to the   soul of a democracy and it must be   stopped that we're going to stop   [Applause]   because we have one ultimate check on   Hillary's corruption and that is the   power of the vote the power of the world   the only way to beat the corruption is   to show up and vote by the tens of   millions including millions of people   voting for the first time in their lives   [Applause]   there was a great guy on television that   I have to tell you about it his name was   Sid Miller from Texas oh they know Sid   Miller we created yet another star but   he was on this morning he was on Fox and   a lot of you saw him and he said you   know these New Yorkers have it all wrong   you guys have it all wrong he's from   Texas wearing a big white hat smart guy   he said you know in Texas I kept reading   where we're even and I said wow I don't   think so because I see the enthusiasm   but the voting started he said I gotta   tell you we have more people voting now   that we've ever had ever in an election   they're all coming from all over there   people we've never seen before they'd   never voted before or they haven't voted   for 20 years and they're all voting for   Trump and when they say then he said and   when I listen to these guys talking and   I know every one of them because these   are the most honest I tell you what   these are the most dishonest human   beings right back   [Applause]   for instance when we tell them to turn   the cameras to show this incredible   record crowd record for this ballroom   this is the record for this ballroom   Sheldon told me that himself   record   they don't show it you're wasting your   time they don't show it because they're   dishonest because they don't want to   show the crowds that we get the biggest   ever in the history of this country   there's never been a movement like this   and they don't want to show it and we're   going to go into it in a couple of   seconds but they are very dishonest the   media is very very dishonest show the   crowd why don't you show the crowd   turned the cameras   they'll get up a couple of them get up   they say Donald Trump spoke today before   a small crowd it's disgusting the other   day a man got up we had 17,000 people he   said Donald Trump spoke in front of a   few thousand people well few to me means   three I don't know that's the way I grew   up when I hear a few thousand people   that sort of means to me like three   anyway very very dishonest people but   Sid Miller said we've never had anything   like this it's fifty percent higher than   it has ever been before in Texas and he   said we're going to win and he wasn't   for me he said Trump is going to win by   massive numbers bigger than anyone's   ever seen and he said so I don't know   what you people are talking about on   television where they're saying the vote   in Texas is going to be very close he   said I don't know what you people are   talking about you must be talking about   a different Texas and the one I'm from   so we love the people in Texas and I   know whats going and you know what else   the same thing is happening in Florida   the same things happening in North   Carolina is happening all over because   people are sick and tired of stupidity   and deals and look at Iran look at the   Iran deal they're sick and tired of the   Iran deal they don't want to be giving   Iran 1.7 billion in cash   be from here up to the ceiling they   don't want to remember three weeks ago   they had 800 people that were they were   getting ready to deport right you saw   this right they had them that they were   tough anybody that gets deported from   this country believe me they have to be   tough so they have 800 little mistake   instead of deporting them they all   became United States citizens   and I'll tell you that's not the worst   of them the worst of it wasn't 800   people it was 1800 people okay so   congratulations you have some wonderful   new citizens of this country and then   why is it that's okay fix the problem   that's okay fix it they said that   wouldn't be constitutional give me a   break all right so we're stuck 1.7   billion in cash to Iran can you believe   can you imagine their eyes when they saw   that money being brought in by truck can   you imagine did you ever see what a   million dollars looks like in cash it's   a lot of that's a lot of money 1.7   billion in cash and then what do they do   they grab our sailors are 10 sailors   destroy their lives humiliate those   people instead of saying hey listen you   were in our waters you got to get over a   little bit they you Milly ate the   sailors they humiliate our country and   they would have kept them except they're   150 billion dollar payment started the   next day okay stupid they're not and   people are tired of it we're tired was   sick and tired of it and don't forget I   was on the other side for a long time   folks I understand that side very well   and it's a good life but I love this   country I love the people of this   country and we're going to change it   we're going to change we're gonna we're   gonna do it right   so go out and vote with all your heart   and soul and we're going to make America   great again that i can tell you okay   [Applause]   restoring honesty to our government and   the rule of law to our society will be   one of my truly highest priorities now   we have a lot we have to rebuild our   military we have to create borders we   have to do so much but that's going to   be right up there my contract with the   American voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption I want the entire   corrupt Washington establishment to hear   and heed the words that we all not me we   have to say when we win on November rain   we are going to Washington DC and we are   going to drain the swamp   true   you know I told people the other day   drain the swamp i said i don't really   like that expression this was two weeks   ago i said i don't love that expression   so hokey I thought it was hokey I said   you know and all of a sudden I I said oh   I hate to use this it's sort of like it   doesn't work correct and I said it two   weeks ago to a big crowd and I said it   and the place went crazy then I said it   a second time and the place went even   crazier and then the third time like you   they started saying it before I said it   and all of a sudden i decided i love   that expression it's a great Explorer   crazy right drain this one   [Applause]   thank you you know a man who loved Las   Vegas was Frank Sinatra and he had as we   like Frank Sinatra Frank Sinatra he was   great and when he originally heard and   sang for the first time my way how do we   like my way yes but he didn't like it   but then he sang it a couple of times   and then it went to number one and all   of a sudden he loved it okay so he loved   that's the way it works you never know   at the core of my contract is my plan to   bring back our jobs right   [Applause]   right now 70 million American women and   children live in poverty or near the   brink of poverty forty-three percent of   african-american school-age children are   living in poverty thirty-four percent of   Hispanic school-age children live in   poverty this is unacceptable in our   country it's unacceptable in America as   your president I will go into the   poorest communities and work on a   national plan for revitalization we will   break decades of failure and prove that   real change is possible if we simply cut   our ties with the failed politicians and   politics of the past   America has lost one third of its   manufacturing jobs since bill clinton   signed nafta   and Hilary loved it America and this is   something that every time I say they   always because it sounds so crazy I   thought it was a typo I thought it was   700 factories or 7,000 maybe America has   lost seventy thousand factories since   China entered the World Trade   Organization another bill and hillary   back deal we're living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   our world what's happened to our jobs   the greatest jobs theft all because our   politicians are either incompetent or   they've gotten so much campaign   contributions or other things or other   thing and the special interest you know   special interest like what's happening   but we're getting wiped out you go to   Michigan you go to I mean you go to New   England you look at areas around here   you look at what's happened it's a one   lane highway into Mexico no way out

to do that's all he   wants to do if you said building apart   but he wouldn't know how to go about it   okay all he dispels the biggest in the   world I said how his business he said   unbelievable it's unbelievable we're in   the United States no not at all in   Mexico it's the seventh wonder of the   world so we've got it we've got to have   we got to change things folks a trump   administration will stop the horrible   horrible horrible trans-pacific   partnership we will renegotiate NAFTA   and we are going to stand up to China's   currency manipulation I have great   relationships with China but their   currency manipulation what they do to   our country is unbelievable we have a   trade balance think of this we have a   deficit trade deficit with China almost   500 billion dollars   here we own a 1.5 trillion dollars   that's a good at they come in they take   our jobs and make our product they make   a fortune and we owe them 1.5 trillions   good act but we'll get it solved I have   great relations with China made a lot of   money with China the biggest bank in the   world is a tenant of mine in Manhattan   it's from China biggest bank in the   world

appreciate   that that was really nice we will also   keep our nation safe thank you thank you   thank you thank you very much we're   going to keep our nation safe from a   thing called terrorism Hillary Clinton   wants to increase Syrian refugees   pouring into our country by five hundred   and fifty percent that's over Obama's   numbers that's over the thousands and   thousands that are already coming in   through Obama when I'm elected president   we will suspend the Syrian refugee   program have no choice and we will keep   radical Islamic terrorists the hell out   of our country believe me   but we're also going to work to build   safe havens over there and we're going   to get the Gulf states to pay for we   don't have to pay for it they have   plenty of money we're going to get the   Gulf states to pay for it and they will   pay for it and we have to help the   people but we just can't do this anymore   folks we have problems we don't need to   be the great the Great Trojan horse   modern day version great trojan or it's   not going to be us a trump   administration will also secure and   defend the borders of the united states   and yes we will build a wall   [Applause]   Sheldon you have a great great hotel but   I tell you we could have made this   ballroom a little bit larger maybe could   have been at large this is some great   space and we also have by the way the   legendary Phil Ruffin of Las Vegas where   is Phil where is I get him over here   Keith he employs thousands of people and   he's a great guy Hilary has pledged open   borders and supports sanctuary cities   countless Americans are killed by   illegal immigrants because our   government refuses to do its job right   here in your state 20 year old Brian   coursing was shot and paralyzed by an   illegal immigrant he fought for his life   in the hospital for 17 days ultimately   he died Brian was a basketball star   loved by everybody with dreams of   becoming a firefighter right here on   Mother's Day in 2009 Carson City born   beautiful beautiful person just an   incredible person Renee Angelo was out   driving looking for a job when he was   shot in the head and murdered by a   previously deported illegal immigrant   gang member everybody said we must get   him out of our country we must   incarcerate him we must do something   because this guy was brutal Renee was   pulled from his vehicle and left to die   on the side of a road a good Samaritan   who thought there had been a car   accident stopped to help and he was also   shot the illegal immigrant killer had a   previous conviction as an accessory to   murder in Carson City and he had a   record as long as your arm but the Obama   administration didn't want to put him   out   Josh Wilkerson whose mother I've gotten   to know during this campaign was   murdered at the age of 17 Josh a student   in a high school and a good student was   tortured strangled and beaten to death   by the illegal immigrant and then his   body was set on fire and there are so   there are so many of these stories when   I become president this crime wave will   end and it will end very very quick   [Applause]   we will end illegal immigration we will   deport all criminal illegal immigrants   you have a lot of people that are   walking around and it the great thing   our local police they know who they are   they know I'm better than they know   their own family and we will get them   out now when Hilary brought him out that   bring him back to their country and the   country very intelligently wouldn't take   him right and so would bring him back   would release him into our society she   would always let him come back she   didn't want to make waves that will   never ever happen once not once with me   we were also so important by the way the   Border Patrol agents of this country and   ice both of them they'd never endorsed a   candidate for president before both   groups every one of them both groups   endorsed Donald Trump so Napoli we will   also repeal the obama-clinton defense   seek Western rebuild are badly depleted   military with the greatest people in the   world but we need help we have the   endorsements of over 200 Admirals and   Generals and 22 medal of honor   recipients and I want to thank general   Flynn for being a great guy great man   our our Air Force is the smallest and   oldest in its history and my plan calls   for building new fighter jets oh you   know what this is Nellis Nellis Air   Force Coast you could have nice new plan   Nellis Air Force Base did you ever see   where our fighter jets are so old that   we can't get parts anymore for these are   planes and services so old we can't get   parts that's going to change the enemy   has better planes than us and they buy   them from us or they take them we also   need a new foreign policy that puts   America first again America first   Hillary in our failed Washington   establishment have spent six trillion   dollars on wars in the Middle East and   now it's in worse shape I mean think of   it all of that money all of those lives   and it's in far worse shape than it ever   has been by a factor of 10 they've   dragged us into foreign wars they've   made us less safe and these awards that   they never win we don't win we don't win   it anything we don't win a trade we   don't win a Wars they've left our   borders wide open at home and they've   shipped our jobs and wealth to other   countries to all Americans I say it is   now time for real leadership we're going   to have real leadership   [Applause]   so sad so sad thank you thank you   and closing just think about what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trump administration we're going to have   the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan   [Applause]   we will eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation we will cancel   every illegal Obama executive order   and by the way Hillary Clinton just in   case you don't know it you do know she   wants to raise your taxes substantially   we're lowering you textin she wants to   raise your taxes substantially we're   going to rebuild our military and take   care of our great veterans or veterans   are going to be taking proper care of   for once and for all will reduce surging   crime and support the incredible men and   women of law enforcement we're going to   provide school choice very important and   put an end to common core so we can   bring our education local we will save   the Second Amendment which is under   siege the NRA endorsed Trump the NRA   endorses and we will appoint justices to   the United States Supreme Court who will   uphold and defend the Constitution of   the United States   Americans are tired of being told by   politicians that they have to defer   their dreams to another day but they   really mean defer their dreams to   another decade you know that and I know   that and they know that Hillary has been   there for 30 years and she's   accomplished nothing she's just made   things worse she's a candidate of   yesterday and we are the movement of the   future and speaking of the future here   is mr.

think of that I mean think of it one in   three jobs since NAFTA and China make   deals we made deals with China World   Trade Organization what a disaster that   was supported by Hillary Clinton but the   NAFTA deal signed by her husband   although we did a great thing two days   ago when he was willing to say how bad   Obamacare was I was great that was   pretty good   the open border policies and I just   wrote this out but I feel it so   important the open border policies of   Hillary Clinton including catch and   release another terrible practice have   allowed a massive influx of drugs into   New Hampshire and frankly in two states   all over our country almost every state   and its really fueled the tremendous   heroin and drug crisis that we have   we're going to close up those borders   folks believe me and I promise that to   you in New Hampshire more than anything   else I said and I talk about it no   matter where I go and I mentioned this   state because it was really the first   glimpse I got to have serious the   problem we have they're poisoning our   youth they're poisoning more than are   you they're poisoning everybody but   they're poisoning our youth stuff enough   out there our youth doesn't have a   chance with what's happening and we're   not going to let it happen anymore and   we're going to help the people that are   so badly addicted we're going to help   [Applause]   so I'm going to bring your jobs back   jobs are leaving like you never saw   before record levels i'm going to stop   the drugs from coming in i'm going to   create school choice and we're going to   get rid of common core which is a   disaster and we're going to create   something very special for every   disadvantaged child in this country of   which we have far too many we're going   to repeal and replace Obamacare which   bill admitted this week is a crazy   system can you believe hey least he's   honest boy has he suffered can you   imagine can you imagine that as he has   he suffered but he said it's a crazy   system that doesn't make sense and   doesn't work and where people end up   with premiums doubled and coverage cut   in half I couldn't have said it better   myself I've been saying it hey I've been   saying it for two years longer I know   I'm gonna put him on the campaign oh I'm   sure they do you think anybody's called   him and said let's recheck he did a   minor retraction but you could see he   wasn't happy about it remember Jonathan   Gruber do we remember the name I don't   ever forget Jonathan grow be the   architect of the bill admitted it was   sold on lies remember that sold he   thought he was talking to his friend   unfortunately his friend too turned out   not to be such a good friend because his   friend had a little cell phone going   those cell phones are brutal just like   emails are brutal unless you want to   delete them all   unless you delete about 33,000 but   Jonathan group of the architect of   Obamacare admitted was sold on lies and   talked about the stupidity of the   American voter right remember that the   stupidity of the American voter the only   stupidity was that the politicians who   ignored the American people and forced   this thing absolutely forced it down   their throat and Hillary Clinton wants   to double down she wants to make it even   worse I mean that's ultimately what's   going to happen in me you've seen what   we're going to do you can have much much   better health care at a much lower price   and people are going to be very happy   extremely happy and we're going to take   care of those that are disadvantaged it   can't afford to do what others can't   afford to do but you're going to be   spending and we're going to take care of   them better than they're being taken   care of now but you're going to have   health care that works you're going to   have health care where companies compete   to get your business and they'll come up   with plans that you haven't even seen or   thought about right now it'll be a   beautiful thing to see and I'm sure   we'll be talking about it on sunday   night during the debate because there's   no way we'll lose this issue it's a   disaster Obamacare is a disaster   we're going to create a more honest   government our government is a disaster   how about the 1.7 billion in cash that   was given to a rant cash remember was   going to be four hundred million turned   out to be one point seven billion in   case you know what that is that's more   than this room that's you would put it   probably in hundreds although is all   different currencies from different   nationalities maybe they didn't want   american dollars they said anybody so   stupid to make a deal like this we don't   want their money but can you imagine   this these people they never saw   anything like it and by the way that's   not going to fight terror they got   plenty of money that they use in a fight   that's going to this wis bank accounts   okay just in case you had any questions   all right anyway we gave it to them and   boy did we give it to them so i want to   let you know that we are going to be a   country that's going to be run properly   and i'm going to be by the time this   finishes i'll be in for tremendous   amounts of money tremendous amounts of   money that i fund myself we also have a   lot of wonderful people in terms of   small donations and that's coming in   fantastically and we have some people   that just feel very good about our   country under proper leadership but   we're spending a lot of money and we're   doing it ourselves and we're very proud   of it we're going to be very proud of   our country and what people call up to   ask for certain favors that are bad for   the country but good for them the nice   part i don't even have to take their   phone call I don't need them I don't   have to take this   before we go any further I want to send   our thoughts our hearts are with all of   the people and prayers to the millions   in the path of what's now known as   hurricane Matthew it looks like it's a   big one and it's going to be a bad one   it looks like hopefully it takes that   right turn but it looks like it's going   in the opposite direction not good   there's one of the strongest storms to   hit in many decades and our neighbors in   florida georgia and the carolinas are in   a direct path that seems southeast   florida has taken the brunt we have a   lot of friends in Florida a lot of a lot   of buildings a lot of investments in   Florida a lot of great employees in   florida southeast florida is taking the   brunt of the storm to all of my friends   in Florida please know that we are   praying for you and everyone in the path   you got to take care of yourself you've   got to get out of the area you've got to   listen you have a great governor   Governor Scott and you gotta listen   because it could be a it could be a   really really bad one so it's going to   be a rough couple of days and maybe   beyond that but we'll see what the path   ultimately is we've seen the damage   throughout the Caribbean and Cuba the   Bahamas Haiti and others in fact they   say in Haiti almost 270 people they   think around 270 people have already   been killed by this terrible stone so to   the folks in haiti and all over we're   going to be helping you will be with you   and we send our best wishes and prayers   we have a tremendous problem that i   think is brewing right now as we speak   here so we'll know in about four or five   hours i just spoke to rick scott and   Governor Christie just spoke to rick   Scott and it looks like four or five   hours away so we'll well no but whatever   happens we're with everybody because it   is it looks like it's going to be a very   bad when maybe the worst in a long   period of time okay with that Howie Carr   has been amazing he's been very I don't   know if he's allowed to support but he   sounds like he supports me a lot I'm not   sure that he's allowed to I'm not sure   he's allowed to but I think probably but   he certainly been amazing and he's very   talented guy he's a terrific guy with a   terrific family so when we came up and a   lot of people wanted us to do this we   said let's get Howie so hey let's go you   have some questions I do and I have a   clock it down on the floor there that   says two minutes okay now do you want me   to call you when it goes over two   minutes like I'll tell you what I'll   make a deal if I'm doing well don't call   me if I'm answering the question poorly   please call me immediately in fact you   could go okay you could go in 30 seconds   you could do it all right all right all   right all right thank God okay the first   question some of these are I have the   names and if I have the name I'll just   ask the person to stand up this is a   Matthew in bedford new hampshire matthew   is Matthew Matthew here hi Matthew hi   Matthew okay Matthew says after the   first debate the media and even some   within the party suggested that you   should have gone after Hillary more did   you hold back and do you plan on   criticizing her more this weekend yeah I   did hold back i thought it was just   inappropriate to say what I was really   thinking I would say and I held back i   think for I think for good reason I   think for good reason I'd much rather   have it be on policy and I didn't like   getting into the into the gutter and so   I did go back I also i mean honestly   this was you know the Commission the   so-called commission on presidential   debates give me a break did you see   where they came from one of them comes   from the Hillary camp the head person   how's your microphone work with this   microphone is wonderful but I had a   problem with a mic we had a guy inside   the room oscillating my mic was it that   the mic didn't work and you know it's   interesting i went there a little bit   before and I said boy that Mike is so   great unfortunately when I went to talk   they turn the mic up and down and you   saw it everybody in the room so on so we   had a real problem and the head of the   debate set your writer was a serious   problem told this to Mayor Giuliani it   was a serious problem after   the debate an hour and a half he said   and now that the debates over I'm going   back stage to find out what was wrong I   said oh great that help but I felt that   I really felt that I wanted to keep it   on as high a level as possible let's see   what happens I mean let's see what   happens I think we're all better off if   we can do that because it is about   issues it is about policies so you kept   it in a minute 20 good what do you see   is the biggest foreign policy failures   of the last 15 years oh well do we have   about what 24 hours to talk about this   look we've had failures at every level   we've had failures I think the Iran deal   is one of the worst deals I've ever seen   okay it's going to lead to nuclear   weapons i was with Bibi Netanyahu the   other day and we talked and we talked   about it and not to reveal what he said   but i will tell you i can tell you what   i said this is horrible for israel it's   horrible for our country it's a horrible   deal because over a period of time over   a short period of time it leads to   within ten years and it's going to be   sooner than that they gonna end up with   nuclear weapons and they have like a   path on top of it we gave them back 150   billion dollars we obviously paid ransom   for our hostages obviously you know   obama says this had nothing to do well   why did they delay it until all this   money came in but most importantly just   to pay a deal and i'm all for deals   because i happen to think that nuclear   is just about the biggest problem that   we have in the world today i think it's   one of you know Obama thinks its global   warming I think its nuclear and in the   hands of the wrong players this is   devastating there's no winner there's   never going to be a winner with nuclear   believe me and so I think deals look   fine but they have to be good deals the   deal made by secretary Kerry he never   left the table he just agreed agreed   agreed he'd want something that say no   and he'd agree so said but there's one   example of a just horrible horrible   thing we should have never gone into   Iraq should never gone into Iraq but of   equal importance or almost equal   importance is the way we got out Obama   took us out with Hillary Clinton create   this incredible   vacuum Isis was formed a lot of   different problems happened and totally   destabilized you know the surge whether   you were in favor of going in or not the   surge really did work then all of a   sudden boom not only that we announced   always we're leaving here we're leaving   then what how about Mosul did you see   Mosul where they announced yesterday I'm   seeing all about we're going to attack   Mosul we're going to attack muscle I   mean why do they say that now a lot of   the bad ombres are in muscle the leaders   of Isis they think but they're not there   anymore because they say hey wait a min   to attack let's go someplace else isn't   there an element of surprise remember   when we were young and we were studying   history and they talked about some of   the great generals and the great attacks   and was called the element of surprise   would it be nice if we attacked first   and talked about our great victory later   no you're not seriously who's gonna   it's almost like they're wasting their   time attacking Muslim because everyone   that we want is going to be gone you   have all civilians and there'll be   tremendous death and carnage but the   people that we want they're going to say   hey which are the leaders get the hell   out of here it's a very very sad thing   we are being run by people that are   incompetent I will tell you that there's   a Charlene from Sandberg then around she   here Charlene Charlene I know oh yeah   Charlene says mr. Trump I'm an eighth   generation American of Hispanic descent   I live in New Hampshire in California   you have my vote I want to help other   Hispanics see the truth that she talks   about how with the current   administration is the border security   sanctuary cities or increasing Drugs and   Crime she says Charlene says what would   you say to convince Hispanics who were   deceived by Barack Obama Hillary Clinton   and the biased media to vote for you   well first of all thank you very much   and I appreciate it interestingly i was   listening the other day there was a   gentleman who owns a big radio station   hispanic mostly all hispanic callers and   he was arguing with one of the house he   said no you don't us in the people that   are calling in hispanics they love Trump   they're all for Trump and he said I was   even surprised but now I'm for Trump   also you know I mean this is happening   more and more I just got back from Las   Vegas where we gave a tremendous I mean   we had a tremendous crowd of people a   lot of Hispanics Latinos they like to be   called in that area you know that right   Hispanics and Latinos but we had   tremendous response and just tremendous   was an outpouring of love amazing and   you know people that are here legally   they don't want people coming across the   border illegally taking their jobs   taking their homes taking whatever they   want to take and we want people to come   in now I want people to come into our   country so bad but they have to come in   Legally you know we have a country and   we have laws we have a border and if you   don't have a border you don't have a   country but I think the biggest surprise   to big surprises we're going to do great   with african-americans you look at   what's happening with the inner cities   it's a disgrace and the Democrats have   been running them for up to a hundred   years unbroke   and the African Americans believe me I   think we're doing and you see how that   the numbers are changing one thing they   don't have a lot of confidence in   Hillary Clinton she's lied to him for   years she never pushy doesn't produce   she does she just doesn't produce but I   think we're going to do great with the   African Americans you look at the   poverty in the inner cities you look at   the crime in the inner cities you look   at the education and there's no jobs and   we're going to do fantastic with the   Hispanics I believe it do it well   keeping it down right yeah Karen   Whittaker from San down here in San down   Karen hi Karen oh thank you thank you I   like this audience I like this audience   how do you define the income range for   middle class it cannot be based on where   you live because the US tax codes do not   discriminate based on geography well   look out the way I look at it the middle   class has been forgotten in this country   taxes are too high jobs have been taken   away from you are a lot of our companies   a lot of great companies have left our   country they've gone to Mexico and other   places China is making so much of our   product we don't make product anymore   anywhere near like we used to and i will   tell you such a great question because   our middle class has been treated so   badly by the politicians i mean it's   like forgotten and we're lowering taxes   as you know way down for the middle   class we're changing the tax structure   completely we had seven brackets now we   have three and we'll bring it down   actually for those making not a lot it's   zero and we don't want them to send in   because that's huge bureaucratically and   extremely costly but we're bringing the   rates down to numbers that are much   lower you've seen the numbers much lower   and you're going to have a much lower   tax base hillary clinton's raising your   taxes way up I don't even know what   she's thinking she's ready we're already   the highest tax nation in the world just   about they can maybe find every once in   a while there so they'll fact check me   well know there is a nation that you   never heard of where it's slightly   higher we are just about industrial of   the industrialized nations with the   highest tax payers in the world with the   highest   tax nation in the world our business   taxes are going to be brought from   thirty-five percent to fifteen percent   were cutting regulations which are   absolutely we want regulation for   environmental we want regulation for   safety but the regulations are massive   ally their massive and we're cutting the   regulations at a tremendous clip and i   would say seventy percent of the   regulations can go it's it's just   stopping businesses from growing and i   think you're going to see a tremendous   change in this country we're going to   see jobs come back we're going to see   companies come back into our country and   right now they're just leaving it's a   one-way street out we have a one-way   street right out of the country and   they're going largely to Mexico and   other places but Mexico is the eighth   wonder of the world I tell the story a   lot I have a friend who builds plants   and he builds these massive plants and   he says done it you have to see what's   going on in Mexico I said how about our   country he goes not so much we're going   to switch that around a little bit and   we'll get along great with Mexico by the   way but we've got to switch that around   it's been a one-way highway out of the   United States is kappa see in   londonderry here kappa c kappa i   recently graduated magna cum laude with   a BS in chemistry and i'm having a lot   of trouble finding a job what's your   plan to bring jobs back to America well   that's the biggest problem and that   takes place with so many and and even   though it's over a hundred degrees in   this room don't feel but you know this   room was not meant for this many people   you do know that I heard the other night   I was making a speech and we had   tremendous massive crowds and it was   really hot so I'm a little warm and   there might have been a little bit of   sweat and one of these dishonest people   said Donald Trump was sweating tonight   said sweat it was a hundred degrees   and guess what we're all sweating   tonight also right that's okay that's   good that's healthy the biggest problem   you have is people go to college I mean   that's great getting out magna that's   fantastic that means real smart but   people go to college they work they   borrow money they're up to here they're   up to their their neck and debt and then   they get out and they can't get a job I   mean it's such a massive problem they   can't get a job because are really good   jobs are gone and they've gone to other   countries and so many other countries   are making our product I want to see the   day when you could get those great marks   in that incredible profession which you   love probably or you wouldn't have been   so high up in the class right at the top   but I want to see the day when we can   have those jobs back in this country at   the highest level I want to see the day   when Apple will make their iPhones in   this country instead of making them in   China and Vietnam and all over the place   okay and believe me if I'm president   that's going to happen and I use Apple   as an example but in all fairness Apple   makes all its products all over the   place they're not making them here   mostly in China now Vietnam which is   becoming very strong for this thinking   to stop making them here they're going   to start making them here we have the   people we have the most unbelievable   people if I learned one thing and going   around cuz we started on june sixteenth   of last year and I've gotten to know the   people and we have by far the biggest   rallies that people have seen far bigger   than Bernie and he was second but far   bigger now Bernie's aren't so big by the   way they're very small Bernie made a big   mistake by the way Bernie Bernie Sanders   would have been legendary if he didn't   make a deal with the devil when he made   that deal his stock went way down it   went way down I mean honestly even as   somebody that is you know disagrees with   him on a lot of things other than trade   we agree very much on trade very very   much entre except I'll do things about   it because I like free trade but I want   to make great deal free trade but he was   right on trade because our country is   being ripped off or jobs on everything   but we're going to have a country that   makes product again we're going to have   a country that Apple and these other   great companies are going to make their   product in our country and we're gonna   have lots of people working including   yourself we have to do that okay thank   you is Bob Swanson here Bob Swanson hi   Bob it's one of my favorite questions   when you become president and you can   you assure the American people that   you're going to clean house from the top   at the FBI Justice Department State   Department and the VA and in what order   would you start well I guess we'll be   talking about this for a while to come   but I have to tell you it's one of the   saddest things I've ever seen happen to   our country what's happened with Hillary   Clinton where you send emails where they   send a subpoena and they want all of   your emails I mean if you're in private   business and you do what she did it's   called the whose girl okay they the   United States Congress Congress sends a   subpoena wanting emails and she gets to   subpoena and she deletes 33,000 EMS   ended many other things including lying   all over the place and you see people   who have suffered greatly including   General Petraeus for doing a tiny   fraction of what she did that's only   because well we're not gonna we can't   stay here all night and talk about but   the lie she told to Congress the lie she   told to the people but the lie she told   to Congress and then you see an FBI give   her a know tape know anything no   swearing in I believe they said no   swearing you don't do even swear in and   they questioned her on the fourth of   July and then they released their   finding on Labor Day on right before   Labor Day when everyone's gone and gone   two gone here they got in there I think   what's happened with respect to because   I have such respect for the people in   the FBI and I have such incredible   respect for the FBI what's happened to   the FBI and two   justice department at the highest level   honestly I think it's one of the saddest   things I've ever seen in this country it   whether we like it or don't like it to   look at what's happened and to look at   the way that's been handled and you know   every time I speak this is mentioned the   subject of the people are going crazy   the people of this country are very very   angry very very angry and i would think   I don't know this but i would think that   some of these great FBI agents and the   people that work within the FBI i would   imagine they are just furious it's   what's happened to the reputation of the   FBI so I mean I think it's an amazing   question honestly it's like we're a   third world country it's one of the   saddest things that I've ever seen   happen in this country and it happened   to justice and that's probably I guess   the way you feel also right yeah it's   very sad we also quick follow-up what   would you do with call me I just am very   disappointed I mean you you know when he   read the charges and he's going 1 2 3 4   and I'm saying wow they're going to do   the right thing and and he goes   essentially however it was I mean it was   amazing it was amazing to go after point   after point and that was only a few of   them so it's very disappointing it's   very disappointing Sharon Osbourne from   Auburn Sharon   Sharon for the conservative holdouts mr.   Trump who are not on the Trump bandwagon   yet what can you say to convince them   that your support for traditional   conservative issues of free markets the   Bill of Rights and the rest of the   Constitution mean they should endorse   you well you know we don't have too many   Howie I'll be honest with you you know   the press likes to report you have some   of these long-term people that have done   such a bad job you look at the look at   the problem our country's in I would   never use these people and they know   that so then they announce in a group   that they're going over to Hillary right   you understand and they announce in a   group but you know we have tremendous   support including a couple of your very   distinguished folks from New Hampshire   who were against me who are now for me   and you're allowed to announce the names   but we have tremendous support in New   Hampshire one of them was very tough and   very smart go ahead John Sununu let's   show I'd watch him and say boy this is   tough his son is four points up god   that's good well that's good because I'm   a I mean I I thought it was terrific I   met him the other day and father and son   and I think I think they're great people   but he was tough I'll tell you what he   was he was really hunting for Trump and   you know what I respect somebody that   can go the other way it's not that easy   a pivot as you would say but I very much   appreciate the Sununu family and the   fact that they are with me and I am with   them and they going to do very well he's   going to do very well and I see the   numbers and and you know one of the   things that have really happened they   all thought ohh truck because look I've   never done this and but I've done very   well in my life and business and done a   lot of good things and but I've never   done this so all of the reports well   you'll take down the senator and he'll   take down this center do you know how   well the Republicans are doing I guess   there's a gentleman in Illinois that's   not doing so well this guy was actually   taking out ads against me I said are you   sure he's a Republican maybe he's a   Democrat and he's not doing well but hey   that's his problem I mean you know he   was not for me but if you look at and he   was there was for political reasons but   if you look at what   going on now they're all talking about   fact the other day I saw very   interesting one of the announcement you   know Donald Trump is having a very   positive effect on these races the   Republicans are going to hold their   doing terrific Lee well far better than   anyone thought and frankly we are   winning states and we're going to win   some states that would never in a   million years you know this being play I   mean we have some states like we're   doing great in Colorado somebody else   wouldn't do well nobody else would do   well we're doing great i think well   bleeding colorado one of the polls as   you know just came out we're leading   colorado i just left we're leading a lot   of places and or doing at least very   competitively in a lot of states that   absolutely would not be four republicans   and you know one of the the funny things   they do the maps and remember two months   ago i'd watch two different people that   do the maps and a very small pet it's   tougher for the republicans i have to   tell you but they said there's a very   small path but i was watching the other   day and the same person was single wow   this path is getting a lot wider doesn't   mean they were happy about it but the   path now there's four different paths   before was there was one little one   bates overall nate silver's been you   know he didn't predict us in the primary   and he had never called a loser before I   mean you know he's always been on the   right side of of what happened in terms   of at least his predictions and he   didn't predict me in the primaries and   in all fairness you know never seen me   never spoke to me never saw what we did   you know we had 17 very talented people   and one by one by one it was a beautiful   sight to watch wasn't it beautiful being   pink and by the way how those people   most of them endorsed me ben Carson   chris Christie so many of them endorsed   me and they're great endorsements Scott   Walker has been incredible no pets he   helped ents to Mike Pence by the way has   been fantastic and he did a great job   last night   is good at it a great he did a great job   dressing that brings me to another   question from Louis from Brent wedding   Louis Thank You Louis did you really say   Louis asked you were you upset about mr.   Pence's debate success as John Harwood   said John Harwood was the worst   moderator out of all the debates we had   how many did we have 11 or 12 he was so   bad this guy knows nothing about me I   was so happy and I saw today that   somebody on CNN the Clinton news network   who knows nothing about us you know they   use John King actually he's a nice guy   like him on the maps he does a good job   with the maps I like him better now than   I did a couple of months ago cuz a   couple of months ago I had no chance now   all of a sudden that map is getting very   red but John King said you know they   always have a source they always ever   source a source with and nobody talks to   him nobody stopped because he's like the   enemy he's like the enemy but he said   and a few other people said Donald Trump   was at first happy and then he was   unhappy because Mike Pence did so well I   said unhappy with jumping up and down he   was so good and I'll tell you what he's   a great human being he's a you can't do   it against him you can't but I was   telling chris i was telling Chris Chris   I said can you imagine these people are   saying that I would have loved to have   you know seen them not too well because   that makes me look better these people   that's why a guy like John King has   stayed in the same position for like how   long has he been at CNN hey I used to   say I think someday he'll be an anchor   guess what he's still doing the maps but   but no I was so happy and I i mean i can   i can give you my word of this i was so   happy that Mike did well and I was   rooting him on and we were talking all   during the day and I was giving us some   ideas and we're running things by each   other and it's so disconcerting when you   hear even tonight they said Donald Trump   is going to New Hampshire to practice   for sunday this has nothing to do with   sunday and it's like they make you into   like a child and this as I   of the people of New Hampshire if this   was set up a little while ago they were   going to cancel it and I said why you   gonna cancel it well you wanted to bake   purpose and forget the bay prep I mean   give me a break do you really think that   Hillary Clinton is debate prepping for   three or four days Hillary Clinton is   resting okay she's resting she wants to   build up her energy for Sunday night and   you know what that's fine but uh the the   narrative is so foolish I'm here for one   reason i love the people of New   Hampshire I said I was going to be here   and I'm here very simple this one this   one is unsigned but it's a good question   what that's trouble would you give to   young Americans looking to achieve the   American Dream always go into what you   love doing and you may have parents that   are trying to push you one way or   another but you know what you love you   have to do what you love and I say this   all the time I say it in speeches and   everything I mean I'll speak in front of   young people because I love doing it and   I say always follow your dream always go   into what you love and never ever quit   or give up I've seen a lot of people   over the years big people not so big   usually it's not so big because if they   quit they're not going to get so big but   the most successful people I've ever met   are the people that never quit they   never give up they just don't take no   for an answer so do something that you   really love doing because then it's not   work and never ever quit or give up all   right do one or two more thank you I   think you I think you've dealt with this   one before it's from ALB all the sorrow   over there hello al al say yeah yeah pal   now wants to know what you're gonna   [Applause]   al wants to know what you're going to do   about the VA how are you going to make   it possible the veterans as al can tell   you and as a lot of the veterans in this   room because I recognize some of you and   and I've become very close to the vets   and a lot of it started with New   Hampshire to be honest in Iowa but I   really got close to the vets and I'll   tell you what in many cases they're   living in hell what's going on with the   Veterans Administration between the   corruption the long long waits 22   suicides today I thought that was a typo   when I heard 22 suicides a day said   that's impossible 22 suicides a day much   of it caused by the fact that they can't   get to see doctors Howie they wait in   line four five and six days and at the   end of the sixth day the doctor says   sorry you know I'm going on vacation and   actually the Veterans Administration and   the vets tell me this they have some   really great doctors but getting to see   them is sometimes almost impossible we   are going to solve finally the problem   of the Veterans Administration we have   illegal immigrants that in many cases   are treated better than our great   veterans and you know that and everybody   knows that they're being treated better   than our veterans and that's not going   to happen one of the things we're going   to do is the lines are impossible   getting to see a doctor is in many cases   just days and days when that   circumstance happens we're going to let   our veterans go across the street around   the corner two miles away and see a   doctor private or a hospital public or   private where they're looking for work   where they have wonderful people and   they're looking for work take care of   their problem and we will pay the bill   and that's going to be the cheapest   thing we can do it's going to be the   cheapest thing we can do and   and Al can tell you and a lot of the   vets that I recognized in the room they   can tell you everybody's in love with   the plan and we're going to keep the   Viet but we're gonna we're going to keep   the Veterans Administration we're going   to keep the hospital's we're going to   keep the building because I think that's   important you know we have to take care   of our vets these are people that we   wouldn't be here if it weren't for the   vets but but when they're waiting in   line for and they know it's there's no   end in sight and honestly they're dying   they need a simple procedure they need a   prescription they need something very   easy and they end up dying and it's a   very sad thing so they're going to be   able to go across the street to a public   private hospital to a doctor and we're   going to take care of our vets for the   first time we're really going to take   care of our vets okay this peak from   Nashua near nashua Pete from Nashua says   Hillary Clinton wants to give Social   Security and Medicare to illegal   immigrants through citizenship won't   this bankrupt the programs well let me   tell you you've heard that and most   people didn't even believe it but that's   true and you know she's open border she   wants people to just flow through a look   when the border patrol agents 16,500 and   when ice when they come out and they've   never endorsed a presidential candidate   before but these are great people that   want to do their jobs you know it's much   harder for them to do their job said to   just stand back right now it's stand   back let them in it's much and catch and   release which is a disaster but when   they want to do their jobs and it's much   more difficult and they come out and   endorse Trump who's going to have them   do their jobs and we're going to build a   wall and we'll to stop things from   coming and look wigga to stop and this   was the Pledge I made to New Hampshire   more than any other place because this   is where I really couldn't believe it   but I said if I win and if I become   president first get the nomination that   happened become president I promised the   people of New Hampshire that we are   going to stop this crap from coming into   your steak one hundred percent   one hundred percent and it can be done   and it can be done even before the wall   goes up the wall is a necessary edge of   you know I asked the patrol I asked   really the ice folks that endorse me and   I asked the Border Patrol folks that   address they said how important is the   wall and you know I'm so committed to   the wall I was pretty sure they were   going to say this but I wasn't a hundred   percent they said mr. Trump it is   absolutely necessary for us to do our   proper job which made me you know gave   me a little additional security as far   as the wall is concerned we need the   wall we have to stop the drugs heroin   but many drugs but we have to stop the   drugs from pouring into our country and   believe me it is poisoning our country   and it's poisoning are you our youth and   we're going to stop it and we're going   to stop it fast long before the wall   gets up we're gonna start there well   fast I get them built fast but I'll tell   you long before we're going to stop that   poison from flowing into our country   okay one more will do another question   I'm gonna ask you I'm gonna ask you why   the kind of question Hillary Clinton   gets sometimes I mean easy here right   she gets easy ones that's what I mean   you ever noticed by the way did you see   the difference I'm getting boom boom   boom with her what would you do to fix   the economy of course that's actually a   much tougher question than you would   understand but and she doesn't have a   clue but you see the questions i was   getting lara from Hampton New Hampshire   are you here that's Laura ok let's have   a fun question what is one of your   earliest memories as a child and why do   you think it stands out and then she   says go Donald thank you thank you I   think just the relationship I had with   my parents you know my father built   houses in brooklyn and queens and   departments and he was a very good   negotiator I'd sit at his knee and it   wasn't that he taught me he didn't   really say son you have to learn but   he'd be on the telephone negotiating   with a plumber or an electrician or a   sheet rocker and I would hear this and I   playing with blocks at his knee on the   floor and I'd be listening and just it   was always so vivid and he was always   negotiating and you know what that's   what we need in this country because   people are running away with our country   you look at what's going on whether it's   the border whether it's are depleted   military the greatest people on earth   are military people but they have old   equipment you saw the piece they did on   many of the networks where they show   fighter jets where they're 18 years old   they're so old that they don't make the   parts of him with these are fighter jets   that our people are flying now and they   have to go into plain graveyards they   have to go into graveyards to get parts   and they have to go into museums to get   parts because they don't make the parts   anymore now we need a strong military we   need to protect our Second Amendment we   need to take care of our vets we need   borders we need great education getting   rid of common core so important we need   so many things and by the way one thing   and I know John Sununu and a lot of   other people felt this was so important   when they came out so strongly United   States Supreme Court we need we lost a   great justice justice scalia great   justice we need great justices who are   going to uphold our Constitution and if   Hillary Clinton gets in you're going to   have a much different country so so many   people feel that's so important I   personally feel it's one of the most   important things defense always being we   have to defend our country and we have   to stop people coming in from parts of   the world where they're looking to do us   harm believe me and they're pouring in   and Hillary Clinton wants to have them   come in at a rate of five hundred and   fifty percent more than President Obama   we are going to stop it and you know the   statement we are going to make America   great again and it's going to happen   quickly so thank you very much everybody   thank you I got one more question for   you Donald I'm going to let you read it   and remember where you are tonight as   you answer this question oh the World   Series oh look now of course it's busted   Thank You Donald Trump new hampshire   round of applause Donald J Trump the   next president of the United States   Thank You Donald Trump   [Applause]   good luck to Florida good luck in   wisconsin tomorrow and good luck in st.

go out there and work hard you   need the leadership to come from the   very pinnacle from the very top and if   it doesn't it's not going to happen and   that's not happening   thank you ladies and gentlemen that's a   great honor boy what a crowd we've been   all over today North Carolina and   Pennsylvania we have had crowds you   wouldn't believe it congressman Duncan   from Tennessee said the greatest thing   he's ever seen he's never seen anything   like this and I'll tell you what it's   really been it's really been a great   honor and in 18 days we are going to win   the state of Pennsylvania and we are   going to win the White House but you   have to get out november eight you have   to get out just have to get out and vote   otherwise we've all wasted a lot of time   and energy I've wasted time energy and   money so you got to get out we got to   turn this thing around what's going on   in our country today is a disgrace our   opponents have spent more money than   ever before in the history of campaigns   raised from special interests and yet   we're leading in polls from Rasmussen to   the LA Times to investor's business   daily leading nationwide leading just   came out just came out with leading   nationwide together we're going to   deliver real change that puts America   first we're going to renegotiate our   terrible absolutely terrible horrible   trade deals and illegal immigration stop   the massive inflow of refugees reduce   surging crime cut taxes big league cut   regulations big Lee   and Common Core bring our education   local and repeal and replace Obamacare   disaster your premiums are going up   seventy eighty ninety percent and it's   only going to get worse and Hillary   Clinton wants to do it more so we're   going to repeal it we're going to   replace it with something much better at   a fraction of the cost your jobs will   come back under a trump administration   your incomes will go up under a trump   administration your taxes will go way   down under a trump administration   your companies won't be leaving   Pennsylvania under a trump   administration that I can tell you there   will be consequences we're also going to   rebuild our badly depleted military have   the greatest people on earth but if   they've let it go our Navy is the   smallest it's been since World War One   my plan will be to build 350 ships we   need a 350 ship Navy much lower than   that right now smallest since world war   one can you believe that this will be   the largest effort at rebuilding our   military since Ronald Reagan and it will   require a truly national effort and do   we need that or what the Philadelphia   Navy Yard is a perfect example I went to   school in Philadelphia I know   Philadelphia very well I will instruct   my secretary of the Navy to study   locations like Philadelphia with a long   history of service to our military and   proximity to vibrant private industry   and find ways to involve them in this   national effort it'll happen as our   fleet is rebuilt we'll need to invest in   recruiting the skilled American   craftsmen that we need like welders and   pipefitters and so many more people that   don't have jobs greatest people will   establish centers of excellence in   places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth   New Hampshire   and hampton roads virginia to produce   the master craftsman we need to rebuild   our fleet and many other things we will   rebuild our navy and we will do it with   american steel made right here in   pennsylvania and you see what's happened   to our steel industry bum   as part of our plan for bold change to   make your life better we will also   rebuild our massively depleted   infrastructure our roads our bridges or   tunnels it's all falling apart we have   20 trillion dollars in debt and our   roads and infrastructure are a disaster   Obama Clinton double the national debt   in eight years but instead of rebuilding   America the money was all lost and   America's infrastructure is like that of   a third-world country we spent six   trillion dollars in the Middle East and   it's in far worse shape now than it was   15 years ago think of it spent six   trillion does we could have rebuilt our   country two times over imagine if we had   spent this money rebuilding the inner   cities of Philadelphia instead we spent   trillions on foreign countries and left   our towns and cities to crumble how   smart are our politicians these are   stupid people stupid people   we defend other country's borders invest   in their resources but abandoned their   own think of it we fight for other   countries borders and yet our border is   like a sieve like water pours through   when I have strong borders we're going   to have the wall don't worry about the   wall we're gonna have the wall that I   can   we will build the wall and who's going   to pay for the wall right they may not   know it yet they're paying for the world   and I met with the President of Mexico   nice guy two months ago and we had a   good meeting just the beginning but we   had a very good meeting believe me and   it's very unfair we have a highway that   goes right into Mexico they're taking   our plants they're taking our jobs are   taken so much we've lost so much look at   Philadelphia look at Pennsylvania look   at what's happened to Pennsylvania the   jobs look at the steel industry in   Pennsylvania was the greatest in the   world and now it's not so good it's   going to be good again it's going to be   great again not good it's going to be   great again the plan on proposing   targets substantial new investment here   at home to fix America's transportation   drinking water and other vital   infrastructure this can be achieved   through a focus on public-private   partnerships proven financing programs   and tax credits that incentivize   companies to make major job and wealth   producing investments in your local   economies should be done this means help   for projects like the Pennsylvania   Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania   portion of the appalachian highway   system needs help needs help not in good   shape amazing what it looks like now   compared to 10 or 15 years ago isn't it   look at your whole lives compared to 10   or 15 years ago my plan will also help   Pennsylvania upgrade replace bridges and   the Commonwealth that have been deemed   structurally deficient it's amazing what   percentage are structurally deficient I   said before sometimes you just want to   swim and just relax and swim across the   river get there safely not some of very   very dangerous we're also going to   unleash thank you I love you too   he sounds like a rough guy but I love   him in my own way I love him we're also   going to unleash the power of American   energy right here in Pennsylvania shale   oil natural gas and clean coal clean   coal we're going to put our miners back   to work folks and we're putting   Pennsylvania back to work and we're   going to put the special interests and   who knows more about special interests   than me but we're going to put them out   of work we're going to renegotiate NAFTA   stop the TPP which is a disaster and to   end up to foreign product dumping and   currency manipulation that make it   impossible for your companies to compete   your city has lost one third of its   manufacturing jobs since bill clinton   signed nafta a deal strongly supported   by hillary clinton listening to this   number and I've been saying it's a typo   70,000 not 7,000 or 700 or seven seventy   thousand factories have shut down or   left the United States since China   entered the World Trade Organization   I was another Clinton mez and a hundred   thousand jobs have been lost since she   produced the deal the great deal with   South Korea just a few miles from here   there's a very famous bridge that says   Trenton makes the world thanks   under a trump administration I can   promise you we are going to start making   things in America again we are going to   start making things in Pennsylvania   again your products will be sent around   the world not your jobs right now your   jobs are dissipated we're going to start   making things again do you remember it   used to say made in the USA or made in   America where do you see that anymore   you don't see it Hillary is controlled   by special interests who want to ship   your jobs to other countries she's the   most corrupt person ever to run for the   presidency of the United States   cheap bleach and deleted 33,000 emails   after getting a congressional subpoena   lied under oath to Congress lied to the   FBI obstructed justice made 13 iPhones   disappear some with a hammer and now we   just learned that two boxes of evidence   are mysteriously missing   and we just had a four-star general   highly respected general Cartwright you   heard what happened yesterday could go   to jail for five years because he   supposedly told a lie to the FBI what   one and I don't know that it was even a   lie I don't know that her general   Cartman is a four-star general this   happened yesterday could go to jail for   five years and there have been nothing   but lies to the FBI now from WikiLeaks   we've just learned he tried to get 12   million dollars from the King of Morocco   for an appearance one appears more pay   for play   that's why I'm proposing a package of   ethics reforms to make our government   honest once again it's time to drain the   swamp in Washington DC   [Applause]   is there anyplace more fun to be that a   trump rally right one new proposal I'm   outlining today will help us put the   corrupt regulation industry out of   business they are killing you steal   their killing your energy they're really   really hurting our country and we need   regulation we need regulation for safety   and we need regulation for the   environment but we don't need what's   happening with the regulation industry   that i can tell you i will work with   Congress to require that for everyone   new regulation to old regulations must   be eliminated we're losing two trillion   dollars in economic activity a year to   regulations the only people getting rich   are the lobbyists the lawyers and the   special interest I'm also going to push   for a constitutional amendment to impose   term limits on all of our members of   Congress time not only will we end   government can work well and you think   it's time right not only will we end   government corruption but will end   economic stagnation my plan lowers our   business tax from thirty five percent to   fifteen percent and lowers taxes for   everybody straight across the board   everybody as individuals and simplifies   our tax code   we're also going to rebuild our inner   cities african-americans and Hispanics   living in the inner cities are suffering   the violence is unbelievable and   unbearable you walk to the store with   your child and you get shot there's no   education there are no jobs there's no   safety nearly 3,500 people have been   shot in Chicago since January first the   beginning of the year homicides are up   nearly fifty percent in Washington DC   and more than sixty percent in Baltimore   and it's getting worse murder in the   United States is up more think of it is   up more than at any time over 45 years   the highest level in 45 years you don't   hear that from these dishonest people   back there meaning the media look at   them   most dishonest paper   they are the most dishonest people   they are dishonest people   [Applause]   we're living in a rigged system and   believe me they're a big part of the   rigging those people believe me they   don't tell the truth   so do the african-american and Hispanic   voters suffering in inner cities and   other places that are so riddled with   crime with no jobs with no education or   very poor education I say what do you   have to lose I will fix the inner cities   I will fix education we will bring back   jobs we will make the inner city safe   some of the inner cities are as   dangerous as the war zones you read   about in the Middle East we will do a   great job we will also make our nation   rich again we have to do that we have to   do it but to be a rich country we must   also be a safe country national security   begins at the border speaking in secret   to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said   her dream is for totally open trade and   open borders and she denied it   and she denied it the other night in the   debate right but she turned out to be   wrong she took who won the debate that   one I'm honestly that was not closed   except for a couple of dishonest groups   they would say oh I think she won I   think should give me a break Hillary's   plan includes an open border with the   Middle East meaning generations of   radicalism and terrorism spreading and   growing within our shores not good she   even wants a five hundred and fifty   percent increase in Syrian refugees over   Obama's numbers to come pouring into our   country she wants 500 think of it five   hundred and fifty percent more than the   thousands that are already coming in the   great white horse you watched folks it's   a great white horse so let me state very   clearly the fact that if I'm elected   president I am going to keep radical   Islamic terrorism the hell out of our   country   we will also stop the crisis of illegal   immigration

workers for their dedication and loyalty   over many years but especially for their   continued focus and dedication during a   very difficult year here in Indianapolis   over the past couple of weeks we've had   productive discussions with   president-elect Trump and vice   president-elect pence about their plans   to improve the competitiveness of the US   business environment through tax reform   and through a more thoughtful approach   to regulation those plans have given us   a renewed confidence in the future of   manufacturing here in the United States   it's why today we can talk about 1,100   jobs in Indiana going forward so I'm   pleased to announce that we would have   decided to keep carrier Indianapolis the   plant will remain open and continuing   manufacturing operations here we'll also   designate this facility as a center of   excellence for gas furnace production   when we the best more than 16 million   dollars over the next two years to   ensure that this it remains a   world-class manufacturing facility with   the ability to compete globally thank   you again for your hard work and   dedication to the entire carrier team   and we look forward to this facility   continuing to deliver industry-leading   products to our customers across North   America with that it's my pleasure to   introduce Vice president-elect Mike   Pence   united technologies it is great to have   him in the Hoosier State to the   executives at United Technologies who   are with us the executives with carrier   to the great carrier team here in   Indiana to our honored guests   governor-elect Eric Holcomb Indiana   Speaker of the House Brian Bosma   Indianapolis Mayor Joe hogs it my fellow   Hoosiers it is great to be back home   again in indiana and this is a great day   for Indiana and it's a great day for   working people all across the United   States of America the state of Indiana   is very proud we're proud manufacturing   state we're home to low taxes sensible   regulations great schools and roads and   the best workforce in America since the   1950s carrier has been a part of   Indiana's manufacturing success story   and we've been proud of it as governor I   couldn't be more pleased and grateful   that thanks to the initiative and the   leadership of President Elect Donald   Trump the carrier has decided to stay   and grow right here in America   [Applause]   we're so grateful we're so grateful that   thanks to the the initiative of our   president-elect that I'll talk about in   a minute and frankly thanks to the   confidence of Greg Hayes united   technologies in Bob McDonough it carrier   the carrier has decided to stay in   Indiana invest more than 16 million   dollars in this facility alone and will   keep more than 1,000 jobs right here in   the heart of the Heartland what a   difference a year makes you know the   truth be told job announcements are   almost a daily thing here in the state   of Indiana we're at record employment   today we have more Hoosiers going to   work than ever before that's why frankly   along with all of you who work in this   facility that that day februari tenth   was a heartbreaking day when carrier   made the difficult decision to close   this facility and move jobs out of our   country we met with the leaders of the   company back in March and try as we   might to make the Indiana case it was   clear that the die was cast the simple   truth was that policies coming out of   our nation's capital we're literally   driving jobs out of this country what   was missing was clear to me as your   governor what was missing was leadership   and change well the American people   voted for change last month and even   before taking office our president-elect   provided real leadership that made the   difference   [Applause]   you know president-elect Donald Trump   did just what he said he would do he   picked up the phone I was actually in   the room he picked up the phone he   talked from one American to another he   talked about our plans our plans to make   America more competitive to reduce taxes   to roll back regulations to put American   jobs and American workers first again he   made the case for America and carrier   decided to bet on a brighter future for   the American people and we are grateful   from the bottom of our hearts I'm very   humbled to be standing before you today   I truly am my family and I are deeply   moved by the opportunities of people of   Indiana have given us and now the   American people have given us to serve   but I'm especially humbled as the   holidays approach to have played some   small role in this wonderful news not   only here in Indiana but all across this   country but I think it's important to   give credit where credit is due first   and foremost I want to thing I want to   thank Greg Hayes and his team at United   Technologies Bob McDonald and the team   at carrier thank you for renewing your   commitment to Indiana and renewing your   commitment to the people of the United   States of America   I also just want to thank the great   carrier team here in Indianapolis and in   the state of Indiana your hard work your   resilience your work ethic even in   disappointing times I know for a fact   gave this company the confidence to   double down on the future of this   company and the future of the people of   this state and so I thank you the   carrier team for giving them the   confidence to do just that but lastly on   behalf of all the people of Indiana   allow me to allow me to thank the man we   wouldn't be here without for his efforts   for picking up the phone for keeping his   word his efforts to bring us to this day   of renewed hope and promise not just   here in Indiana but really for four   people that know that the strength of   this country comes in our ability to   make things in to grow things it's a   renewed day for manufacturing in America   you know I remember when when Donald   Trump was running for president he said   that if he was elected president in the   United States America would start   winning again well today America one and   we have Donald Trump to thank   and I got a feeling working beside this   extraordinary man this is just the   beginning of a lot more good news all   across America so without any further   ado my fellow Hoosiers it is my high   honor and distinct privilege to   introduce to you a man of action a man   of his word and the president-elect of   the United States of America Donald   Trump   you thank you everybody   thank you very much i love that red   I want to thank all of the dignitaries   that are with us today we have a whole   host the mayor and governor elect great   people it's a big victory for the   governor-elect you want very   convincingly so we're very proud of him   and you know mike has been such a wise   decision for me when people were saying   I don't know how good is he a decision   making that always say yeah but he   picked Mike Pence that's a good decision   and everybody loves Mike he's become   something very special I want to thank   Greg haze of united technologies because   when I when I called him he was right   there I wish I could have made the call   when they were doing their original   decision but it worked out just as well   other than I would have liked to have   had an answer a year a year and a half   ago we had a tremendous love affair with   the state of Indiana because if you   remember during the primaries this was   going to be the firewall this was where   they were going to stop Trump right and   that didn't work out too well and it was   a firewall for me it was a firewall and   we won by 16 points and the election   with just won by 20 points almost 20   points and I was some at was some   victory that's pretty it's pretty great   and I just love the people credible   people so I got involved because of the   love affair I've had this has been a   very special state to us and I'll never   forget about a week ago is watching the   nightly news I won't say which one said   I want to give him credit because I   don't like them much I'll be honest   I don't like him not even a little bit   but they were doing the story in carrier   and I say wow that's something I want to   see that and they had a gentleman worker   great guy handsome guy he was on and it   was like he didn't even know they were   leaving he said something to the effect   no we're not leaving because Donald   Trump promised us that we're not leaving   and I never thought I made that promise   not with carrier I made it for everybody   else I didn't make it really for carrier   and I said what's he saying and he was   such a believer he was such a great guy   he said I've been with Donald Trump from   the beginning and he made the statement   the kerry is not going anywhere they're   not leaving and I'm saying to myself man   and then they played my statement and I   said keria will never leave but that was   a euphemism I was talking about keria   like all other companies from here on in   because they made the decision a year   and a half ago but he believed that that   was that I could understand it I   actually said I didn't make it when they   played it I said I did make it but I   didn't mean it quite that way so now   because of him whoever that guy was is   he in the room by any chance that's your   son stand up you did a good job you   judge a great job right that's fantastic   that and I love you sure oh wow 00 put   it on cameras go ahead put it up well   your son is great and he and he meant   that didn't he he really meant it at   first I said I wonder if he's being   sarcastic because this ship has sailed   and I said it was 630 in the evening and   I said boy the first thing I'm going to   do is go there now I say do I call the   head of dairy or who's a great guy but   I've always learned I gotta call the top   and I heard about Greg Hayes he's a   great executive you know I don't know if   you know   united technologies is one of the top 50   companies in the United States and one   of the top companies anywhere in the   world they make many other things other   than air conditioners believe me their   list of companies is incredible so I   called Greg Hayes I heard of them but i   never have met him and he pick up the   phone mr. president-elect sir how were   you it's wonderful to win you know that   think of I lost he wouldn't have   returned my call I don't know if we're   is correct I don't know would you reach   if I lost and called you I don't think   you would have called I would have tried   for you guy but I think it would have   been tougher right what do you think I   guess sort of nodding yes you're right   but I called Greg and I said it's really   important we have to do something   because you have a lot of people leaving   and you have to understand we can't   allow this to happen anymore with our   country so many jobs are leaving and   going to other countries not just Mexico   many many countries and China is making   so much of our product that we're   closing up a lot of plants and I mean I   wrote down some numbers that are   incredible but the numbers of   manufacturing jobs that are lost   especially in the Rust Belt and the Rust   Belt is so incredible but we're losing   companies it's it's unbelievable one   after another just one after another so   I said Greg you gotta help us out here   we got to sit down we got to do   something I said because we just can't   let it happen anyway he was incredible   and he said I understand and I said I   wish I made this call a year and a half   ago would have been a lot easier call   only because your son okay believe me   your son whoever the hell your son is   these people owe him a lot and I just   went through he's out in the factory I   thought they were all going to be in   this room this room is not big enough   yeah I know I don't know who arranged   that one because I have we just visited   a thousand people in the factory that   are going wild in the plant but i will   tell you that united technologies and   carrier stepped it up and now they're   keeping actually the numbers over 1,100   people which is so great what   soper and and I see the people I shook   hands with a lot of the people the right   behind us working I guess what is it   you're so you're making so many air   conditioners you didn't want to even   have them come off for a half hour he's   a ruthless boss he's ruthless but that's   okay you know I did say one thing to the   carrier folks into the United   Technologies folks I said the goodwill   that you have engendered by doing this   all over the world frankly but within   our country you watch how fast you're   going to make it up because so many   people are going to be buying carrier   air conditioners you know we've had such   help here Bobby Knight nobody in India I   never heard of Bobby net how great is   popping I Lou Holtz gene Keady we had   such incredible support but I'll never   forget a friend of mine called up and   said during the primaries he said you   know if you could get coach night and I   said you know coach and I called me a   year ago this is a year before I decided   to run he said if you ever run I'm   supporting you I said thanks coach I   just don't know if I'm going to be doing   it and then when he said if you could   get coach night I'd say I got coach   night how good was Bobby Knight as far   as we're concerned in Indiana is that   right we got Bobby Knight 900 wins two   championships right two or three   championships Olympic gold medal pan am   games but and he was unbelievable he   wouldn't stop he was just going all over   he was the greatest guy we came into an   arena Greg and we had 16,000 people   inside outside we had I think ten   thousand outside it was and I left this   was three weeks before the primer and I   left I said how are we going to lose   Indiana with us I didn't think we were   going to lose and we didn't we won big   butt so I want to thank all of those   folks because they're really helped with   Indiana and with a lot of other places   so united technologies has stepped up   and I have to say this they did it in   such a nice in such a professional way   and they're going to spend so much money   on renovating this plant and I said Greg   say that number you know he said 16   million well the minimum   number 16 it's going to be in my opinion   a lot more than that he said well I'd   rather say the lower number see I'd   rather have them say the higher number   so I won't say okay it's just a   difference in philosophy do you agree   both are ok but difference in philosophy   but they're going to spend more than 16   they can spend a lot of money on the   plant and it said to some of the folks I   said companies are not going to leave   the United States anymore without   consequences not going to happen it's   not going to happen tell you right now   we're losing our that we're losing so   much so one of the things we're doing to   keep them is we're going to be lowering   our business tax from thirty-five   percent hopefully down to fifteen   percent which would take us from the   highest tax nation virtually in the   world it's terrible for business to one   of the lower tax not the lowest yet but   one of the lower tax the other thing   we're doing is regulations the   regulations are effective I asked Greg   and your folks you would probably say   regulations might be worse for you than   even the high taxes which is the biggest   surprise of the whole political   experience I thought taxes would be   number one regulations would be up there   someplace believe me these great leaders   of industry and even the small business   people who are just being crushed if   they had their choice between lower   taxes and a major massive cutting of   regulations they would take the   regulations I don't know how you feel   about that Greg but I just noticed i   wrote down because i heard it since   about six years ago 260 new federal   regulations have passed 53 of which   affect this plan 53 new regulations   massively expensive and probably none of   them amount to anything in terms of   safety or the things that you'd have   regulations for six of eight of the air   conditioning companies right now located   in mexico six of eight I mean think of   that and eighty percent of the supply   chain for Mexico eighty percent is   located in Mexico   and we're not going to have it anymore   so we're not going to have it anymore   and we like Mexico we think it's wonder   if i was there three months ago with the   President of Mexico terrific guy but we   have to have a fair shake we're not   getting anything we have NAFTA which is   a total and complete disaster it's a   total and complete disaster it's a one   lane highway into Mexico nothing coming   our way everything going their way and I   don't have to mention who signed it   anymore it's so nice I don't have to   mention who backed it anymore right we   don't have to mention that anymore   fortunately but it's a one-way street   and it's going to be changed it's going   to be changed we have to bring our jobs   back and when they expand and one of the   things that made me so happy is when   Greg said that they have over 10,000   jobs that they're going to be producing   in the very near future and now he's   looking to the United States instead of   outside of the united states where   almost all of those jobs would have gone   so one of the reasons i wanted to do   this particular conference is it so   great so many people in the other that   big big beautiful plant behind us which   will be even more beautiful in about   seven months from now they're so happy   they can have a great Christmas that's   most important but also I just want to   let all of the other companies know that   we're going to do great things for   businesses no reason for them to leave   anymore because your taxes are going to   be at the very very low end and your   unnecessary regulations are going to be   gone we need regulations for safety and   environment and things but most of the   regulations are nonsense become a major   industry the writing of regulations and   that these companies aren't going to be   leaving anymore they're not going to be   taking people's hearts out they're not   going to be announcing like they did at   carrier that they're closing up in the   moving to Mexico over 1,100 jobs and by   the way that number is going to go up   very substantially as they expand this   area of this plant so the 1100 s going   to be a   minimum number so I just want to thank   everybody and specifically I just have   to thank the people that I met backstage   credible people the spirit the love   people are crying I mean they're all   crying and it's taken us a little while   but think of this I don't think we even   announced we were running when this deal   was originally announced and in the end   what happened is because that makes it   much more difficult I mean it's hard to   negotiate when the plant is built you   know what Greg said Crick's it but you   know the plant is almost built right I   said Greg I don't care it doesn't make   any difference don't worry about it what   are we going to do with the plan to rent   it sell it knock it down I don't care   but we're going to do I'm going to do   fine with that plant I don't know if   they're going to be able to do with an   American company but we'll figure that   out but we're we're starting is from a   much easier place it's hard a year and a   half ago they make an announcement and   you know all of that work is done which   is why I have such respect i would say   great business people they have   flexibility you know if you're hardline   well we're not going to move flexibility   that's why they've done so well over the   years that's why it's a great company   because they have flexibility but we're   not going to need so much flexibility   for other companies because we are going   to have a situation where they're going   to know number one we're going to treat   them well and number two there will be   consequences meaning they'll be taxed   very heavily at the border if they want   to leave fire all their people leave   make product in different companies in   different countries and then think   they're going to sell that product over   the border which by the way will be a   very strong border very strong boner   believe me and and I think companies   we're gonna build a wall people saying   do you think Trump's going to build a   wall trust me we're going to build a   wall and by the way people are going to   come through there woah and up doors in   that wall but they're going to come   through legally and people are going to   come through on worker permits to work   the fields we're gonna have people a lot   of people going to come through but it's   going to be done through a legal process   but one thing that's not going to come   through   drugs the drugs are going to stop the   drugs are gonna stop so I just want to   thank all of the people at United   Technologies most particularly you   because you are fantastic right I want   to thank and I want you to tell me how   much how many air conditioning units you   sold in the last six months from today   because I want to say I think it's going   to be a number that even will surprise   your folks because of the tremendous   goodwill that you've created I want to   thank all of the workers at this plant   all of the carrier workers most   importantly I want to thank my great   great white vice president-elect cuz   I'll tell you what one of the really   good decisions but i want to thank Mike   and we're going to be doing this and if   i have to tell you know during speeches   i'd say they say it's not presidential   to call up these massive leaders of   business i think it's very presidential   and if it's not presidential that's okay   that's okay because i actually like   doing it but we're going to have a lot   of great people that can also do it and   do it as well as I do it but we're going   to have a lot of phone calls made to   companies when they say they're thinking   about leaving this country because   they're not leaving this country they're   not going to leave this country and the   workers are going to keep their jobs and   they can leave from state to state and   they can negotiate good deals with the   different states and all of that but   leaving the country is going to be very   very difficult so I want to thank   everybody we love you folks I want to   really really thank the people of   Indiana we had two massive victories in   a very very short period of time and all   of the workers have a great great   Christmas and a fantastic new year thank   you very much everybody thank you thank   you thank you very much   ah   [Music]   you

will decide whether we're   ruled by a corrupt political class or   whether we are ruled by yourselves the   people it is time to reject a failed   political elite that has bled this   country dry to all the people of   Pennsylvania I say we are going to put   the miners and the factory workers and   the steel workers back to work we're   bringing our companies back   the trade policies of Bill and Hillary   Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in   your state and throughout the country I   want to take this moment to share a   message with all of the Democratic   voters in our country who are thirsting   for change like everybody else everybody   is thirsting thirsting for change you're   tired of a government that works only   for Wall Street's and the special   interest you're tired of the reckless   foreign policy the crazy wars that are   never won Hillary Clinton is the last   stand for the wall street and special   interest donors and two special interest   themselves and Hillary is the face of   failure she's the face of failure she's   the face of failed foreign policy real   change begins she is indeed the face of   failure look at what she's done with   emails look at the mess look at the mess   and look at the corruption real change   begins immediately with the repealing   and replacing of the disaster known as   Obamacare   there's a great room we had great   victories in this room by the way great   50 service   and I went to school in pennsylvanian my   kids went to school in Pennsylvania so I   guess we assume it's a good place to   learn look have you been seeing the   polls by the way oh boy oh boy see the   dishonest people back there the media   the totally dishonest   they aren't so dis on   [Applause]   they are so dishonest sucks you can't   even read articles in certain papers   anymore New York Times is a total lie   you can't I mean you can't it is so   false nothing to do with me and I'm just   telling you such lies such lies such   fabrication such made-up stories and   other times is going out of business   pretty sure that's the good news but   such made-up stories such vicious   made-up stories but I'll tell you   they're going a little crazy because   we're leading in Ohio we're leading in   Iowa we're leading in New Hampshire   where I'm going to be in a little while   we're doing fantastically well in North   Carolina I think we're leading we I   believe are leading in Florida   and now Hilary just announced she's   going to additional stops she's going to   Michigan traditionally not really a   Republican state but you know I've been   talking I was man of the year in   Michigan a number of years ago and I   started telling and talking about your   car business is being stolen from you   I've been saying it for years and years   and years and you know what Michigan now   agrees we're leading in Michigan will   leading   and when I heard that crooked Hillary is   going there tonight she had to nobody   thought in terms of Michigan when I   heard I figured you know what I have   nothing to do tonight so I'll go there   tonight and give it the last word okay   so after this I'm going to New Hampshire   and then I'm going to Michigan oh we're   going to have a great victory tomorrow   folks the other girlfriend they have no   idea the dishonest media has no idea   actually they do have an idea they're   saying what is going on and look at   these people and look at this enthusiasm   there's nothing like it by the way Jess   I have to say this is considered the   history of this country this is actually   and you've been hearing it this is   considered the greatest movement   nobody's ever seen anything like this   huh nobody's ever seen anything like and   you know I was thinking today it's a   movement if you really think about it   it's a movement of common sense it's a   movement of competence it's not a   movement where we give a hundred and   fifty billion dollars to Iran where we   give them four hundred million dollars   in cash but that turns out to be one   point seven billion dollars in cash to   Iran for hostages for hostages which our   president lied about and just one other   thing why is he campaigning all the time   he ought to be working on jobs on   getting rid of Isis on our borders or in   our health care which is failing so   badly   boy oh boy and she can't get anybody to   go to a rallys so she gets jay-z he uses   the worst language I have ever heard and   by the time he's finished what's   happened what happens he infinity and   beyond say right there finish by that   time most of the people have left so she   thinks she's getting people by the time   she speaks to roll down anyway she   should just take a small room and talk   talk just take a small room and talk   it's just been announced that the   residents of Pennsylvania are going to   experience a massive double-digit   premium hike so high that I won't tell   you what it is it's very high all 67   counties in Pennsylvania most of which i   won in the primaries right almost all   almost every one of them are losing   Obamacare insurers next year I'd put you   in a bad position but the truth is not   going to matter because we are going to   repeal it and replace it not going to   matter don't worry about it so you can   leave your happy premiums are surging   companies are leaving ensures our fling   doctors are quitting and deductibles are   going through the roof yet crooked   Hillary Clinton wants to double down on   Obamacare making it even more expensive   than it is right now   I'm asking for your vote so we can   repeal and replace Obamacare and save   health care for every family in   Pennsylvania   and by the way for every family in this   country real change also means restoring   honesty to our government Hillary   Clinton is the most corrupt person ever   to seek the office of the presidency of   the United States she's threatened   national security she sold her office to   the highest bidder and then to cover her   tracks she deleted 33,000 emails after   receiving a congressional subpoena   [Applause]   [Applause]   she should not be allowed to run for   president she's being protected by a   rigged system and part of the rigged   system is the dishonest media believe me   they're rigging the system   true   it's true don't worry they never showed   the crowd as Bob said never they show my   face bumbum never shall declare it took   over a year for the FBI to review 50,000   days they reviewed 650,000 II Men   so now it's up to the American people to   deliver justice at the ballot box   tomorrow you got to get out and go let's   swamp him penciled and you let's wampum   you got to get out our country has never   ever done anything like they're doing   right now when it comes to justice james   Cartwright four-star general two weeks   ago admitted to one mistake and he did   it on the basis did it on the basis of   national security he said and I can   understand that he may go to jail for up   to five years general Petraeus's life   has been destroyed for doing one   one-hundredth of what Hillary Clinton   did so sad so sad it's a it's honestly   it's a disgrace and now she's allowed to   run for president and general Cartwright   will end up being in jail my contract   with the American voter begins with a   plan to end government corruption and   take back our country from the special   interests and the donor I want the   entire corrupt Washington establishment   to hear the words from all of us when we   win tomorrow we are going to Washington   DC to drain the swamp   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   they say we're tied in Pennsylvania I   don't think so I don't think so i think   we're going to blow him out tomorrow and   a lot of different ways low amount no   way this is not the sound of a   second-place finisher dr. know the have   a side don't forget we were 12 points   down three weeks ago and then after the   debates all of a sudden we started going   up we started going up and it was great   and now they have us even but I actually   think we're much better than that in   Pennsylvania I door so do you get out   there and vote at the core of my   contract is my plan to bring back our   jobs Pennsylvania has lost almost forty   percent of its manufacturing jobs since   NAFTA a deal signed by Bill Clinton and   supported by his lovely wife Hillary   cloudy lovely lady America has lost   seventy thousand factories since China   entered the World Trade Organization   another bill and hillary backed disaster   we are living through the greatest jobs   theft in the history of the world a   trump administration will stop the jobs   from leaving America and we will stop   the jobs finally from leaving   pennsylvania   and very simply folks very simply and   you haven't heard this very simply if a   company wants to fire their workers   leave Pennsylvania and move to another   country like Mexico and then ship their   products back into the United States we   will make them pay a thirty-five percent   tax on those products and you know   what's going to happen then I can leave   and if they do that's okay the country   will make a lot of money but they're not   going to live they're not going to live   now your politicians could have thought   of that some of them some of them can't   for they have other problems we will   renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst deals   probably thee not probably the single   worst trade deal ever made in the   history of this world it's true well   stand up to China and stop the   job-killing trans-pacific partnership   which Hillary Clinton wants you know she   called it the gold standard and then she   lied during the debate and she said I   never said that I said yes you did you   call it the gall said it turned out she   was lying turned out of course you could   look at it differently it is the gold   standard for the other side not for the   United States for the other side is good   how about this how about this how about   getting the questions for the debate   they fed her illegally they fed heard   the questions for the debate donna   Brazile they fed her the question said   that the bed and she never came and they   fed her the questions to the debate and   she didn't say I can't do this i'm sorry   is so unethical can you imagine if I was   given the questions of the debate what   would happen the biggest stories all   over though you don't even read this you   read a little bit about donna Brazile   but you don't read this they gave her   the questions to debates numerous   debates against Bernie Sanders and   Bernie Sanders he is really upset I   would bet you he would wish that he   didn't give her that little nod because   he made a deal with the devil you know   it he ruined the legacy he really had a   very important legacy going folks he   ruined his legacy when he did that and   he's got to be very embarrassed it's got   to be very very embarrassed as part of   our plan to bring back jobs we are going   to lower taxes on American business from   thirty-five percent to fifteen percent   and we will massively cut taxes for the   middle class the Forgotten people   they're forgotten men and women of this   country who built our country we will   massively lower taxes it's in our plaid   and I'll tell you Hillary and you see   her plan she is going to raise taxes   substantially folks with the highest tax   nation in the world she's going to raise   taxes figure that one out we will lift   the restrictions on American energy   including shale oil natural gas and   clean coal   Hilary has openly stated she wants to   shut down the mines and ban shale   production you folks can't be too happy   about that idea we are going to unleash   an energy revolution right here in   Pennsylvania we will cancel billions of   dollars in global warming payments to   the United Nations billions and billions   and billions and use that money to   rebuild the infrastructure of the United   States and we will put our miners back   to work and we will put our steel   workers back to work they're going back   to work we will rebuild our inner cities   the african-american community the   Hispanic community living in the inner   city have been treated very unfairly   crime that is so bad and I say it you   can't sometimes walk to a store you get   shot horrible education and no jobs no   jobs for a hundred years

Hillary Clinton   very much they're not showing up they   don't want to vote for the Hispanic   community the numbers are becoming great   you know the Cubans they gave me award   Bay of Pigs award

pV29MuEm3xo~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160928~Full Speech: Donald Trump Speech at Polish American Congress in Chicago, Illinois (9/28/2016)~51626.0~4.79267215729~1061.0~58.0~   ladies and gentlemen please welcome the   former associate attorney general under   President Ronald Reagan and two-term   mayor of the city of New York Rudy   Giuliani thank you very much thank you   I'll just be very brief I'm here to   introduce I'm here to introduce the   president of the Polish American   Congress who needs no introduction to   you Frank bula and I I ask for the   opportunity to say a few words if you   may okay so just don't be very brief   first first I should tell you for those   of you who are citizens to the city of   Chicago there's no city that helped New   York City more after September 11 then   Chicago you sent us more please send us   more firefighters he sent us more rescue   workers your Mayor Richard Daley is a   good friend of mine and at a time of   need he stepped up and there was so many   Chicago police in New York I got   confused I thought we had changed the   uniform you know to the little one with   the checks I was getting like a little   crazy I didn't know what happened   Donald Trump is here today because of   his love of the Polish community he has   a long-term abiding love for this   community and you can be sure when he   gets elected president nighted States   Poland will have once again a totally   reliable ally in the United States of   America   one of the acts that I have condemned   the most of the current Obama   administration done when Hillary Clinton   was Secretary of State was the reset of   the relationship with Russia because in   resetting that relationship she gave up   what my president the president is my   hero   she gave up his dream of a nuclear   defense of Poland in the Czech Republic   and in return for that as she did to so   many other deals iran-iraq she gave it   she got nothing for the United States   and nothing for Poland no guarantees of   non-aggression no guarantees of   lessening up on the deprivation of human   rights that go on in Russia or the   killings for that I once asked secretary   gates who is the defense secretary I   said in that agreement has always   troubled me the secretary gates we did a   panel together in Los Angeles six months   ago I don't understand it first of all   from a geopolitical basis I don't   understand it why would we give up the   nuclear defense of Poland or the Czech   Republic when we now know it works what   about the Iron Dome in Israel you know   back when Reagan announced it they made   him into like a nut for doing this   char's out Reagan was right if a missile   can shoot down a pointing a missile if   it's better to shoot down another   missile doesn't take a rocket scientist   excuse the pun to figure that out even a   stupid war like me can figure that out   but the New York Times putting in all   his critics so the Obama administration   began I believe double-crossing Poland   and the Czech Republic with Hillary   Clinton a prime architect and no matter   who was running on the other side you do   not have a trusted ally in either one of   the two of them because they took away   from you what was promised you a nuclear   defense   of your country if you elect Donald   Trump you will find a man who   understands that Poland unlike some of   the countries he's pushing a little for   a little more money   Poland pays its bills to NATO you should   be proud of that not only that he's   proud of you for doing it   so he'll defend the NATO treaty it's a   solemn obligation of the United States   yes he's going to push some of the   people that aren't paying their fair   share to pay more but that doesn't mean   he doesn't understand the solemn   obligation which is if any member of the   NATO alliance all 28 if any one of them   has attacked we all come to each other's   defense second he is going to do again   what Ronald Reagan did he's going to   rebuild our army or Navy or Air Force or   Marines this President and Secretary   Clinton want to decimate our military so   he will take our troops up to four   hundred and fifty thousand five hundred   and forty thousand Obama wants to take   him down to four hundred and twenty   thousand active troops we're over a   million with reserves that'll take the   reserves up to 1.3 number two he's going   to take our Navy which that they are   decimating they are ruining our Navy   we're going to go down to 240 ships I'm   not even sure we could patrol the   Atlantic with 240 ships we certainly   can't patrol the Atlantic and the   Pacific and we're supposed to be a two   ocean Navy he's going to build our Navy   to at least 350 shifts which is where it   has always been that allows us to go   into the South China Sea and push China   back it allows us to come in in the   middle of what's going on in the Ukraine   with an aircraft carrier so we can push   Putin back and I want you to know one   final thought about mr. Trump I known   for 28 years and I know they've been   some remarks about Putin and all of this   it is an old Putin he's ever met Putin   will he negotiate with Putin yes did   Reagan negotiate with Gorbachev yes   but he's going to negotiate with him   from a position of military strength   that Dwarfs the Soviet I'm sorry Russia   he will negotiate with peace through   strength   I know Putin that'll make a difference   he's a bully a bully pushes you around   until you stand up to him and you show   him an Army and Navy and Air Force and   the Marines that it would take him 50%   of his GDP to match and we costs us only   5% Donald Trump gets it this is a man   who knows how to negotiate I've never   seen him lose a negotiation it's going   to be a lot better than a permanent   government bureaucrat like Hillary   Clinton who gave away Poland in one of   her first acts in office or the   community organizer who's presently in   the White House so please support Donald   Trump you have a great leader in Frank's   pool the conversation upstairs was   enormous and enlightening for mr. Trump   and will help him greatly in his   understanding of the issues was Poland   that are there but they're all issues   between friends   we have no disagreements these are   things that can be solved by a person   like Donald Trump who's a doer like that   so I think working with Frank and many   of the people in your community we can   put Poland in the United States back on   the track that it used to be not where   we've gotten off track where you can   count on us as your defender and we can   count on you as one of our best friends   thank you very much   right ready okay there is no to   announcer Frank spool thank you Frank   thank you thank you thank you mr.   Giuliani good morning ladies and   gentlemen thank you all for coming and   thank you for your patience this morning   today is really a great day for our   community here in Chicago   for one you know we've got a candidate   that's aspiring for office of the   president United States of America for   one and you know I need to share with   you as a community we've had a very good   meeting of stairs we talked about   various issues that are of concern for   us as as Americans and as polls as well   we touched on many many topics that are   concern to us within the community as   first the Polish American Congress   itself so our meeting was very positive   all in all we've got to say that mr.   Trump is really on top of these issues   of the questions that were asked of him   and I know that mr. Giuliani has spoken   on some topics that we address the   stairs in the boardroom and I think you   really don't want to hear me you really   want to hear what maybe the future   President of the United States Donald   Trump has to say let's give Donald Trump   a warm welcome   [Applause]   [Applause]   thank you everybody very much great on a   piece again thank you   so we have a very interesting race we've   had some amazing days   I love the debate I love the process   something very beautiful about this   process the American Way but it's a lot   of different ways but there's nothing   like what we're going through it's very   exciting   and to have so many Polish Americans on   my side been friends of mine for many   years I've had so many friends they've   been so loyal to me from Poland some   living in Poland now but mostly from   Poland and the Polish people are great   people these are great people and if I   get elected believe me we take care of   all of our people all of our people but   we do have a very very special place   because polish Americans what you've   done for this country is really   incredible and I don't think frankly   that people know the great sacrifices   that you've gone through and Frank and   the whole group have done an incredible   job even just coming to this building   and seeing how well organized everything   is how beautiful it is how clean how you   open it up to the community Frank it's   amazing so I just want to congratulate   you and I want to thank you thank you   I just I just met many of your leaders   and representatives in your press and I   thought I'd say a few words I wrote down   a few words about Poland and my thoughts   on Poland and also on what's happening   with respect to the Polish Americans and   I think it'll take a second and I'll   read it off a little bit to you because   it's very important to me it's very   important it's an unbelievably important   community so I'm honored to be here with   the Polish American Congress and I   pledge to you a trump administration   will be a true friend to Poland and to   all polish Americans and I have to tell   you and I don't think you people will be   insulted to say and if I say Winry   friend to everybody we're going to be   friendly to everybody you know you heard   about the deplorable x' right this is   going to be one of those two probably   going to be a friend to everybody then   if they don't like me they will end up   liking me all right I'll be a friend   even when they don't like me but they   will end up liking me when we produce   because we have politicians that don't   produce it's very simple and Poland has   been such an incredible friend to   America and since our founding if you   look it's been one of our great great   relationships and so important strong   ally for freedom during the Cold War   Poland kept the flame of freedom under   communist oppression it was really it   was a beacon and Poland provided twenty   eight thousand troops in total over the   years to assist the United States and   Afghanistan as a lot of troops   twenty-eight thousand troops for   Afghanistan and Iraq in the hardest fort   regions and plenty of suffering plenty   of suffering one of the things I wanted   to do is mention your very brilliant   head of the Chamber of Commerce Anna   who's just stand up Anna   very important who's going to Poland   tomorrow but she said mr. Trump would it   be possible for you to say something   about small business and in particular   because people want to come in they want   to open small business I said well the   most important thing we can do is taxes   but really maybe even more important   than taxes are regulations because the   regulations in our country have become   so horrible   so cumbersome so bureaucratic in that   it's really becoming almost impossible   to open a small business whether we're   dealing with Polish Americans or whether   we're dealing with any Americans it's   horosho and also whether we're dealing   with small business or big business even   to expand businesses almost it's very   hard it's almost impossible in many   cases so we're going to make sure that   when people come into the country or   when people are already in the country   they're going to be able to open their   business and also we're cutting taxes   massively the thing that amazes me is   that if you would have told me this I   wouldn't have thought you know we're   cutting business tax tremendously for   small business and for all business   because we want jobs we're going to have   a job growth like we've never seen   I'm very good for jobs in fact I will be   the greatest president for jobs that God   ever created that I could tell you I'm   very strong on jobs and the economy had   built a great I built a great great   company and some of the most incredible   assets real estate assets anywhere in   the world and some other assets but and   I understand putting people to work and   if you would have told me this would   have happened I think the mayor of New   York Rudy who has been so incredible as   a supporter we've had such great support   but Rudy's been really out there he was   a great mayor I think Rudy would   understand this very well some of the   people in the audience would so we're   doing this massive tax cut and yet in my   opinion almost a hundred percent of the   time people that want businesses and   want to expand businesses or start new   businesses are much more excited about   the regulations being cut because the   regulations are making it absolutely and   by the taxes are terrible because   they're so high this   so owners that they really make it very   difficult but I think that people are   more excited about the massive cutting   of regulations that we're going to do   and you need some regulation for safety   for environment you need some regulation   but we're going to be cutting tremendous   amounts of red tape and regulation and I   would never have thought that they're   more impressed with that that they   consider that to be more important than   the cutting of taxes because in one case   you know the kind of money we're talking   about in the other case you know it's a   little amorphous you don't know but   they're very excited so and we will take   care of that situation and I think you   and all of the people that you're   representing will be very happy   okay now as president I will honor   Poland's sacrifices for freedom we're   committed to a strong Poland very   committed totally committed then a   strong Eastern Europe as a bulwark for   security and liberty campaigning for his   wife   Bill Clinton attacked Poland saying   democracy is too much trouble which was   an interesting statement wasn't it   democracy is too much trouble and for   Poland apparently because he he   disagreed with Poland's opposition to   bringing in refugees and yet his wife   wants to bring in refugees from Syria at   a rate of five hundred and fifty percent   more then Obama who's bringing them in   by the thousands and thousands and   thousands so the Bill Clinton made that   statement and he talked about for Poland   and all of the time I'm talking about   we can't allow people to come into this   country from other parts of the world   that we don't know who they are where   they come from what their intentions are   and all you have to do is take a look at   what happened whether it's in New York   or whether it's in San Bernardino or   whether it's in Orlando or frankly you   go outside of the country very nicely   also Paris and nice and all of the   different places   Germany look what's happening in Germany   it's a disaster   and yet Bill Clinton will make a   horrible statement like that concerning   Poland so Poland is one of the only five   NATO nations countries that's actually   paying 2% of GDP to provide for their   defense which is very interesting   because I have been talking about it you   know so many of them are delinquent   they're in default essentially but   they're delinquent Poland is is up to   date and what happened as soon as I   walked in the whole group said we're up   to date we're up to date they were very   proud of it that's the Polish people   that's it they want to they want to be   proud so we want NATO to be strong which   means we want more countries to follow   the example of Poland if every country   in NATO made the same contributions as   Poland all of our allies would be more   secure and people would feel better even   better about NATO NATO is very important   but they'd feel better about it will   work with Poland on strengthening NATO   when I am president we will strengthen   NATO and we're going to bring NATO and   get NATO involved with terrorism as you   remember six or seven months ago when I   was asked by a reporter about what do I   think about NATO I said it's obsolete   because it doesn't cover Tara and it was   a big scream Oh Trump is saying it's   obsolete then about three days later   they said you know he's right it's   obsolete doesn't cover terror this is a   new threat and then a few months after   that on the front page of The Wall   Street Journal and this was probably   four or five months ago they announced   his starting a new terrorism division   which will be run by a very good person   actually and they can give me a lot of   credit for that but they did put my name   in the article and they did say that you   know I brought it up but I do believe if   I didn't bring it up and bring it up   very strongly and loudly they would not   have started it but I think it's a great   thing that they did the contributions of   the Polish Polish people to America have   enriched every aspect of our lives   and will be honored if I am in the white   house the Polish people will be honored   remember that they deserve it so I'm   asking for your vote I'd never thought   I'd be saying that for the business but   can you believe but watching these guys   all their lives I'm asking gee about the   difference is then they do nothing for   you they you know we're going to make   things good we're going to make America   great again but I'm asking for your vote   and I'm asking for very importantly your   friendship and your partnership we're   going to work together and we're going   to start now we're going to have a   victory in November it's going to be a   tremendous victory and we're going to   have a Trump administration that's going   to get things done that's going to lower   taxes Hillary Clinton who I happen to   believe is grossly incompetent by the   way I just feel she's grossly income but   Hillary Clinton is going to increase   taxes and it well she didn't pass her   bar exam in Washington DC and a lot of   people don't know that but I happen to   believe that that should be very very   bad for our country I think it would be   worse than four more years of Obama they   would actually be worse and it won't   won't be great for the people that   you're representing but most importantly   it won't be great for the people of our   country because we have a chance to   really make America great again we have   a chance to I think make America greater   than ever before   and whether it's tax whether it's trade   whether it's regulation there's so many   different things that we're going to do   but we're going to spur growth and we're   going to spur growth in the right   direction not in the wrong direction so   I just want to thank all of the folks   that I met today and all of your   leadership and I will tell you I will   never let you down it will be an amazing   thing that's going to happen on November   8th you know when I was right in the   middle of brexit because I was in Europe   and I have a lot of property in Europe I   own a lot of great   property in Europe and they asked me the   question they said mr. Trump what do you   think of BRICS it will it pass and   everybody virtually was saying it won't   Obama said no way in fact he went over   and campaigned against it as you know   and that's probably the reason it passed   because I actually think I actually   think fact when I heard that way I told   two of the newspapers over there I said   is he really over he said no he's   campaigning very much in favor of you   know keeping it the old way the way it   was right which was a disaster I said   well if he's campaigning I'm going the   opposite way of him so I said that   brexit will happen what happened anyway   that was two days before and everybody   printed out Trump is totally saying that   you know brexit is is not that it's   going to happen and it was amazing it   was amazing what happened so when the UK   brilliantly decided to get out they   totally forgot what I said they totally   forgot and as you know the person most   in charge that really this was his he   formulated this whole idea along with   some other great people but he came out   and made a speech for me a month ago was   incredible and now they're calling me   mister brexit because in a way we're   very similar to what happened over there   we want our independence back we want   our freedom back we don't want to take   people into our country that we don't   want we don't want to take people into a   country that possibly have very bad   intentions we don't want to take our I   mean we have so many problems we owe   almost 20 trillion dollars it's it's   doubled under President Obama's term   twenty trillion dollars so over two   hundred years we developed debt in seven   and a half years by the time he gets out   of office it will more than have doubled   and what have we gotten for it nothing   we have roads that are collapsing we   have highways and bridges and tunnels   that are   in a horrible state of repair we have   hospitals and schools that are   disastrous in our airports a third-world   you go to Dubai and Qatar and you go to   China and different places you see   airports are the most incredible things   that you've ever seen you come into   LaGuardia in New York you come into   Kennedy you come into LAX you come into   Newark Airport these are like third   world airports with third world   equipment and this is the United States   well it's going to end we spent six   trillion dollars six trillion through   gross incompetence we spent six trillion   dollars in the Middle East and think of   it six trillion we could have rebuilt   our country twice we built things over   there that we don't build for our own   country and then it's bombed and   destroyed so we're going to run things   differently we're going to be tough we   have a very depleted military we have to   build up our military again we have to   build up our military but it's going to   be something I think that's going to be   very beautiful and very good and it's   going to be great for all people   including my really great Polish   American friends so I just want to leave   it by saying I'm with you I agree with   you there was a roomful of incredible   representatives and as they were talking   I'm saying you don't have to sell me   everything you're talking about I mean   what's not to agree with and the great   thing about everything that took place   in that meeting that we just had is that   you love this country you love our   country you want what's good for our   country and so we're all in the same   we're all in the same bag   so I just want to thank you I want to   thank your leadership I want to thank   everybody in this room I hope that I get   every single Polish American vote in   this country and if anybody is on   vacation come back immediately one thing   about the Polish people when they go on   vacation they usually go to Poland right   it's true I know they go to Poland they   don't go elsewhere so get them back but   it's really been a great honor and thank   you all very much thank you thank you   very much vishay mr.

Trump you don't have to   you're leading by so much you don't have   to i said what do you mean i don't have   to i want to go to iowa which is sure I   want to go to Iowa and the incredible   leadership that you have in this state   unbelievable so I just want to begin by   thanking Iowa laterz here today   lieutenant governor Kim Reynolds where   is Kim come on up Kim come on come on   Kim a man that I've gotten to know very   well over the years and somebody that's   respected outside of Iowa like you   wouldn't believe inside of Iowa so much   that he's the longest-serving governor   in the history of the united states   terry Branstad   by the way Terry came to my office and   he was talking to me about trade I think   there's nobody that knows more about   trade than him he's one of the ones in   dealing with China well you would be   your who you would be our prime   candidate to take care of Johnny he's   done so well so well for the people of   Iowa nobody knows it better Congressman   Steve King great guy great guy I even   like him when he was endorsing Ted he   was endorsing and I still liked him so   Steve he came around it took him a   little while but he came around thank   you very much food and a woman who i got   to know because as you know she was on a   very short list and she loves the people   of Iowa and she felt she needed a little   it wasn't me it wasn't me she felt she   needed a little more seasoning maybe and   I said isn't that refreshing when you   hear that from somebody and she is now   season because there's nobody that does   a better job representing their people   than Joni Ernst and a great person   Joanie come on   [Applause]   thank you very much incredible people   whenever they run just keep voting for   you have to always vote for them it's in   two years or four years or 20 years   you're never going to do better than   that in two days can you believe this we   are going to win the great state of Iowa   and we are going to win back the White   House   and I want to thank the people of Iowa   you have opened up your hearts to me so   much incredible it's been just   incredible our evening here the other   night with the fireworks everything is   always beautiful in Iowa real challenge   begins with immediately repealing and   replacing Obamacare a disaster right   they're all saying it please it's just   been announced that the residents of   Iowa are going to have and experienced a   massive double-digit premium hike like I   know the number I will not tell you I   never do this with any of the groups I   don't say the number because it's so   depressing right now everyone's happy   we're having a good time even though the   subject matter is difficult but we're   going to make it great but I will say   this the Obamacare is out of control in   the great state of Arizona premiums are   going up more than one hundred and   sixteen percent just left Arizona and   they are very unhappy with what's going   on over half of the counties in Iowa a   losing Obamacare insurers next year   tough to negotiate it's honestly not   going to matter because we're going to   have it terminated by then so we win   we'll have it terminated so we won't we   won't have any problems governor okay   will terminate it it'll be gone you'll   be just a bad memory premiums are   surging companies are leaving ensures a   fleeing doctors acquitting and   deductibles are going through the roof   you have deductibles at fifteen sixteen   seventeen thousand dollars could you   believe it yet Hillary Clinton wants to   double down on Obamacare making it even   more expensive far more expensive   I'm asking for your vote so we can   repeal and replace Obamacare and save   health care for every family in Iowa and   for every family in our great country so   important just remember Obamacare got to   get rid of it real change means   restoring honesty to our government   there's little doubt that FBI director   Comey and the great special agents   within the FBI will be able to collect   more than enough evidence to garner   indictments against Hillary Clinton and   our inner circle despite her effort to   disparage and discredit the FBI   [Applause]   if she were to win it would create an   unprecedented constitutional crisis in   that situation we could very well have a   sitting president under felony   indictment and ultimately a criminal   trial just today we learned Hillary   Clinton was sending highly classified   information through her maid did you see   just came out a little while ago who   therefore had total access to this   information completely jeopardizing the   national security of the United States   it's just came out WikiLeaks we need a   government that can go to work on day   one for the American people that will be   impossible with Hillary Clinton the   prime suspect in a far-reaching criminal   investigation her current scandals and   controversies will continue throughout   her presidency and will make it   virtually impossible for her to govern   let's hope we don't have to think about   it if you ever got into the Oval Office   Hilary and her special interest would   rob our country blind that's what she's   been doing at the heart of this election   is a simple question will our country be   governed by the people or will it be   governed by the corrupt political class   we're going to find out very soon if we   win the corrupt politicians and their   special interest laws if we win the   American people and you understand that   if we win what's going to happen to the   American people   if we win you're going to be so happy   because if we win our country is going   to start winning again we don't win   anymore our country is going to start   winning again it's just that simple   speaking in a secret Wall Street meeting   Hillary Clinton admitted that she wants   to cut Medicare and Social Security   Hillary Clinton is going to destroy your   Social Security and Medicare she even   wants to give your benefits to illegal   immigrants and you've seen that all of I   am going to protect and save your Social   Security and your Medicare you made a   deal a long time ago a long time ago and   I will protect American workers the   political and media elite have no idea   what it's like to be living in a   paycheck paycheck to paycheck basis not   knowing whether or not the owners and   leaders of their company are negotiating   to move their plant or factory to Mexico   or some other country and fire them   sometimes with virtually no notice   happening all over the country it's not   going to happen with us folks not it's   not going to happen with   politicians don't understand what that's   like the media and the political elite   don't know the pain and the suffering   these people are living on but I figured   it out a long time ago and that's why   I'm here I'm with you rather than where   i was i was on the other side i was on   the other side i understand it well i   understand the other side well i was   enjoying my life for many years on the   other side but i also love our country   and i will tell you our country was   going bad our country was going not only   in the wrong direction our country was   going bad and on june sixteenth of last   year i went from being a true insider to   perhaps the ultimate outsider ever ever   I don't know I think so right what do   you think care might think so pretty   much huh these people that I've known   all my life to think Donald what   happened we are going to make America   great again that's what happened you are   the people that built our country and we   are going to give you the respect that   you deserve Hillary's an insider   fighting only for herself and a special   interests I'm an outsider I become an   outsider fighting for you I'm not a   politician you the American people are   my only special interest so if that's   what I'm doing it that's what I'm doing   it   and it's a lot of work folks I will tell   you a lot more work than I ever thought   but it is a movement in this country the   likes of which our country has never   seen even the extremely dishonest media   back there they will say there is no   there has never been anything like this   this is far bigger than Bernie Sanders   that was a smart and by the way many of   his people believe it or not are coming   to our site because they agree with me   on trade they realize how we're being   ripped apart on trade and he should have   never made a deal he sold his soul to   the devil when he made that deal he   ruined his legacy but many of the Bernie   people are coming over to us because of   trade and our stance on trade is tougher   and smarter and better than his but they   understand that and they're coming over   the media wall street and the   politicians are trying to stop us   because they know we will fix the rigged   system that has enriched them for so   many years but very much at your expense   very very much I've spent a life in   business creating tens of thousands of   jobs I built a great great company but   I've spent a whole life I've employed   tens of thousands of Americans but when   I saw what was happening to our country   I just felt I had to act I had to act   and I acted   I am so that's what I made my move and   that's the way the movies that's what we   made our more thank you very much june   sixteenth famous day right do you   remember coming down the escalators oh   boy but I don't mind being an outsider I   don't mind this is our last chance folks   I think the governor would agree with me   so much we have one chance it's our last   chance it's on Tuesday it's the eighth   it's our last chance now some of you   have voted how many of you have voted   not so actually I like it because our   numbers are looking very good but now I   know what you like more people Tuesday   is going to be a very good day but this   this is our last chance because and I'm   talking as a country because it's never   going to happen again never going to   happen again and I was sort of saying it   last time but this time I say it and we   have so many things to do and we can do   them some of them easily some of its   common sense there's no common sense the   Iran deal 150 billion dollars going back   to Iran   and then we're going to give them four   hundred million dollars in cash right   but the 400 million turned out to be one   point seven billion dollars Terry's   looking at me saying that's not possible   1.7 billion 1.7 billion we could use   that we could do a hell of a job in Iowa   with 1.7 that's in Terry that's in green   that's cash that'd go up to the ceiling   1.7 billion in cash and obama lied he   said it wasn't for hostages but they   wouldn't let the hostages go until the   money came in so many lies lied on   Obamacare you can have your doctor you   can have your plan 28 different times   you can have you adopt him you could   have your plan many Democrats who didn't   want to approve it approved it based on   that lie because it just made it   unfortunately it just made it but going   out and voting it's your last chance   it's your last chance to make our   country truly truly truly great again we   have such potential my contract with the   American voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption and to take back   our country from the special I want the   entire corrupt Washington establishment   other than our great congressman over   Hayes not cool where's our Congress I'm   not talking about you congressman and   i'm not talking about everybody but boy   they're a lot of them to hear the words   we are all about to say when we win or   november eighth we are going to drain   the swamp   [Music]   that was an expression I tell people I   thought it was so hokey I thought that   was so hokey I said no way I'm ever   saying that and then I went before a big   group like this and by the way this room   is packed and there are thousands of   people outside they can't get in which   is amazing but I gave that expression at   his speech and I golike very timidly   drain the swamp place like really liked   it then I sit with more energy the next   time and they really liked it and then a   third time they really really and then   now people are going crazy they're   screaming at me when I'm speaking drain   the swamp in between that and build the   wall these are two expressions and we   will build the world so you never know   about things right I tell the story   Frank Sinatra Frank Sinatra didn't like   my way to song my way great something   he's like it then he sang it the   audience loved it sang it again the   audience really loved it then it went   out became the number one song all of a   sudden they loved it bread he loved it   became his favorite song just about at   the core of my contract is my plan to   bring jobs back to our country and to   Iowa we're going to bring our jobs back   our economy's growth is anemic the worst   since the Great Depression you don't   hear them my jobs plan begins with a   proposal to lower taxes on American   business from thirty-five percent to   fifteen percent and that's a massive tax   cut for the family farms and the folks   in Iowa that works so hard and end up   with very little left after taxes and   going to further protect our family   farmers   I'm going to protect them like they have   never been protected before I mean   honestly or I would have one big enemy   in Terry that i can tell you and we're   going to protect corn-based ethanol   Hillary Clinton's plan will shut down   family farms all over the nation just   like closed up the mines well let me   tell you the miners are going back to   work and the steel workers are going   back to work and have clean call but the   miners are going back to work she will   do this not only through radical EPA   regulation but also by raising taxes to   rates as high as almost fifty percent   Hillary also wants to substantially   increase the death tax on family farms   you know you have a farm it would be   nice to leave it to your children right   it's tough tough we're going to get rid   of it on top of that her anti energy   agenda will radically drive up the cost   of energy another attack on agriculture   big big attack on agriculture we will   reverse the obama-clinton EPA intrusion   and eliminate job-killing regulations   that hurt the people of Iowa and really   hurt the farms   you know the one thing and I was telling   the governor your governor the last time   I we're giving massive with the highest   oxidation in the world and we're giving   massive tax cuts but we're also cutting   very substantially the regulations and   we want clean air we want clean water   and we want safety but beyond that but I   was just saying we are you know you look   at all of the different things the thing   that they most want people are the cut   and regulations even more important to   them more important than the massive tax   cuts are the cuts in regulations because   they have killed our businesses they're   killing our businesses especially our   small businesses and I would have been   surprised and I was surprised more   important than the tax cuts is exactly   that we will also rebuild our inner   cities very unfair what's happening to   our african-american communities very   unfair what's happening to our Latino   communities we will become a rich nation   once again but to be a rich nation we   must also be a safe nation Hillary   Clinton wants a five hundred and fifty   percent increase in Syrian refugees   pouring into our country   and that's over the thousands and   thousands that Obama is allowed and   allowing to come in and by the way he's   always campaigning he's always   campaigning you know he should go to the   Oval Office and he should work on jobs   he should work on knocking the hell out   of Isis and not giving them a four month   notice we're coming into Mosul and four   months we will be attacking Mosul at   four months because we want to get the   leaders of Isis of this bag and muscle   well after the announcements about two   seconds old they're gone now we have   people that are very sad her plan will   import generations of terrorism   extremism and radicalism into your   schools and throughout your communities   when I'm elected president we will   suspend the Syrian refugee program and   we will keep radical Islamic terrorists   the hell out of our country we have no   choice we have enough problem   and we all have heart and we're going to   build safe zones in Syria and we can   have the Gulf states we are 20 trillion   dollars occasion not sure about it we   have lots of problems but we will have   the Gulf states who have tremendous   money tremendous and they haven't been   carrying their way they haven't done   much haven't accepted any we're going to   have the Gulf states they'll be happy to   do it take it a pay for it but we're   going to build safe zones but we can't   have them come into our country too much   uncertainty we just we have enough   problems wouldn't you say we have enough   problems so we'll take care a trump   administration will also secure and   defend the borders of the United States   and yes we will build a great wall we're   going to keep the drugs out we're going   to keep the poison out of our country   that's destroying our youth and plenty   of other people as Secretary of State   Hillary Clinton allowed thousands and   thousands of the most dangerous and   violent criminal aliens to go free   because their home countries would not   under any circumstances take them back   can you imagine that they catch   murderers drug dealers the worst people   the worst people they bring them back in   their country says we're not taking them   they go through the Secretary of State   she said bring them back and the crime   that's been committed by these people is   unbelievable I promise you this there   won't be one instance not one where when   we bring somebody back to their country   where they belong where that plane comes   back with that person sitting on that   plane there won't be one instance the   roughly one   will never happen truly called a lack of   respect for our country Hillary supports   totally open borders there goes your   country and strongly supports sanctuary   cities like San Francisco where Kate   Steinle was murdered by an illegal   immigrant who was deported at least five   times thousands of Americans would be   alive today if not for the open border   policies of Obama and Clinton this   includes incredible Americans like 21   year old Sarah root who you know about   who you've read about who was right from   Iowa right from here credible person   I've spent time with her incredible   family beautiful family devastated the   illegal immigrant who killed Sarah   arrived at the border entered federal   custody and then was released into the   community despite the pleas of people   that knew him please don't do this don't   do this right under the policies of the   White House he was released again and   again but then he killed Sarah in a   savage savage way Sarah graduated from   college with a four-point-oh grade index   number one in her class the day before   she was killed there's so many instances   like this so many instances like this   and people knew trouble but the   administration said we don't get   involved a trump administration will end   this nightmare of violence that's going   on all over   we will stop illegal immigration deport   all criminal aliens and dismantle every   last criminal gang in cartel threatening   our citizens and we're going to build   that wall it's going to be a great wall   and let me just tell you Mexico's gonna   pay for the wool they don't know it yeah   they don't know yeah they're starting   have a very good idea but that's okay   you know Mexico it take great I met with   the President of Mexico three months ago   great but it's got to be a two-lane   highway you know we lose so much we lose   our plants we lose our jobs we lose our   wealth and we get drugs and unemployment   it's got to be a two-way and it will be   because the trade deficit with China and   so many of these countries but the trade   deficit with mexico is massive far   greater than what we're talking about   for the wall so a lot of politicians and   you can't get Mexico to pay for the wall   I said oh it's going to be so easy going   to be so easy but here's what you have   to understand we're going to have big   beautiful doors in that wall and people   are going to come into our country and   they're going to come into our country   people lots of people are going to come   into our country but they're coming into   our country legally they come in   [Applause]   okay thank you very much everybody we   will we're going to straighten things   out we're going to end up with very   strong borders believe me very very   strong borders we will also repeal Obama   Clinton defense sequester and rebuild   our badly depleted military badly before   I'm honored to have the endorsement of   more than 200 top Admirals and generals   and 22 medal of honor recipients Hillary   and our failed establishment have spent   six trillion dollars on wars in the   Middle East that we never win and now   it's in worse shape than ever before the   Middle East is in far worse shape than   it's ever been even from our standpoint   they've dragged us into foreign wars   that have made us less safe they've   shipped our jobs and our wealth to other   countries and left our borders wide open   at home we send our troops to foreign   countries to defend their borders but   our politicians refuse they refuse to   defend our borders is an amazing we   fight forget the money the blood the   great people the great people the loss   and we fight to defend a border but we   don't defend their own borders that will   change or november eighth Olivia a trump   administration will never ever put the   interests of a foreign country before   the interests of our country from now on   it's going to be America first   to all Americans I say this it is time   for real leadership and it is time for   change we're going to change Hillary   Clinton has not changed Hillary Clinton   is four more years of Obama which is   Isis which is all of these other things   high taxes just think about what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trump

Amendment which is   constantly under siege and appoint   justices to the United States Supreme   Court who will uphold and defend the   Constitution of the United States it's   time to cut our ties

child to drugs and crime and gang   violence we're fighting for every   community whose jobs and dreams have   been ripped out and shipped to other   countries one of the primary reasons I   got involved in this I couldn't watch it   anymore as our companies i live in new   york new york state New York State what   happened to new york state with the jobs   going to Mexico and other places and   when Hillary Clinton was senator she   said she ran on the basis that she would   create new jobs I'll tell you what just   another lie it's worse than ever ever   ever before she did nothing

our government   we're going to renegotiate our terrible   and I mean terrible trade deals and   illegal immigration stop the massive   inflow of refugees reduce surging crime   cut taxes big league cut regulations   even bigger league unleash job producing   American energy cherish and defend faith   and religious liberty and we are going   to get rid of the Johnson amendment I   hope you know what the Johnson amendment   is because it is a disaster for our   great people and for our church we will   also repeal and replace the disaster   known as Obamacare   President Obama promised the American   people that his plan would be affordable   instead health insurance premiums are   going through the roof and companies are   being driven out of business totally out   of business many companies are being   forced to flee the country they're   leaving our country they're creating   jobs in other countries instead and now   Hillary Clinton wants to double down and   make Obamacare bigger and worse and much   more expensive and it doesn't get any   more expensive Obamacare is now   unaffordable and so on the for   affordable that even the Democrats are   admitting it just this month the   Democratic governor of Minnesota said   the reality is the Affordable Care Act   is no longer affordable and Bill Clinton   who had a rough evening that evening   called Obamacare the craziest thing in   the world he said that small businesses   and middle-class Americans are getting   killed and he was telling the truth this   election is our one chance to get rid of   Obamacare and the cost of Obamacare it   doesn't work and it's too expensive your   jobs will come back under a trump   administration your incomes will go up   under a trump administration your taxes   will go way way down under a trump   administration   and Hillary Clinton is raising your   taxes your companies won't be leaving   Virginia under a trump administration   they'll be staying we will be a strong   nation again we're going to rebuild the   depleted military we have the greatest   people on earth but our military is   depleted with the equipment we're using   and other things we are going to totally   rebuild our military we are going to   start with the Navy right here in   Virginia Beach as part of our plan to   create a 350 ship fleet little creek and   Naval Air Station Oceana are going to   get a lot busier when I'm president get   ready how many people are from there how   many people do we have that's a lot of   people norfolk naval shipyard is to   watch they're going to get very busy   folks get ready they're going to be   right at the center of the action of the   building of new ships when it comes to   the military i believe in three very   very important words peace through   strength   but we also need smart strategy   WikiLeaks shows that John Podesta said   of Hillary she has bad instincts no we   knew that just look at her career one of   her closest ally said she doesn't seem   to know what to plan it and what planet   were living in look at her record she's   been there for 30 years and what has she   fixed nothing she unleash death   destruction and failure in every country   she touched in the Middle East Iraq   Libya Syria Iran Hillary's catastrophic   failures Unleashed Isis came right out   of the vacuum which is now on a campaign   of genocide against Christians in the   Middle East and all over the world I   mean think of what's happened think of   what's going on it started as a small   group of people and now Isis is in 32   countries under her watch and now you   hear that Hillary's going to do   something about Isis that's not going to   happen folks that's not going to happen   at home she failed on the economy and   she failed in upstate New York right now   our economy isn't growing at all we had   only around one percent growth last   quarter and a horrible jobs report on   Thursday I'm going to get us to a four   percent growth and maybe more than that   and create 25 million jobs over a   ten-year period   many workers are earning less today than   they were 18 years ago working harder   and longer and making less and they're   older but I'm working harder and longer   and I'm older too so I don't feel sorry   for you okay some of them are working   two and three jobs but still taking home   less money for them and their families   companies like carrier of firing their   workers and moving to Mexico Ford is   moving all of its small car production   divisions to Mexico when I'm president   if companies want to fire their workers   and leave for Mexico or other places   then we will charge them a thirty-five   percent tax when they want to ship their   new products back into the United States   and they won't be leaving very easily   [Music]   Hillary Clinton has raised countless   millions of dollars from big donors who   want to ship our jobs overseas and to   other countries you know that with that   money she's out spending our campaign in   some ways by fifty to one in ads we have   markets where it's fifty to one and   we're tied it's pretty good right our   campaign is going and take it on these   big donors and interestingly polls just   came out today we're we're leading in   three major polls leading nation while   so that's   despite all of the wall street money   that's being spent against us and it's   going to take on and we're going to take   on the big donors we're going to take on   big bonus and I'll tell you what the big   business in this country and I'm a part   of it but I decided I've been on the   other side you do know that right I   understand the other side it's a very   easy side to be on and I've been there a   long time and I looked out and I said if   I'm going to stay there i will tell you   our country is in big trouble our   country's in trouble because it's the   wrong thing I love this country I didn't   need to do this I love this country and   that's why I'm doing it and we have a   movement going like they've never had   before we have a movement going folks   like they've never seen before in this   country get out and vote though   otherwise the movement comes to an end   [Music]   thank you this is a great great movement   this is a movement seriously like they   have never seen before in this country   we are driving them crazy WikiLeaks even   shows the Clinton campaign speaking with   contempt about Catholics and   evangelicals and then boasting gleefully   about very friendly and malleable   reporters who shower the Clintons with   praise fanelli's   our system is rigged and I've been   saying it for a long time and the best   evidence is that Hillary Clinton is even   allowed to run for the presidency of the   United States in the first place   [Music]   she lied to Congress under oath she lied   to the FBI and she made 13 phones   disappear some with a hammer did anybody   out there ever lose their phone with a   hammer and he will please raise your   head nobody well but you are a great   group of people   by the way we have two of our great   generals three of our great generals and   we have right here right here general   Kellogg arisia Hendrick fellows ratio   and   and we have a man that you've never   heard of named Giuliani the mayor of   doing oh come on get over here Rudy   [Music]   great guy New York City was not doing   well and it was crime-infested and after   a year of Rudy it was starting to look   good and after two years boy what a   difference in to this day what a   difference he made he something great   job Rudy   [Applause]   she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails   and then two crucial boxes of email   evidence mysteriously went missing   [Music]   you know we have a four-star general who   is now got the potential to serve five   years in prison and pay a massive fine   this was two days ago for doing   something that was a tiny tiny fraction   of what took place with Hillary Clinton   and it's a sad day for this country   what's going on with her with the FBI   with the Department of Justice this is a   sad time in the United States believe me   and you all know it a trump   administration will end government   corruption we will also end economic   stagnation my plan for the economy can   be summed up in three very beautiful   words jobs jobs jobs   [Music]   at the center of my jobs plan will be   fixing our terrible trade deals 47   million Americans are in poverty and 45   million Americans are on food stamps   this is in our country 45 million we   have nearly an 800 billion dollar annual   trade deficit in goods with the World   Trade and the worst so-called recovery   since the Great Depression we also have   something else the murder rate in the   United States is the highest it's been   in 45 years Virginia has lost one in   three of its manufacturing jobs since   NAFTA signed by Clinton a deal that was   supported very strongly by Hillary we've   lost listen to this number seventy   thousand factories since china's entry   into the World Trade Organization   another bill and hillary back deal we're   living through the greatest jobs theft   in the history of the world that's what   it is the greatest jobs theft our jobs   are being taken out of our country and   they're going to other countries all   over the world we don't make anything   anymore on a relative basis we're going   to change that around we're going to   start making things again and it's going   to happen fast   [Applause]   a trump administration is going to   renegotiate NAFTA stand up to foreign   cheating and stop the jobs from leaving   our country we're going to start making   things in America you're going to be so   proud of it as part of our plan to bring   back our jobs we're going to lower our   business tax from thirty-five percent to   fifteen percent and our businesses will   start humming again   we're also going to rebuild our inner   cities for years and years and years   you've heard about this from the   Democrats they get the votes they don't   do a thing african-americans and   Hispanics living in the inner cities are   suffering the violence is unbearable you   walk to the store with your child and   you get shot there's no education   there's no jobs there's no safety nearly   3,500 people have been shot in Chicago   since the beginning of the year think of   that since January 3,500 people have   been shot that's as bad as and worse   than some of the war zones you're   reading about in the Middle East   homicides are up nearly fifty percent in   Washington DC and more than sixty   percent in Baltimore and it's getting   worse to the african-american and   Hispanic voters I say what do you have   to lose vote for Donald Trump I will fix   it it can't get worse I will fix it we   will be a rich nation once again but to   be the country and to be a country of   wealth we must also be a safe country   national security begins at the border   speaking in secret to a foreign bank   Hillary Clinton said her dream is for a   totally open trade there go your   businesses and open borders there goes   your country you lose your businesses in   your country anyone who supports open   borders can never be the president of   the United States you will not have a   country left   open borders would be the end of the   United States believe me as we know it   Hillary's plan includes an open border   with the Middle East meaning generations   of radicalism and terrorism spreading   and growing within our shores so let me   state this as clearly as I can if I'm   elected president of the United States I   am going to keep radical Islamic   terrorists the hell out of our country   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   we will also stop the crisis of illegal   immigration a trump administration will   secure and defend our borders and yes we   will build a wall and we will stop drugs   from pouring into our country   [Music]   we have the first-ever endorsement from   ice and our Border Patrol officers first   time they've ever endorsed the   presidential candidate and they're great   people they want to do their job they're   not being allowed to do their job as   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   allowed thousands of thousands I mean   all over thousands of criminal aliens to   be released because their home countries   wouldn't take them back think of it it   was just reported that a man deported   from our country ten times in six years   has been charged with raping a   twelve-year-old girl in August Texas   police arrested a serial illegal   immigrant rapist who had been deported   five times his victims included 1 68   year-old woman with a cane who took his   offer to have a drive to her home he   left her on the side of a dirt road in   horrible horrible condition a 64-year   old Air Force veteran Marilyn Ferris was   raped and beaten to death with a hammer   by a repeat offending criminal illegal   immigrant who should have been deported   under the Obama and administration but   never was should have been deported but   never was what kind of a government   allows its citizen and its citizens to   suffer like this and believe me there is   tremendous suffering going on we have   people from the remembrance project here   and you just have to look at remembrance   project these are amazing people these   are amazing people amazing people so   many so many and it's growing so fast   and that's a bad thing that's a bad   thing either we win this election or we   lose our country as we know it today a   victory in November will be a victory   for you the American people   [Music]   in closing here are some of the amazing   things we're going to do for our country   starting in 2017 we are going to have I   love you too   [Applause]   he sounds like a rough guy but I love   him whoever he is we are going to have   the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan   even bigger will eliminate every   unnecessary job-killing regulation we   will defend religious liberty we're   going to provide school choice every   low-income child in America and we are   going to end common core and bring   education local we will support the men   and women of law enforcement   we're going to rebuild our depleted   military and take care of our wonderful   wonderful veterans who have not been   properly taken care of   [Music]   we're going to save the Second Amendment

Donald J   people this is a lot of people so that   gentleman has real bravery the recipient   of the Congressional Medal of Honor   that's great stuff thank you very much   so it's great thank you in 14 days we   are going to win the state of Florida   and we are going to win back the White   House early voting in Florida is   underway so make sure you get out and   vote we have a thing going on that   they've never seen before it's a   movement they've never seen anything   like it before we're going to win and   we're going to bring back a lot of good   things including common sense to the   White House seventy-five percent of the   american people think at our country is   on the wrong track we have no doubt   about that we are going to fix it we are   going to get our country right back on   the right track together we're going to   deliver real change that puts America   first America first we haven't heard   that term in a long time right we don't   put America first anymore we're going to   start starting next year as soon as we   take office it's America first again   that begins with immediately repealing   and replacing Obamacare   [Applause]   as you know it's just been announced   that Americans are going to experience   another massive double-digit spike in   Obamacare premiums including more than a   one hundred percent increase in the   great state of Arizona they're going up   over a hundred percent think of it and   everybody is going to be going up like   that they gave a number of twenty-five   percent average they know that's not   true they wanted to try and get out of   you know get in front they know that's   not true it's much more you're going to   have sixty seventy eighty ninety percent   increases in Obamacare we're going to   repeal it and we're going to replace it   and we're going to get you great great   health care and a fraction of the cost   one in five Americans trapped and   Obamacare will have only a single   insurer to choose from lot's of luck in   that negotiation even Bill Clinton   admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing   I've ever seen in the world where people   wanted up paying their premiums doubled   and their coverage is cut into half well   you know what he's right but he suffered   that night Garrity the Democrat governor   of Minnesota said the Affordable Care   Act is no longer affordable insurers are   leaving companies are fleeing jobs are   being lost wages are being slashed its   killing our businesses it's killing our   small businesses it's killing   individuals and it's no good deductable   czar so high you can't use it you'll   never get to use it job-killing   Obamacare is just one more way that our   system is rigged believe me remember   Jonathan Gruber of MIT the architect of   Obamacare he said they could pass   Obamacare because the stupidity of the   American voter the stupidity he called   the America   converters stupid the only stupidity   with the stupidity and you know that and   it is the stupidity of our politicians   who rammed this monster down our throats   and I'll tell you from the beginning I   was against it from the beginning I said   it wasn't going to work and it didn't   work it didn't work and it's going to   get worse and Hillary Clinton wants to   keep it she wants to spend a fortune on   it she wants to keep it and your numbers   are going to get up up up and it's going   to get worse worse worse repeal it and   replace it this morning I spent some   time with the incredible employees at   Trump national in doral in Miami which   we own I'm proud of the fact that employ   thousands and thousands of people all   over Florida and the state is an amazing   state but I'm also proud to provide them   with benefits including health care   unfortunately a small number of the   people that work at Trump national in   doral which is Miami their own Obamacare   small percentage and as I said this   morning they are having tremendous   difficulty in fact a lot of them have   said can you take me off Obamacare see   what we should do it or not sure take   them off maybe I well I'll mention you   folks what I do it now but it's a small   group but it's a group that's having   tremendous problems with Obamacare   because of what's going on with the   premiums and what's going on with the   deductibles again they can't use it but   we're going to get these people help   we're going to get the people of the   country help we are going to start   replacing it we are going to have a   great health care system in the United   States and a system that you can afford   so remember if you vote for Hillary   Clinton she wants to double down on   Obamacare   and make it even more expensive and   worse repealing Obamacare   she should be locked up daddy right now   but she's done what she's done going to   be ashamed of herself and you know what   our government ought to be ashamed of   itself for allowing it to happen   repealing Obamacare and stopping   Hillary's health care takeover is one of   the single most important reasons we   must win on November rain we have the   power in our hands in just 14 days 14   days can you believe this i started or   was a year and a half now we're down to   14 days   well I'm unbelievably tough nasty   primers we're proud to say they were the   most difficult and toughest primers they   say in the history of politics so we end   up and now we have a nasty nasty   election but we have the facts on our   side we're going to bring back jobs   we're going to get rid of Obamacare we   have so many facts that we're going to   cut your taxes she's going to raise your   taxes we're going to cut your taxes   we're going to save Social Security   she's going to cut your Social Security   she's going to cut your Social Security   and your Medicare we have the power to   deliver justice for every American who   has been victimized by rising crime and   for every worker whose job has been   shipped to another country and for every   child trapped in a failing failing   horrible government school we had the   power to rebuild the inner cities   betrayed by Hillary Clinton and the   Democrats in Washington african-american   community has been betrayed they've been   betrayed and we're going to get   tremendous african-american votes and   we're going to get tremendous Hispanic   votes these communities have been   betrayed we have a chance to deliver   justice for every taxpayer tired of   watching their money being wasted in   Washington and for every single look   look you know the story every single   voter every single voter what has   happened to our country who wants to fix   a rigged system that takes your jobs   takes your freedom and take your voice   away from you   but together we will defeat the rigged   system and the corrupt media there is   nothing more corrupt than those people   not all of them   [Music]   they are a corrupt group I'll tell you   what I went to the last rally we had   thousands and thousands of people and I   was watching one of these terrible   peoples here and I was watching and it   was saying while the crowd isn't   expected to be big we had an airport   hangar that they couldn't use because it   was a massive hanger but the crowd was   so much bigger we just moved him out   into the runways we had some crowd and   look at this and we always have and by   the way all over the country we have and   you see what's going on you see what's   happening at the voting booth you see   what's happening the lines of three   blocks long I can't tell you exactly but   I see a lot of Trump buttons a lot of   Trump hats a lot of shirts and we have a   feeling don't we that they're going to   be voting for Trump I have a feeling   and i have to tell you we didn't need to   do this i didn't need to do this i was   on the other side you know we took I   took about the other side who knows the   other side better than me I was on the   other side I also knew because i saw was   happening i love our country i love this   country and I had no choice and I jump   so I was an insider and the day I   announced the boy did I become an   outside of Wow amazing I became an   outsider and I love it because we're   leading a movement the likes of which   has never ever been seen in this country   there's never been a moment like this   even the pundits that hate me they say   there has never been an event like this   in the history of our country and we   have to close it out on november eighth   and in your case florida you could go   tomorrow and do you think but you have   to close it out otherwise to me it's a   waste of time energy money thank you you   know I tell the story about one of the   pundits not a good guy but that's okay   he said it doesn't matter whether you   want to lose what you've done has never   been done in politics has never been   anything like this he said it doesn't   matter I said wait a minute wait a   minute it totally matters and I said if   I don't win it will be a great waste   seriously of time energy and money just   a waste just a waste so november eighth   we have to win it's one of the great   movements of all time let's close it out   let's knock out crooked Hillary Clinton   rookin is a three-dollar bill she is as   crooked as a three-dollar bill   real James begins with ridding   Washington of corruption Hillary Clinton   bleats and delete 33,000 emails lied to   Congress under oath made 13 phones   disappear some with a hammer and then   told the FBI she couldn't remember 39   separate times she couldn't remember you   know memories a little bit all   we've also just learned that one of the   closest people to crooked Hillary with   long-standing ties to her and her   husband gave listen to this one folks   you know we wonder how did she get away   with this crime when a four-star general   james Cartwright four-star one of the   most respected men in the military lied   to the FBI once he said he did it for   national security purposes that I can   understand that he lied one time to the   FBI and now they're going to put him in   prison perhaps for five years just   happened yesterday so listen to this so   gay essentially it's Hillary because the   closest person in the world to hillary   and bill is this person they gave more   than six hundred and seventy five   thousand dollars to the campaign of the   wife of the top official in the FBI who   oversaw the investigation into crooked   Hillary's illegal email server so think   of this I don't think this is you   couldn't do a movie like this nobody   would believe it would not people so the   FBI is investment I have such great   respect for the people the FBI they must   be going crazy watching what's happening   at the top they must be gone these are   great people so think of this so the   head of the FBI who's investigating her   has a wife who wants to run for some   office and they give her not a thousand   not two thousand not twenty thirty six   hundred and seventy five thousand   dollars that's big money I speak money   that's big money which was a big   percentage of the money she raised   675,000 else to run for office now this   is the man that is leading the   investigation into her his wife gets six   hundred and seventy-five thousand   dollars   essentially from Hillary Clinton folks   what's going on here what's going on our   country is rigged it's crooked and it's   broken I'm telling you what's going on   the criminal conduct of Hillary Clinton   threatens the foundations of our   democracy and it really does but we're   going to turn it around we're going to   turn it around we're going to turn it   around a new day begins for America and   it starts on November it get out and   vote I proposed the contract with the   American voter that will give government   back to the people so it's supposed to   be my contract begins with a plan to end   the rampant government corruption that's   all over the place I want everyone in   Washington to listen closely to the   message I am delivering on your behalf I   want all of the special interests who   are used to getting their way I fully   understand that to pay very close   attention I want the entire corrupt   establishment to hear and heed the words   we are all about to say if we win on   november eight we are going to   Washington DC and we are going to do   what drain the swamp it is so corrupt   so corrupt but have we ever seen   corruption like this 675,000 have we   ever seen you know I kept saying how did   she get away with this she got a   subpoena from the United States Congress   and after not before that would have   been bad but after getting the subpoena   she deleted thirty-three thousand emails   so she gets a subpoena from this   tremendously high authority she says   artists as bad news get rid of all the   emails by the way boxes of information   and emails two weeks ago we're also just   found to be missing you heard that right   how we see entitled to run for the   office of President and by the way this   is part of the rigged system the   system's rigged folks under my contract   with the American voter we're proposing   a series of ethics reforms on day one to   end government control right right to   end government corruption and those who   violate the law will be brought to   justice there will no longer be two sets   of rules in America I mean look at   general Cartwright look at general   Petraeus's life was destroyed for doing   nothing by comparison to what this   crooked person did at the very core of   my contract is the plan to bring back   American jobs we're bringing a bat we're   going to stop the jobs from leaving our   country we're going to start making   things again in America Apple will start   building factories and plants in this   country and will make their products in   the United States instead of China   Vietnam and all sorts of other countries   [Applause]   right now we are living through the   single greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world that's what's   happening the moving to Mexico it's a   highway one lane right into Mexico they   get our jobs our factories are plants   they get our people they get everything   they get the cash i would say they get   the cash we get the drugs and we get the   unemployment not going to happen not   going to happen oh we will build a wall   don't worry about that will build a wall   will go the wall   that's not even close and by the way I   met with the President of Mexico two   months ago he was wonderful guy   wonderful guy will have no trouble they   can't understand how they get away you   know we have a massive trade deficit   massive with Mexico a massive trade   deficit and when people say oh well   they'll never pay for the well of course   they will because they makin so much   money they make it at the border they   make it every way because the   politicians are sharper and shrewder   than our politicians you know I went to   an Ivy League school I was a good   student and you know what there's no   better word to describe it's a horrible   word to use it's not terrible but you   know I hate to use it but there's no   better word our leaders are stupid   people they're stupid people felony   Obama all this guy does his campaign for   Hillary who we can't stand and if you   read what happened today with the server   back and forth that he ended up knowing   about even though he said he didn't it   just came out on Wikileaks he knew about   it and if you see now why you know I'm   trying to figure out why is he backing   her over Biden did you see where Biden   wants to take me to the back of the barn   me he wants I'd love that I'd love that   mr. tough guy you know he's missed a   tough guy you know when he's missed a   tough guy when he's standing behind a   microphone by himself that's when he   said he wants to bring me to the back of   the barn Oh some things in life you   could really love doing our nation has   lost and by the way if I said that   they'd say he's violent how could he   have done that how could it did you see   what happened the other day it came out   that our rallies we have the greatest   rallies the safest rallies the greatest   people is there ever a better place to   be   but we had some rallies that were rough   well we had some bad people and I'd say   there were bad people in the you know   the dishonest media would never say that   it came out that they paid thugs thugs   to go to our rallies and beat people up   and they gave them fifteen hundred   dollars a day and an iphone here's the   good news not so easy to beat our people   up they found that out it's actually a   painful experience painful experience   but they paid 1500 hours and the media   doesn't report that they didn't   apologize to me they would say Donald   Trump's rallies are out of control they   were putting people in our rallies to   beat people up policemen with bad gashes   on the head walking out your son in   Chicago walking out with blood pouring   out of the head these people were paid   to do that they should be in prison   these people and the people that   organized it that's organized violence   that's real violence and you know what   nothing would happen can you imagine if   we did it and one other thing crooked   Hillary was given the questions to a   debate right you saw that donna Brazile   got the questions and gave them to   Hillary Clinton now what Donna Brazile   did was very dishonest and she should   resign as the head of the DNC she series   on what Donna Brazile did was very up   design but did anyone hear Hillary say   listen I got the questions to the debate   with Bernie Sanders I got the questions   to the debate I feel very uncomfortable   I know it's wrong maybe I'd like not to   have that particular question would that   have been nice but she's crooked Hillary   so the chances of that happening are   zero clubs are zero and you don't hear   about that did anybody hear the story   she got the I wonder if she got the   answers and the questions to the debate   I just had because we beat her very   easily she was beaten   and I'll tell you what did you see her   after the debate she was exhausted she   are you talking about low energy i know   some low energy people but she's right   in there our nation has lost one third   of its manufacturing since NAFTA a deal   signed by Bill Clinton and supported   strongly by Hillary Clinton we've lost   listen to this you won't even believe   this and I've said for two weeks when i   saw this number it's a type of it's got   to be a type of we have lost as a   country seventy thousand factories since   china entered the World Trade   Organization a bill and hillary back   disaster seven listen folks seventy   thousand factories you wouldn't think   that's even possible I thought it was   7,000 or 700 I said you made a mistake   it's 70,000 under my contract we will   immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA   and if we don't get the deal we want we   will terminate NAFTA and get a much   better deal for our workers and our   company it's going to be America first   the next disaster on the horizon is the   trans-pacific partnership a nearly 6,000   page document that will drain our jobs   and our freedoms it will be another   disaster you cannot let it happen if I'm   president it's not happening folks and   we're gonna have a lot of trade but   we're not going to make these many multi   nations if we're gonna have one on one   on one on one we're going to have   straight lines going right into   different countries and you know what if   they misbehave if they do something bad   it's called a 30-day notice of   cancellation and you know what during   that 30 days they'll come back and we'll   make a better deal a trumpet   administration will stop the   trans-pacific partnership Hillary   Clinton called the TPP the gold standard   and would approve one hundred percent of   it now during the debate she said she   never called that the goal said it right   but she lied   she lied and during the debate when I   said line in the sand right the red line   that our great president said draw the   line in the sand right well she said she   wasn't Secretary of State she lied she   was she was that came up in the next   debate by the way you lied about this   all I'm sorry admitted she doesn't mean   we won't let it happen because we will   win a november eighth and we will   protect every last american and every   last american job if we don't stop the   TPP we will lose our economic   independence for good it's a big big   problem that's what's at stake in this   election this election has so many   things going number one lower taxes less   regulation and we get rid of obamacare   and we come up with a plan that's so   much less expensive   so what we're going to do are a few   things the tax reduction will give a   middle-class family with two children a   basic break of thirty-five percent   families will be able to fully deduct   the cost of child care for their taxes   we will lower taxes on our businesses   from thirty-five percent all the way   down to fifteen percent we will become a   jobs generating machine we will be so   proud of our country again we're not   going to lose our businesses and if they   decide to go and they want to make their   air conditioning unit they want to make   their car they want to send it through   the border which now will become a very   strong border guess what folks   thirty-five percent tax they're never   going to leave they're never going to   leave we will be a rich nation again but   to be a rich country we must also be a   safe country that's why my contract   includes major investments in federal   law enforcement efforts to dismantle   criminal networks preying on our   citizens and that's what they're doing I   will also keep us safe from radical   Islamic right radical Islamic terrorists   radical Islamic terrorists Hillary   Clinton unleash dices and unleash death   and suffering across the Middle East and   spreading into our country we are taking   thousands and thousands of people from   Syria we have no idea where they come   from we have no idea who they are   they're not properly vetted you will see   over the years what a mistake that is   you will see she wants to now increase   the high number already were taking in   thousands tens of thousands she wants to   increase that number by five hundred and   fifty percent you put her in his press   that you're crazy now that she wants in   her words totally open borders that goes   your country because you can trade which   includes an open border with the Middle   East she wants to allow people to   pouring the Hillary plan would transform   our country and leave us with   generations of terrorism inside our   shores a trump administration is going   to suspend immigration from terror prone   regions and will suspend the Syrian   refugee program immediately we have no   choice we have no choice let me state   this as clearly as I can if I'm elected   president I am going to keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of our   country we have enough problems we have   enough problem   i will also secure and defend the   borders of the united states and yes we   will build the wall we will build the   wall it is so necessary and we will   cancel all funding for sanctuary cities   [Applause]   thousands of

rcI4YvDSAAs~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160929~Full Event: Donald Trump Rally in Bedford, New Hampshire (9/29/2016) Trump Bedford NH Speech~26770.0~4.76151752472~694.0~44.0~   we we have challenges all over this   country right now all over this country   we have homeland security challenges we   have jobs that are desperately needed   from here all the way across this   country we have all sorts of issues that   we're dealing with as well as all these   things that are going on overseas and in   many cases there's so much failure from   the frankly from the Obama   administration and the Hillary Clinton   time as the Secretary of State and just   watching that I I am like sick to my   stomach sometimes when I see what it is   that that we are doing to ourselves   around the world we should be still that   light on the top of the hill that's   shining bright where everybody comes to   it and says that's the America that I   know that's the America that I love and   that's the America that Donald Trump is   going to reignite again okay so so for   the real treat what you've been waiting   to do here ladies and gentlemen I want   to introduce the next president of the   United States of America Donald Trump   [Applause]   wow this is a wonderful   this is beautiful a lot of people coming   in from outside so they'll just come in   should we wait should we win we'll start   right okay it's great to be back in New   Hampshire really this is a state a   special place you know this is where I   had my first victory we do know that   right right such a word I mean it's a   special place it really is and you know   what really amazed me when I came here   and I got to know so many people so many   are in the room so many great friends   and they said the biggest single problem   they have up here is heroin and I said   how does heroin work with these   beautiful lakes and trees and all of the   beautiful it doesn't but it's the single   biggest problem and I said that if I win   I get the nomination and I win we're   going to build that wall and we're going   to stop that heroin from pouring in and   we're going to stop the poison of the   youth we're going to build the wall   believe me we are going to build the   wall but we're going to stop the poison   from pouring in and destroying our youth   and plenty of other people and we're   going to work on those people that got   addicted and are addicted and i'll tell   you what we're going to do a real job   for the state of New Hampshire and I owe   something very special because again   this was my first victory and this is   where it all started so remember look at   how many people are here look at look at   what happened recently Hillary Clinton   Bernie Sanders had very few people at   their rally yesterday   and that's because they don't like   Hillary and Bernie sold out to the devil   you know at Bernie if Bernie had made   his deal and just done something where   maybe he did nothing and just went away   he would have been a legendary character   it would have been a legendary political   figure but the deal he made with hillary   was not the right thing and it wasn't   representative of what he should have   done to his people and we're gonna have   a lot of Bernie's people supporting us   especially because of my views on trade   we're gonna have a lot of Bernie people   but he should never have made the deal   and I'll bet you he wished he didn't   make that deal that was not the right   deal for him to make the people of New   Hampshire and everywhere else don't care   about Bernie anymore because now they   look into the future and the future is   going to be something special I love the   people of New Hampshire and we're going   to fulfill every single wish every   single promise we're going to do   something very very significant for you   you're strong you're independent and you   are free we're going to work very hard   together over the next 40 days can you   believe it 40 days this started june   sixteenth in New York City and here we   are and we're going to win this state   we're going to win back the White House   we're going to make America great again   we're going to take on the special   interest the lobbyists and the corrupt   corporate media that have rigged the   system against everyday Americans and   they've rigged it for a long time we're   going to create millions of new jobs and   we really need them we need jobs people   have given up looking for jobs we're   going to create trillions of dollars in   new wealth for our communities and   rising wages for every worker in   American we're going to create a new   government that serves you your family   and your country we're going to end the   Clinton corruption and restore   [Applause]   I mean did you see what happened   yesterday did you see what happened   yesterday with the director of the FBI   talking about the emails I don't think   I've ever seen a thing like that it's an   embarrassment I don't think I've ever   seen a thing like that in my life and it   really is a sad it was a sad sad   honestly it's a sad time for the United   States it's a very very sad time and   yesterday was a sad a very sad day let's   see what happens I think I actually   believe because of what happened   yesterday I think that whole thing has a   long way to go so we're going to see   what happens hillie right I mean is it   incredible Hillary Clinton is an insider   fighting only for herself and for her   donors I'm an outsider fighting for you   everything everything you need to know   about Hillary Clinton sometimes referred   to as crooked Hillary can be understood   with is simple but very important phrase   follow the money the large corporations   who support terrible trade deals   offshore jobs they take these jobs they   offshore the jobs they're donating to   Hillary Clinton it's called follow the   money The Wall Street investors who have   rigged the regulations against the   middle class they're donating to Hillary   Clinton follow the money the wealthy   donors who want to shut down American   energy they're donating to Hillary   Clinton follow the money the special   interest who want to open borders are   donating to Hillary Clinton again just   follow the money in her campaign for   president Hillary Clinton has received   100 million dollars in contributions   from Wall Street and hedge funds she and   Bill were paid 150   in dollars for speeches since bill left   the Oval Office and she doesn't speak   well figure that one in fact they had a   very small group of people was she here   yesterday very small crowd very very sad   hundred million dollars i don't think so   folks what's going on the same groups   paying bill and hillary for their   speeches were lobbying the federal   government 22 groups paying bill clinton   for speeches lobbied the State   Department while Hillary Clinton was   Secretary of State favors and access   were granted to those who wrote checks   she put the office of Secretary of State   up for sale and if she ever got the   chance she put the Oval Office up for   sale too she deleted and bleached 33   thousand emails after a congressional   subpoena was issued after think of it   after she gets a subpoena she gets a   subpoena she sees the subpoena she then   gets rid of 33,000 emails on top of a   lot of other things if you did that in   your civilian life you would have   problems for the rest of your life   thirteen phones missing several   destroyed with a hammer who in this room   has destroyed their phone with a hammer   anybody anybody oh there's one person   what business is that person and I want   to find   yeah well Benghazi is a horrible thing   you saw what happened about taking the   Fifth Amendment and her ringleaders   getting immunity deals will call them   really the FBI immunity five nobody's   ever seen they gave so much immunity   there was nobody left to talk to there   was nobody left except Hillary they   probably gave her immunity to do you   think Hillary got him yeah she got the   humidity she had something you know when   you think of it she did so much worse   than anybody else people that did a tiny   fraction of what she did their lives   have been destroyed and here she is   running for president it's a dishonestly   it's a disgrace foreign enemies with   easy access to hacker server and they   did lies to Congress under oath about   turning over her work-related emails   remember she said on her emails it was   about yoga classes and it was about a   wedding 33,000 yoga wedding she under   financial backers will say anything do   anything lie about anything to keep   their grip on power to keep their   control over this country the American   people have had it with years and   decades of Clinton corruption and   scandals corruption and scandal   and impeachment for lying impeachment   for line remember that impeach they're   tired of the lies they're tired of the   trivial politics they're tired of being   talked down to look down upon and   treated like second-class citizens and   they're phenomenal people you are   phenomenal people the Clintons are the   sordid past we will be the very bright   and clean future while our campaign   outlines big changes in bold solutions   to make your life better the Clinton   campaign focuses only on small and petty   distractions this will be the year the   American people say finally enough is   enough it's going to start with New   Hampshire   Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for   so many communities but especially for   african-american communities I don't   think african-americans are going to   come out and vote for Clinton they're   too smart and they know they are just   being used by her and her campaign they   also know that she'll do nothing for   them once the election is over she never   does and that will never ever change   many of them will never forget her   calling young african-american men super   predators not nice same thing goes for   Hispanic voters and they are tired of   being used by people like Hillary   Clinton that have no intention of doing   anything for them once the election is   over a trump administration will bring   prosperity to all of the people of our   great country you're bringing prosperity   look at what happened to your jobs look   at what happened to your jobs look at   what happened to all of those companies   that left and went to Mexico and other   places and you are probably the number   one group of people that were affected   if you think about it in the whole   country my economic agenda can be summed   up with three very beautiful words jobs   jobs jobs we're going to pass the   biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and   we're going to lower try and remember   she's raising taxes substantially and   we're going to lower the business rate   from thirty five percent all the way   down to fifteen percent making America   into a magnet for new jobs and growth   every wasteful and unnecessary   regulation will be eliminated along with   every illegal executive order we will   unleash the power of American energy   we're going and we're sitting right now   sitting on 50 trillion dollars of   untapped energy reserves and we're going   to put that wealth into the pockets of   the American people and we're going to   start reducing debt common core will be   ended and disadvantaged and   disadvantaged children will be allowed   to attend the school of their choice   choice big word choice very important   word the catastrophe known as Obamacare   will be repealed and replaced and it's   dying of its own volition anyway you see   what's happening it's dying and the   disastrous trade deals like NAFTA that   have caused so much pain in New   Hampshire will be renegotiated and I   mean renegotiated for your benefit not   to the benefit of Mexico we're going to   either change it Oh we'll start all over   again folks and it'll be a big big   difference believe me now after was   signed by Bill Clinton and supported by   crooked Hillary and your state has lost   one in three manufacturing jobs since it   was approved it's a catastrophe it's the   worst trade deal ever negotiated and   ever made not only in the United States   probably anywhere in the world there's   never been a deal like this you've lost   one in four jobs think of it since China   entered the World Trade Organization so   you lost one in four this is another   deal with the Clintons and Hillary   Clinton has been on the wrong side of   every major trade deal in a career and   if she gets the chance and this is a   hundred percent she would approve the   trans-pacific partnership which would   destroy so much more   of your manufacturing in this state   hillary clinton is merely a vessel for   the special interest trying to strip   this country of its wealth its jobs and   its status as a sovereign nation   remember she called TPP the gold   standard and then during the debate the   other night where every single online   poll said we want which is great every   single online poll and during the debate   the other night she was saying oh no she   never said that she said it I mean she   said it and then I had to put up then I   had to put up with the anchor and fight   the anchor all the time when everything   I said what a rig deal let's say we're   in such a rig it is terrible what's   going on in this country is so sad but   it will change remember november eight   November a she called it the gold   standard the gold standard for   destroying wealth and jobs she's a   globalist who has made a career of   taking jobs from our country and giving   them to other countries I'm not running   to be President of the world I'm running   to be President of the United States of   America and we're going to do a great   job from now on it's going to be America   first America first   have you ever wondered why it's that all   things that the American people want   they never seem to happen things they   want just don't happen just think about   it for how many years have the American   people ask for a tax code to be fixed or   for infrastructure to be repaired we've   been talking about this for years or for   the waste to be removed from our budget   for many years and how many have voters   pleaded for secure borders fair trade   deals just fair deals we're going to   make great deals by the way we're going   to make great deals but just fair deals   and quality schools that serve parents   and students all the things you've ever   wanted for your country have been denied   they've been denied the reason is very   simple it's because the financial   interests who control our politics in   our media don't want these changes to   happen these special interest control   totally Hillary Clinton look at the   money somebody said she's spending on   commercials in certain areas fifty to   one and we're tied or I'm leading how do   you do that 50 thank you it fifty   commercials to everyone i'm putting up   and we're tied and i'm even leading in   some of these areas she's their chosen   representative she's been there for 30   years and has never done anything for   you or your family she's there for only   one reason to protect her donors and   collect their money our campaign is   taking on big business big media and big   donors we're taking them on for you   that's what we're doing I didn't need to   do this believe me I built a great great   company I didn't need to do this we're   going to straighten it out   we want you to have the future that you   want and that you deserve that includes   very importantly keeping your family   safe new FBI statistics just out show   that homicide rose fifteen percent last   year in America's large cities and that   it's the biggest single year increase in   45 years you don't hear these numbers   right nobody tells you more than 3,000   people have been shot in Chicago since   January there was in a long time ago   3,000 people that's say it again yes we   could he goes yes we can oh boy   that can only happen in New Hampshire   right by to fail politicians and the   arrogant media don't want me to talk   about the crime and the violence that's   happening in this country they just want   me to go along with the status quo well   I have news for the people trying to   silence me and you and trying to silence   all of us we will never back down we we   we will never back down from fighting we   are going to save American lives and   we're going to turn this whole big ship   around and it's going to be turned   around quickly that also means keeping   our nation safe from radical Islamic   terrorism   Hillary Clinton doesn't say the words   and certainly President Obama will never   say the words we're also going to keep   our country safe from drugs New   Hampshire has suffered so greatly from   the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring   across the border the rate of heroin   overdose has nearly quadrupled in the   state once again our politicians have   tragically failed this country and its   people and especially more than anyplace   this state I've never seen anything like   it with what's happening with the drugs   more so than other places and other   places are a disaster but we're going to   turn it around we're going to turn it   around for New Hampshire I'm going to   stop the drugs from pouring across the   border and that is a promise the people   getting rich off the rig system of the   people throwing their money at Hillary   Clinton our campaign is about breaking   up the special interest monopoly in   Washington DC we're trying to disrupt   the collusion between the wealthy donors   the large corporations and the media   executives who are among the most honest   people anywhere that I have met they're   all part of the same corrupt political   establishment and they not along when   Hillary Clinton slanders you as   deplorable and irredeemable   [Applause]   you don't look deplorable to me and you   don't look irredeemable I call you   hard-working American patriots and   together we're going to save our country   together we can accomplish anything we   want we have a movement going on it's a   movement like they've never seen in this   country some of the great pundits have   said and they've saved often some of the   pundits that don't even like me say it's   a single greatest political phenomena   they've ever seen we had in Florida the   other night we had 25,000 people no   matter where we go we have rooms that   are packed with unbelievable americans   and i'll tell you what come november   eighth i think the world is going to see   something that's really going to be   special but that means you have to show   up and vote so if you're sick you're not   feeling well it's like you just don't   think you're even gonna make it and the   doctor comes in he looks at you and he   says you're right you're not gonna make   it we don't care right you have to get   out of bed and you have to vote   you have to knock on doors you have to   pick up that phone you have to campaign   on the street spread the love that we   have in this room to the people of our   country we're going to bring our system   together we're going to bring in our   country together we're going to have   unity we're a divided nation in so many   different ways we r divided nation just   turn on your televisions at night and   you'll see what a divided nation we are   and there's no reason for it to beat the   system I will fix it to beat the system   you have to lift up your voice pound the   pavement and get out that vote visit our   website I always hate saying that   because it sounds so like boring but   that's the latest visit our website give   40 days until the election you have 40   days to make every dream you ever dream   for your country come true do not let   this opportunity slip away I don't   believe we're ever going to have this   opportunity again this is it this is it   you're never going to have this   opportunity again you have one   magnificent chance to deliver justice   for every forgotten man woman and child   in this nation there are many the   arrogance of Washington DC will soon   come face to face with the righteous   verdict of the American voter or   November right you know that you know it   on november eighth we're going to show   the whole world that America is back   bigger and bigger how you know that   right you know you

  to add more regulation we're going to   repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare   we're going to make child care more   affordable and available to the families   and to the mothers we need help   childcare something that my daughter   Ivanka feels very strongly about so do I   we're going to bring back our   manufacturing jobs which have been   ripped away from us by incompetent   politicians we're going to keep radical   Islamic terrorists out of our country   did you see the other day where they   were going to deport 800 people and they   made a slight mistake instead of   deporting these 800 people they made the   800 people citizens of the United States   and then when I said well that's okay   you can change it around can't you if   you made a mistake and they said that   might not be constitutional can you   believe this what's going on and the   mistake also was they think it wasn't   really 800 people was 1800 people this   is like the 400 million in cash that we   gave to Iran 400 is in cash we gave it   to Iran as part of one of the worst   deals I've ever seen in the history of   in my life I've never seen anything like   it but as part we gave 400 million in   cash but that turned out to be wrong   also it was 1.7 billion in cash you know   at one point seven billion in cash is I   think would be starting around here we   go up to the ceiling who can authorize   this who would be so stupid to authorize   that   you're right we're going to save the   Second Amendment which is under siege we   are going to support the men and women   of law

Clinton's   illegal email server   [Applause]   so the man that was investigating her   from the FBI his wife runs for office   and they give her more than six hundred   and seventy-five thousand dollars to run   and it just came out they just figured   it out   we've never had a thing like this in the   history of this country this represented   a large portion of the money the FBI   official spouse had for the entire   campaign a big big percentage it's   absolutely disgraceful it's absolutely   terrible and it's unbelievable how   Hillary Clinton got away with the email   I the email scam the email corruption   but now at least we have a pretty good   idea and general Cartwright a four-time   of four thickeners a four-star general   highly respected just at the end of last   week struck a deal he lied one time to   the FBI and he said he did that for   national security reasons highly   respected man four-star we're talking   about a four-star general and he's going   to go to jail perhaps for as much as   five years and that's a tiny fraction   that's a tiny fraction of what Hillary   Clinton did so the fact that she is even   allowed to run means our system is   rigged she never had a chance of being   convicted Hillary knew this money was   being paid and she has to be held   accountable for this yet another crime   one of so many and she has to be held   accountable because she knew that money   675,000 plus was being paid so how is   she allowed to continue to run for   president how is she allowed   [Applause]   she gets the subpoena from the United   States Congress asking for her emails   and other records and she bleaches them   and deletes them now bleaching nobody   ever heard of people sophisticated   people in that world that and the reason   it's so expensive to do it so not only   did they delete them they bleached them   and now two weeks ago they find out that   two boxes of emails are missing and you   don't read about that in the New York   Times and you don't read about that in   the other newspapers because the system   is corrupt the system is broken   the system is corrupt folks and I've   been saying it it's rigged I've been   saying it for a long time the system is   rigged WikiLeaks also shows how John   Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling   Democrats a voter suppression technique   and that's happening to me all the time   when the polls are even when they leave   them alone and do them properly I'm   leading but you see these poles with   their polling Democrats house Trump   doing oh he's down there polling   Democrats the system is corrupt and it's   rigged and it's broken and we're going   to change   thank you in an email Podesta says that   he wants / samples for our polling in   order to maximize what we get out of our   media polling it's called voter   suppression because people was oh gee   Trump said wilt folks we're winning   we're winning we're winning these   thieves and crooks the media not all of   it not all of it but much of it   they're the most crooked they're almost   as crooked as Hillary they may even be   more crooked than Hillary because   without the media she would be nothing   without the media Hillary Clinton would   be nothing   they're disgraceful   [Applause]   just remember that just remember that   without the dishonesty and deceit of the   media Hillary Clinton would be nothing   nothing here's how all of this affects   you when the people who control the   political power in our society can rig   investigations like her investigation   was rigged can rig polls you see these   phony polls and rig the media they can   wield absolute power over your life your   economy and your country and benefit   big-time by it they control what you   hear and what you don't hear what is   covered how it's covered even if it's   covered at all sometimes I'll have like   these great events and it won't be   covered if there's a little glitch its   front-page news all over the world they   can ship your jobs all over the world   let drugs pour into your care look at   the drugs that are pouring into this   area but all over let drugs pour into   your community and let Congress right   loopholes to benefit a select few and   then you always hear Hillary she's gonna   fight Isis well she's been there for a   long time she and Obama through their   own competence and this guy only does   his campaign he got to go back and   trying to get some jobs for our country   all he does is campaign we have an   incompetent president we have a   president that doesn't know what he's   doing and again take a look at Mosul   they announced four months ago three   months ago we're going into Mosul we're   gonna get the leaders of Isis because   they're living in Mosul guess what 12   minutes later the leaders they left   they're not stupid they left whatever   happened remember the great generals was   called the element of surprise   the element of surprise so now we're   bogged down in Mosul the enemy is much   tougher than they thought they've had a   lot of time to get ready they're using   human shields all over the place it's a   horrible horrible situation that's going   on why did we have to tell them we're   going in why didn't we go in and then   tell the public a week later   congratulations we just got the   leadership we didn't lose many people   I'm telling you folks our leadership I   went to an Ivy League school but there's   some words that you can't describe any   better our leadership is stupid these   are stupid people   so bad these are stupid stupid people   and they're leading us right down the   tubes the corrupt system can also force   brave National Guardsmen from California   to return the bonuses they were promised   something that would never happen under   a trump administration how about that   one these people we want your money back   that we gave you years ago this can only   happen with these incompetent people we   have running and people with no common   sense they're incompetent but they have   no common sense they have no common   sense while the median politicians   celebrated Washington DC our inner   cities crumble innocent children are   shot in the street and working families   who just want to raise can't get a break   the media isn't just against me they're   against all of you that's really what   they're against they're not against me   they're against what we represent like   Hillary Clinton they look down on the   hard-working people of the country   that's what's happened the media is   entitled condescending and even   contemptuous of the people who don't   share their elitist views and this is   all for money this is for money largely   money and power I see you and I hear you   I am your voice remember remember   I was on the other side of this equation   for a long time it was very comfortable   it was a very good side but then I   decided that you know i'll tell you the   bottom line i love our country and we   were going bad we were going man   [Applause]   I will never let you be the Forgotten   people again with the Forgotten people I   will never let you down I promise I will   never ever let you down when we win your   voice will boom through the halls of   Washington and will be heard all across   the world this is bigger than brexit   what's going on this is bigger than   bricks   and folks get out and vote leave here   and vote leave here and vote or we have   wasted a hell of a lot of time energy   and in my case a lot of money I'm not a   politician and I never wanted to be a   politician believe me I ran because this   country has been good to me I love   America I could not stand by and watch   what was happening to our great country   I didn't want to do it my only special   interest is you the American people and   we're going to solve the riddle of   what's going on in Washington it's time   to clean up our nation's capital that's   why I proposed the contract with the   American voter it's a set of promises   for what I'll do in my first 100 days it   includes getting rid of immediately   Obamacare which is a disaster   even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is   the craziest thing in the world quote   craziest thing of the world where people   wind up with their premiums doubled and   their coverage cut in half now he may   have had a tough evening when he went   home but that's right and she wants to   make it far worse she wants to double   down she wants to make it bigger it's   going to destroy the American family and   it's destroying American business   especially small business but you know   what else it's not working it's no good   it's terrible health care it's and you   know your numbers are so crazy you   really can't use it your deductibles is   so high you'll never get to use it it's   just one more reason why we have to win   on November my concert   with the American voter begins with a   plan to end the rampant government   corruption and put the special interests   out of business we're going to do it I   understand it I understand it I   understand it very well I want everyone   in Washington to hear and to heed the   words that we all say together if we win   on november eighth we are going to drain   the swamp in washington DC

cases it's not just lack of   intelligence it's not just stupidity in   some cases it's because they're getting   so much money from donors and special   interests that they want to do it they   don't care about our country first I   will announce I love you to my attention   to renegotiate NAFTA   the worst economic trade deal ever   signed in the history of the world also   or withdraw from the

secretary of the   Treasury to label China a currency   manipulator they are they know I have a   great relationship with John I've made a   lot of money with China but you know   what they know they

and I just met with your   great sheriffs and your great law   enforcement people and your firefighters   your first responders these are great   people these are great people first   cancel every unconstitutional executive   action or executive order memorandum   issued by president obama   where are he and Michelle campaigning   today where are they would you rather   see them like in that White House   figuring out how to knock the hell out   of Isis wouldn't you rather have them in   the White House like working hard so   that Mexico stops stealing our companies   and therefore our jobs wouldn't it be   great would it be great if they could   come up with a great health care program   instead of one way your numbers are 70   80 even ninety percent more than there   were just recently you know you have   increases in Obamacare that are going   through the roof it's out of control by   the way just so you understand it's a   dead program it's unaffordable Hilary   wants to throw more money at it to keep   it going it's a dead program and it's   putting our businesses out I'd love to   see him in the White House working   instead of campaigning for crooked   Hillary Clinton happy on   [Applause]   remember what he said Donald Trump will   never win the Republican primary he will   never do that sorry you will never win   the Republicans will never do that well   they did it sorry and what happened we   got the most votes in the history of the   Republican primary system over 14   million were 40 Tuesday's second begin   the process of selecting replacement for   Justice Scalia great man from one of the   20 judges on my list who will uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   States turn cancel all federal funding   to sanctuary cities   how bad is that   thou'rt begin swiftly to remove all   criminal aliens from our country   so we have many illegal immigrants in   our country who are criminals convicted   criminals murderers drug lords gang   members and what happened during Hillary   Clinton's stay during the her Secretary   of State days people would take him out   cuz I'll tell what these border patrol   agent and ice agents they're great   people they want to do the job but   they're not they're told stand back but   these were bad and that bring them back   to their country and very intelligently   because they know who they're dealing   with they say we don't want them they   don't want drug kingpins they don't want   murders and gang members so they'd say   turn around we're not accepting them so   they turn around and then say Madam   Secretary they won't accept them oh   that's okay let's let them out on our   streets and we have that we have that   and I promise you one thing during my   presidency there will not be one   instance where those countries don't   take these people back not one   tips to spend immigration from tara   prone regions we're vetting cannot   safely occur including the suppression   of the syrian refugee program which   hillary clinton wants to expand by five   hundred and fifty percent over the   thousands and thousands of people that   are already coming in we know nothing   about them that'll be the next great   Trojan horse you watch watch what   happens next I'll work with Congress to   introduce the following legislative   measures and fight for their passage   within the first 100 days of my   administration will get a pest middle   class tax relief and simplification act   we're giving you massive tax relief for   the middle class with two children as an   example would get a thirty five percent   tax cut we have to the middle class has   been forgotten in our nation we're going   to end the offshoring act that's what   it's called and the offshoring Act   established tariffs to stop companies   from laying off their workers and   relocating to other countries then   selling their product back into our   country with no tax no consequence no   retribution there'll be a thirty five   percent tax and they'll never leave our   country believe me   American infrastructure act 1 trillion   dollars in public-private infrastructure   investment our infrastructure is going   to hell our roads our highways are   tunnels are bridges you see the report   on the bridges how unsafe so many   bridges i'm going to start swimming   across the river as it likes them i   don't want to drive now I mean   tremendous percentages of bridges are   they say virtually ready to fall fall   down our country think of it Obama has   doubled our national debt to 20 trillion   dollars he's added 10 trillion in just   seven and a half years now here's the   problem here's the problem it would be   one thing if the country was in tippy   top shape the roads are beautiful the   highways are beautiful the tunnels the   schools the hospital how countries our   mess our infrastructure is falling apart   and we owe 20 trillion dollars it takes   this kind of a mind to figure that one   out because it's it's a mess this means   help for projects like the first coast   express would you like the first ghost   expressway school choice and education   Opportunity Act gives parents the right   to send their kids to the school of   their choice choice choice it's great   choice is important and we're going to   end common core and bring education loca   then we have one that at least a few of   you will like it's called the repeal and   replace Obamacare act what ages asked by   the way I just left the farmers West   Palm Beach farmers beautiful farmers   great people and they said that   Obamacare is destroying their business   destroying their business they can't   afford it they don't even know how to   account for it they have to hire   consultants just to fill out forms it's   so complicated it is so down there so   discouraged and the same thing happened   in Iowa the same thing happened in New   Hampshire everywhere I go people are   despondent over it actually worse than   our high taxes worse than our   over-regulation which is killing us also   by the what's killing our businesses   Obamacare is a catastrophe that she   wants to build bigger and stand better   but better means more expensive it's   going to get worse under Hillary Clinton   it's going to get worse and don't forget   she's got a lot of people that gave her   money that want Obamacare to continue   just remember them so fully repeal   Obamacare and replace it with   patient-centered reforms that are   totally affordable and much better so   we'll have better health care at a much   lower price affordable childcare and   Elder Care Act allows Americans to   deduct child care and elder care from   the taxes and creates tax-free dependent   care savings accounts for all american   families and this one I a tribute to   Ivanka Trump has anyone ever heard of   she feels so strongly about it and I   agree and illegal immigration act   thousands of Americans have been killed   by illegal immigrants including   Americans like Josh Wilkerson whose   mother I've got to know during the   campaign an incredible woman who suffers   every day Josh a student in high school   was tortured strangled and beaten to   death by an illegal immigrant and then   his body was set on fire I've also met   Julie and you have to see that the   family of Josh its I said this time make   it better she actually said time in a   certain way makes it worse makes it   worse this was somebody that should have   never been in the country should have   been thrown out of the country and   nobody acted and she I should be alive   we're gonna build the wall don't worry   about it don't worry about don't even   think about it don't even think about   don't even think about it   I've also met and gotten to really like   Julie go luck whose son Spencer was shot   in the head by the illegal immigrants   Spencer had just dropped his girlfriend   off and was driving innocently home one   more life stolen this person should   never have been allowed in our country   should have been removed from our   country they knew he was trouble he   stayed this crime wave ends believe me   quickly when I am president believe me   it ends   [Applause]   Hilary on the other hand is for totally   open borders which would mean the   destruction of our country that's the   end once you have open borders you no   longer have a country folks I hate to   tell you restoring Community Safety Act   empowers federal law enforcement to   dismantle criminal gangs and to deport   or imprison violent criminal offenders   quickly quickly the restoring National   Security Act eliminates the   obama-clinton defense sequester which   has destroyed our military our young   people the greatest in the world are   flying planes that when they need parts   they go to a plane museum or they go to   an airplane graveyard because they don't   even make the parts anymore this is what   we're for this is the United States the   rebuilding of our military will include   major new assets across the state of   Florida including the new Navy and Coast   Guard ships to patrol the Seas and new   aircraft that will fly from MacDill Air   Force Base and naval air station   pensacola we love those people   I think we're getting all of the   military vote and I know we're getting   all of the law enforcement vote get out   and vote clean up corruption in   Washington act and acts new ethics well   is so important because it is a mess it   is the swamp in acts new ethics reforms   to end government corruption but think   about that think about what was on the   front page today of the Wall Street   Journal just think about it think about   it what's happened to our country how   embarrassed the FBI that some of the   greatest people in our country are in   the FBI how embarrassed these people   must be to see what's happened to the   FBI and how dare they take a force are   highly respected general james   Cartwright and destroy him but Hillary   Clinton is allowed to lie over and over   and over again how dare they   with a victory in November everything   will change that change includes   standing in solidarity with the   suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela   against the oppression of the castro and   Maduro regimes true and we will help our   friends in Haiti who've been ripped off   by the Clintons for years to recover and   rebuild and by the way the people of   haiti truly hate the Clintons you know   what's happened there they hate the   twins for eight long years here in   American the conservative movement has   long to reverse the illegal and   unconstitutional conduct of President   Obama on november eighth we can wipe   away the lawless legacy and create a   section unbelievable american future but   you know what we don't have another four   years we're going to either win this or   it's over it'll never

under siege   and appoint justices to the United   States Supreme Court who will uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   States   I will promote life defend religious   liberty and select justices in the bowl   of Justice Scalia   [Applause]   and I was just informed yesterday that   Justice Scalia's wife who I hear is a   great lady has a trump sign on her front   law of that I love them thank you i love   them i will end the wasteful government   spending and hold the bureaucrats   totally accountable I will faithfully   execute the sacred office of commander   in chief and create a new foreign policy   that once again puts America first we   haven't been there in a long time when   I'm president the tide of big government   will no longer threaten to wash away our   dreams our liberties or our freedoms we   must stand united to fulfill America's   dreams and destiny let us be united so   that we can save our country and have a   rebirth of American freedom and

and those two gentlemen are amazing men   and I want to thank them for being with   us you know pueblos called home of the   heroes did you know that because of your   proud tradition of military service   pueblos the home of four medal of honor   recipients and I just got the   endorsement of 19 all together 19 so   when you have 19 that's pretty good but   you have four which is amazing and as   President Eisenhower said there must be   something in the water out here in   Playboy because all of you guys turn out   to be heroes what's going on what's   going on says something in the water   give me some of that water Colorado is   home to six military bases we're going   to eliminate the defense sequester and   rebuild our military we're going to   strengthen it we're going to make it   truly truly strong again another great   Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing   my son's know that very well they're   here all the time we're going to   conserve your land for the future   generations and we're going to save your   second Amendment which is under siege   a lot of people in this room this is   very impressive thank you thank you it's   great honor it's a great honor one other   issue of such great importance in   Colorado is energy crooked Hillary   Clinton wants to shut down the mines and   shut down jail and shut down oil and   natural gas and we're going to end the   war in American energy and we are going   to put the miners back to work they have   to be put back to you I've also made a   centerpiece of my economic   revitalization plan the largest middle   class tax cut since Ronald Reagan and   the largest regulatory reform in   American history we're going to do that   and Hillary Clinton is going to increase   your taxes very very substantially and   she admits it police she admits it   but that's because I know how overtaxed   and over-regulated the working people   and companies in this country are a   central issue I would like to address   today is our broken tax code an issue of   concern to all Americans along with   securing our borders rebuilding our   military keeping us safe from terrorism   redoing our trade deals and bringing   back jobs and they're sort of one of the   same fixing our broken tax code is one   of the main reasons i'm running for   president i've been saying from the   beginning of this campaign how   ridiculous complex and yes unfair the   tax system is it is an unfair system and   so complex that very few people   understand it fortunately I understand   it   [Applause]   this is not the fault of the IRS but the   political class that is owned outright   by the special interests and lobbyists   believe me it's these politicians who   wrote the tax code and who are   constantly adding revising and changing   and already over complicated set of laws   all at the behest of their favorite   donors and special interests who want   certain provisions put in and they won't   take no for an answer it's thousands of   pages long and almost no one understands   it the average American would need an   army of accountants and lawyers to wade   through and wade through it many   so-called experts due to their sheer   size and complexity of the code don't   have a clue what these pages represent   these are experts they get paid and they   don't even know what it represents the   unfairness of the tax laws is   unbelievable it's something I've been   talking about for a long time despite   frankly being a big beneficiary of the   laws but I'm working for you now I'm not   working for Trump   believe me   [Applause]   I understand the tax laws better than   almost anyone which is why I am one who   can truly fix them I understand it I get   it and that is what I commit to do we   want fairness we want money brought in   and we want money to be spent when it   goes out because they spend our tax   dollars so unfairly and unwisely   remember that as a businessman and real   estate developer I have legally used a   tax laws to my benefit add to the   benefit of my company my investors and   my employees I mean honestly I have   brilliantly look I have brilliantly used   those laws I have often said or the   campaign trail that I have a fiduciary   responsibility to pay no more tax than   is legally required like anybody lost or   but another way to pay as little tax as   legally possible and I must tell you I   hate the way they spend our tax dollars   [Applause]   and believe me that makes a difference   as a major real estate developer in this   country and throughout the world I faced   enormous taxes city taxes state taxes   sales taxes excise taxes employee taxes   federal taxes vat taxes different   countries it's my job to minimize the   overall tax burden to the greatest   extent possible which allows me to   reinvest in neighborhoods in workers and   build amazing properties which fuel   tremendous growth in their communities   and always help our great providers of   jobs and we have to help our small   businesses what it's all about what it's   all about   the news media is now obsessed with an   alleged tax filing from the 1990s at the   end of one of the most brutal economic   downturns in our country's history if   you remember the early 90s other than i   would say 1928 there was nothing even   close the conditions facing real estate   developers in that early 90 period were   almost as bad as the Great Depression of   1929 and far worse than the Great   Recession of 2008 not even close what   had been a booming economy in the era of   Ronald Reagan changed dramatically and   the business landscape changed with it   bank failures and collapse the absolute   total destruction of the Savings and   Loan industry and the implosion of the   retail market and real estate in general   something we've never seen anything like   it many business people including many   of my competitors and some of my friends   were not able to survive company's jobs   and opportunities were lost and lives   were destroyed as tens of thousands of   people were put out of work some of the   biggest and strongest people and   companies went absolutely bankrupt which   I never did by the way are you proud of   me   [Applause]   would have loved to use that card but I   just didn't want to do thank you yet   today my company is bigger stronger far   greater assets and it's ever had before   more premium properties we've never done   better it's the strongest we've ever   been and we employ thousands of people   in over the years have employed   thousands and thousands of people which   is the thing that frankly makes me most   happy that did not happen by chance or   luck it happened by action and talent   lot of talent I was able to use the tax   laws of this country and my business   acumen to dig out of the real estate   mess you would call it a depression when   few others were able to do what I did in   those most if I'm a star thank you you   are too   oh they were amazing times in those most   difficult times when so many had their   backs to the wall I reached within   myself and delivered from my company my   employees my family and the communities   where my properties existed and I really   delivered those who spend their entire   lives within the confines of government   work and who know virtually nothing of   business fail to understand the skill   dedication this year grid it takes for a   company to climb out of an economic   depression of the scale we had in the   early 90s   [Applause]   people like my opponent Hillary Clinton   whose only   [Applause]   folks let's win on november eighth okay   [Applause]   anyway our only method of making money   is by selling government favors and   granting access to special interests   know nothing about how businesses   succeed and grow Hillary Clinton has   never created a single job in her entire   life by the way we have somebody who has   Wiz Bernie Marcus where's Bernie Bernie   Marcus founder of home depot go to Home   Depot he only created about hundreds of   thousands how many jobs is Home Depot   produce right now Bernie how much   millions millions Bernie that's a lot of   jobs a great guy a great man an   unbelievable entrepreneuring somebody   that put a lot of people to work and   home depot is a terrific company and   thank you for being here Bernie   appreciate it thank you they haven't   added a single dollar of value people   like Hillary to the American economy   Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest   dollar in her entire life all she does   is takes from you takes from your   country and pedals influence to donors   special interests and foreign actors for   astronomical dollars like you've never   seen before its corruption of the   highest order you know it I know it she   knows it and plenty of other people know   it but they're not doing anything about   it well I made my money as a very   successful private business person   following the law all the way Hillary   Clinton made her money as a corrupt   public official breaking the law and   putting her government office up for   sale and now she's running for president   by her own account Hillary Clinton left   the White House dead broke she said dead   bro and then remember she became a   senator for New York did nothing   remember the job she was going to   produce you never produce him and then   she became Secretary of State and now   she and her husband have made more than   200 million dollars without building a   company or creating a single thing of   value during the early 90s as companies   went absolutely bus they were collapsing   all over the place left and right the   media and powers-that-be said Donald   Trump he could never ever make it back   oh I remember those stories we were all   and so how many people then were in   trouble like everybody was in trouble   but they said and they were so gleeful   he could never make it back they said I   had billions of dollars in borrowing   which is true and hundreds of millions   dollars in personal guarantees which is   true and no pathway out which is false   that was a bad time that was an ugly   time a lot of people you'll never hear   from him again from that period but I   never had any doubts whatsoever and most   importantly I never ever gave up or even   thought about giving up that's because I   knew in my heart that when the chips are   down is when I perform the very best   that is always when I perform the best   just want to make my best decisions   judgments you remember Bernie saying   Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and   honestly my single greatest asset   probably is temperament because if you   didn't have the right temperament you   could have never escaped that financial   jungle that's for sure single greatest   asset is my temperament and I have a   temperament for winning you have to win   we have a temperament all of us for   winning   and when people make the mistake of   underestimating me that's when they are   really in for their biggest surprise   same thing with a lot of the people in   this room just look at what happened in   the primary remember the primary Trump's   running oh don't worry about it he's the   star of The Apprentice he built a nice   company don't worry just look at what   happened our incredible movement is   doing just take a look this is a   movement folks a movement like they've   never seen what we've done is amazing   and now we have one person left crooked   Hillary and we have to beat her on   november eighth and you have to get out   and vote and you have to get out and   make calls that you have to do and   jokingly i like to say if you sick if   you get the absolute worst prognosis   from the doctor and it looks like maybe   you're not even going to make it it   doesn't make a damn bit of difference   get up and vote or november   but the reason I never felt in dangers   really and I never did I never felt   endangered during the real estate   downturn I guess I didn't read the   stories what is that I knew myself I   knew my business I knew the financial   system I knew the tax code and most   importantly I knew how to fight because   that's what you had to do that was fight   and that's what I am I'm a fighter and   I'm now going to fight for you I'm not   fighting for me anymore I'm fighting for   you fighting for you   with my knowledge I knew that I would   make a comeback without question I never   had a doubt in my mind and again I don't   know i don't even think of it as a   comeback it was just like you know we   had tough periods good period stuff   periods we just knew that things were   going to be just fine but that is why   I'm here today thank you doing and I'm   praying for you and I love you   great people now I get the whole hero   thing now I   [Applause]   but that is why I have left private   business to go into public life if you   would have ever told me that I was going   to be doing this now had I known I was   going to be doing this I would have   commenced with certain television   interviews radio interviews I would have   said things slightly differently and I   wouldn't have had as good a time in life   and as much fun in life but it would   have made my life is a politician a   little bit easier right and you know   these people holier-than-thou Nate they   never say anything around the breakfast   room table do they do they never do Bill   and Hillary never say anything like this   around the breakfast can you imagine   what they say well they talk about   deplorable Zandi redeemable is right I   talk about that you're deplorable your   irredeemable I think irredeemable might   be worse if you think it everyone talks   about deplorable a these are the   greatest people in this room and many   other rooms like it we've seen hundreds   of thousands of people these are the   greatest people and really importantly   we're going to make it great for all of   the people it's not my people or people   that are voting from me we're going to   make it great for all of our people in   this country but I'm doing this and I'm   doing it for a very specific reason   because I understand our country is in   very very bad shape   [Applause]   that's all right sounds like a nice   person oh oh I thought that was the   Commission on Presidential Debates i was   working i said i didn't know they were   here   you know when they were playing with the   mic back forth I thought that was the   Commission though that's a beautiful   Commission let's see what happens on   Sunday again my biggest opponent was the   microphone and now our country is in   need of a major comeback it needs one   now just about more than ever we owe 20   trillion dollars in debt doubled during   Obama's period as president double think   of it but that's only part of the story   we have over 100 trillion dollars in   unfunded liabilities and we have a   budget that's out of control with annual   deficits in addition because of the in   competence of our leaders we run massive   trade deficits on an annual basis I'll   get Bernie to negotiate a couple of   these trade deals you'll find out and we   now have almost 800 billion dollars a   year in trade deficits and you said   yourself who these people negotiating   ideas our country is broke it's broken   and the worst part is that with all of   the money we spend so foolishly all over   the world stupidly all over the world we   protect other countries with tremendous   I mean tremendous losses and we want to   protect countries but they should pay us   the proper amount why should we be   losing mine   [Applause]   but think of it with all of the money   that we spend and with 20 trillion   dollars in debt and all of the things we   do and all of the talk and all of the   political nonsense we have a decaying   infrastructure we are failing schools we   have rising crime we have a depleted   military are great people and a depleted   military we have planes that are so old   they go to aeroplanes graveyards to take   out parts they go to museums to take out   parts because they don't make the parts   anymore we have an open border we have   an economy that can't create full-time   high-paying jobs because our jobs are   great jobs many of them have been have   been taken and we will build the wall   don't worry we're going to build a wall   we're going to build the wall we're   going to build the wall we're going to   build a wall hey we're going to build a   wall Mexico's going to pay for the wall   they don't know it yet but they're going   to pay for the raw   and you have a tremendous problem right   here but we're going to have drugs stop   pouring into our country destroying our   youth poisoning our people poisoning our   people we r divided nation and each week   it seems we're getting more and more   divided with race riots on our streets   on a monthly basis now somebody said   don't call them race rights but that's   what they are their restaurants and it's   happening more and more you looked at   Charlotte a great city where I have   property a great city you look at   different places around our country st.   Louis Ferguson Baltimore Chicago in   Chicago thousands of shootings thousands   since January first four thousand   shootings think of it since January this   is not the America that was handed down   to us and it's not the America that we   want to leave to our children   [Applause]   and it's certainly not the America we   want to pass down to our grandchildren   but this is the America we will have if   we don't turn things around starting   immediately we don't have much time   folks we don't have much time and if we   don't win this election it will never   happen again this opportunity is never   going to happen again what I say is not   lost on the American people because   seventy percent of you believe our   country is headed in the wrong direction   and I'm trying to figure out who the   other thirty percent are I want to meet   him we cannot have another four years of   Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will be   worse she will be worse   we can turn our country around but if we   don't make a change in leadership right   now it'll never happen the failed   political establishment must go it must   go for the sake of your country your   future and those you love the most   [Applause]   in the early 90s they splashed the front   pages with stories about how Donald   Trump me they said I was finished   everybody said that I was done there   were front page articles in The Wall   Street Journal in the New York Times   among many others they were thrilled and   delighted and i'm still here can you   believe these people they know speaking   they're going crazy can you believe the   Wall Street Journal the New York Times   they are going crazy they say 1990s and   now here I am still they say can we ever   get rid of this guy but they were   thrilled to write these negative stories   so they said I was finished the only   person who didn't think that I was in   trouble was a guy named Donald J Trump I   didn't think I was in proper I sort of   didn't know what they were talking about   does that make sense power of positive   thinking but I didn't know what they   were talking about I started my company   with a small loan and as I grew I   borrowed money to grow the company and   big money from big banks when the bottom   fell out of the real estate market I had   this large amount of debt and it stayed   the same but the value of assets   plummeted say have to learn I was young   and you have to learn and I learned and   I worked really hard but I knew how to   use the tax code to rebuild my company   when others didn't I knew how to   understand and I fully understood the   banks and the bankers and how to deal   with them I knew a lot but my   understanding of the tax code gave me a   tremendous advantage over those who   didn't have a clue about it including   many of my competitors who lost   everything they had never to be heard   from again never they would never heard   from again some people that I knew they   were good they were doing a good job   never ever to be heard from again now   they're gone and I'm here and I'm ready   to turn things around for our country   we're going to do it the early 90s was a   very tough time for the world but in   tough times you need very tough and very   smart people these are tough times for   America and I will tell you we need very   tough and very smart leadership not   people who tell you what you want to   hear but people who tell you what you   need to hear we must never allow corrupt   career politicians like the Clintons   ever back into the white house again   [Applause]   these tough times were when I performed   my very best the economy and banks they   were collapsing the government was a   mess but I enjoyed waking up every day   to go to battle and that's what it was   for three years I had an expression in   the early 90s survived till 95 and   you'll be okay and a people copied it   survived till 95 I enjoyed getting up   every morning to take on the financial   establishment on behalf of my company my   employees my family and myself and win   and that's what we did I 1 I 1 and I   kept on winning till this day I kept on   winning all you have to do is ask all of   the 17 people that we competed against   and you'll ask them how did Trump do   they'll say he won   but that's the thinking we need for our   country that's the thinking we need when   we're negotiating trade deals which are   horrible and military deals and economic   deals on behalf of the American people   we need great people negotiating our   deals for us we have the greatest   negotiators and the greatest business   people in the world and we use political   hacks to negotiate our deals not anymore   we're not not anymore put me into the   boardroom as your representatives and I   promise I will deliver Hillary Clinton   is in it only for herself her donors and   her special interests I'm fighting for   America many people   many people have said over the years   that I perform better under pressure   than anyone they've ever seen I proven   that over and over again and that's what   I do and that's what we have to do right   now because our country is under   tremendous pressure when the pressure is   on when the odds are stacked against me   and you because many of you people are   the same way when people say it can't be   done that's when we just get started   we're going to change things around   [Applause]   the thing that motivates me the most is   when people tell me something is   absolutely impossible from me impossible   is just a starting point that's when you   begin and remember with 20 trillion in   debt and a hundred trillion and unfunded   liabilities a lot of people say it's   impossible we're sitting on a big fat   ugly bubble and Obama doesn't allow our   fed to raise interest rates because when   those interest rates go you watch what's   going to happen it's going to be very   unattractive he'll be out playing golf   someplace but you know what they're   wrong and what they're doing and it's   unfair to the people it's unfair to the   country and they're so wrong from the   depths of that terrible real estate   depression I created a company worth   billions and billions of dollars and   created tens of thousands of jobs our   company our employees we remade i mean   we actually remade skylines together   revitalize neighborhoods rejuvenated   communities and hired thousands and   thousands of workers on november eight   America's comeback begins and we need a   comeback   and we are going to rise up from our   present challenges bigger and better and   stronger than ever before   a lot of people said why are you going   to Pueblo I said number one I like the   state number one everything about Pueblo   says winner including what Dwight   Eisenhower said long ago   and they said well do you think they'll   like you in pueblo I said I think so   they said they said they said when you   have a lot of hispanic / latinos in   Pueblo and I said I think that's why   they're going to like me actually that's   why they're going to like me believe me   [Applause]   when you look at what's happening with   the african-american community when you   look at what's happening with Hispanic   community very very unfair very very   unfair thank you   the people here in Puebla know what it   takes to rebuild this country this is a   city with a friend or friend or foe   friend or foe well he's got a very weak   voice so you could let him say but just   be good sir be nice be nice we all love   you you're on the other side you know   the Sanders people had so much more   spirit and vim and vigor than the   Hillary people the Hillary people are   not in the same category if Bernie   Sanders had not made the deal with the   devil he would have gone down in the   history of politics as a very rare and   unique person but when he made that deal   and I know that he wish he didn't his   followers are lost he had an event   recently where 150 people showed up to   hear him talk and I will say this we've   always had by far the biggest crowds but   you know what he was second he was   second but he made a deal with the devil   and his supporters are no longer really   his supporters any longer that I can   talk to you and you know one of the one   of the things that Bernie Sanders and I   agreed on is trade and trade is   something that is so sad for this   country what's happening how did your   jobs are being taken the differences I   can do something about it and make a bad   deal into a great deal all he knew is it   was bad and we want to do something   about it we just can't be a critic this   is a city with a rich immigrant history   and a rich Latino history   [Applause]   the Latinos love Trump right   [Applause]   that has contributed so much to this   country into the state amazing place   through the people of Pueblo thank you   and their families we've hail from all   regions they've come from all regions of   the world you are united by this one   very important factor you are all   Americans   [Applause]   and as Americans you're entitled to the   same protections as every other American   gets everyone living lawfully inside our   borders are entitled to the same things   safe communities a great education and   access to high paying jobs and really   good jobs and this isn't happening this   is the change that I will deliver   Hillary Clinton has been there for 30   years delivering nothing but talk and   failure you know the other night when we   were at the debate I noticed more than   ever before we're at the debate and she   say she's going to do this this this and   that and I said to myself why hasn't she   been doing it for 30 years right just   talk her policies have brought death and   destruction overseas and poverty at home   she's brought massive poverty for   everyone but especially for African   American and Latino citizens she comes   and tries to get their vote although I   must tell you the enthusiasm for her is   very small Don King the great boxing   promoter who endorsed me said Donald the   african-americans Donald love you Don   King big dong and here's a man whether   you like him or not that's a smart   cookie a tough cookie and he's done a   job he's done a job but he said you are   going to see a big surprise on november   eighth with in hit this case he was   talking about the african americans he   said you're going to see a big surprise   because so many african-american people   love you and they want you to really   help them out in terms of the inner   cities in particular where it's so   dangerous where education is so bad   where jobs are non-existent where youth   cannot get jobs   so I want to thank Don King and so many   others for their endorsement we had so   many others so many reverends and   pastors bishop jackson from detroit   credible people darrell scott pastor   darrell scott so many and i'm so honored   by than believing i am honored by it and   Don said that Hillary Clinton takes the   african-american vote for granted here's   the bad news I don't think you're going   to want to go out and vote for this is   not Barack Obama where they really had   spirit to vote for him nobody has spirit   remember she called african-american   male youth super predators   who wants to vote first he's not going   to do the job anyway she opposes school   choice and she wants to trap   african-american and Latino children   into the failing government schools   because she's getting a lot of money   from the teachers unions so she doesn't   want to have choice and she doesn't want   to end common course so we can bring   education locally which is very   important she has her own accord we're   going to get poor minority I'm telling   you I'm telling you the Commission on   presidential debates is operating this   microphone every time the Secret Service   hears that sound like a wall now that   Commission on presidential debates what   a joke they are I got to go through them   on Sunday night again and by the way   Mike Pence on Tuesday night he has been   fantastic Governor Mike Pence what a   fantastic on Tuesday night Tuesday night   we are going to get poor minority   children out of failing schools and into   the public private charter or magnet   school of their choice going to be a big   difference   I'll tell you the Latino children the   african-american children it's going to   be some difference believe me some   difference Hillary Clinton supports   Obamacare and wants to expand it and   Obamacare is an absolute disaster how   much have they raise your premiums of   the Terry a double-double how about   triple quadruple it's horrible and it's   going to die of its own weight but we   are going to we are going to terminate   it and we are going to replace it and it   will be so much better than so much less   explosive premiums in Colorado are set   to go up another twenty percent the only   way to stop this disaster is the vote   for Trump I'm telling you okay don't be   going down Hillary Clinton also supports   the terrible trade deals like Bill   Clinton's NAFTA and China's entry into   the World Trade Organization and next   she wants to support trans-pacific   partnership the deal she calls the gold   standard that she lied to during the   bait she said she never called it the   gold standard and Lester Holt kept   questioning me on everything but he   never questioned her on that right and   it turned out to be a lie she called it   the gold standard and she will approve   it if she gets in but if she gets in you   people have made one bad mistake i can   tell you Colorado has lost more than one   in seven manufacturing jobs since NAFTA   and China deals but while you've lost   out Hillary Clinton has raked in cash   from her contributors she and Bill have   made 150 million dollars in speeches and   she's a bad speaker to special interests   they gave 39 speeches to big banks   including two million dollars in   speaking fees from Goldman Sachs the   Clintons received another two million   dollars from a Swiss bank after Hillary   negotiated a favorable settlement for   them as Secretary of State   [Music]   to hide her corruption Hillary Clinton   puts her emails on an illegal secret   server open to foreign hacking then she   deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after   a congressional subpoena to hide them   from the public she lies to Congress   under oath and her ring leaders took the   Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals   explained that way in so many ways it's   worse than watergate the investigation   of Hillary Clinton was rigged and it's a   shame and it's one of the saddest things   that have ever taken place in our nation   believe me what's gone on we become a   banana republic you know what we have   now today we learned that the FBI made a   side deal with Clinton stop aids to   destroy their laptops did you know this   let me repeat the FBI reportedly made a   deal to destroy the laptops of   government officials implicated in a   massive criminal cover-up I think you   have a lot of great people in the FBI   and you do indeed I think they're   extremely upset at what's going on   Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a   criminal enterprise that has corrupted   our government at the highest levels and   the American people have one chance to   stop it by showing up and voting on   November a   people have had it with the years and   decades of Clinton corruption this is   the year the American people say enough   is enough the Clintons are the sordid   past we are together as a movement all   of us outside of this area all over the   country we are the bright future now   another issue I want to address today   finally is immigration as i mentioned   Pueblo is filled with wonderful   hard-working immigrants it's these   hard-working immigrants who stand to   lose the most from our open border   immigration policy illegal immigration   and broken visa programs take jobs   directly from Latino and Hispanic   workers living here lawfully today you   know that they're taking you jobs   illegal immigration also brings with it   massive crime and massive drugs   including a terrible heroin problem   right here in Colorado you have a big   problem so we're going to build a border   wall and we are not what   we're going to build a wall and we're   going to stop the drugs the gangs the   violence from pouring into Colorado   [Applause]   we got a lot of bad people that gay men   we have great people that came in but we   have a lot of gang members we have a lot   of drug lords we have a lot of drug   sellers we're going to ship them the   hell out come immediately   we're going to shut down the sanctuary   cities that have led to the preventable   deaths of so many   [Applause]   cases like Kate Steinle murdered in San   Francisco by a five-time deported   illegal immigrant who should never ever   have been here or cases like Sarah root   killed by an illegal immigrant released   at the border by President Obama and   then released again after the killing   there were over two million criminal   aliens in this country and we are going   to get them out and get them out fast   [Applause]   to the cartels the gangs the drug   dealers I have a simple message for you   your days are numbered and your reign of   crime will soon come crashing to an end   but we also have to keep our country   safe from terrorism the terrorist who   planted the bombs in new york and new   jersey and who carried out the mall   stabbing in minnesota you all saw that   last week where foreign nationals   admitted into our country as was the   mall shooter in washington look at cases   like the Boston bombers here an asylum   or the San Bernardino shooter here on a   fiance visa fee on said nice Lisa from   Saudi Arabia killed 14 people that gave   them a baby shower a short while before   and she killed him not only kill them   but many many many horribly wounded to   this day or the Orlando shooter the son   of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan   terrorists are infiltrating our country   now Hillary Clinton wants a five hundred   and fifty percent increase in Syrian   refugees and countless more refugees   from across the Middle East   I want to keep your family safe my job   is not to represent foreign countries my   job is to represent the citizens of the   United States of America putting your   jobs your wages and your security first   America first remember that America   first you are living in the United   States today as a lawful resident or a   US citizen I will ensure you have a safe   community rising wages and secure   immigration system which is what we want   immigration security is national   security very important it's national   security here are some of the things we   will do starting in 2017 we're going to   lower your taxes substantially she's   going to raise your taxes we're going to   eliminate every unnecessary regulation   we're going to repeal and replace   job-killing Obamacare we will make child   care affordable we're going to save your   second Amendment which is under siege   [Applause]   and I have the endorsement of the NRA   very early on great people we're going   to support the men and women of law   enforcement and we're going to appoint   justices to the Supreme Court of the   United States who will uphold and defend   our Constitution we are going to finally   rebuild America we are going to   revitalize America we are going to unite   America we're going to come together as   a people imagine what our country could   accomplish if we started working   together as one people under one God   saluting one American flag   [Applause]   together we will make America wealthy   again we will make America strong again   we will make America safe again and we   will make America like your cap we will   make America great again thank you   everybody god bless you god bless you   thank you thank you   [Music]

absentee ballot   today and vote really   early we've got to win the Hillary   Clinton documents released today by   WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just   how much is at stake in this election so   much corruption this election will   determine whether we remain a free   country in the truest sense of the word   or we become a corrupt Banana Republic   controlled by large donors and foreign   governments the election of Hillary   Clinton would lead to the destruction of   our country believe me it will lead to   the destruction of our country today we   learned amazingly that the Department of   Justice fed information to the Clinton   campaign about the email investigation   so that the campaign could be prepared   to cover up her crimes what is going on   Rudy Giuliani said it this is collusion   and corruption of the highest order and   is one more reason why I asked my   attorney general I will ask to appoint a   special prosecutor   we have to investigate Hillary Clinton   and we have to investigate the   investigation this was a disgrace this   was a disgrace Hillary bleached and   deleted 33,000 emails after   congressional subpoenas can you imagine   that they got a subpoena from the United   States Congress and then they deleted   everything if you did that in private   life you go to jail and then destroyed   her phones some were the hammer boom   anybody destroy your phones before with   a hammer anybody know anybody know and   people have gone to jail for doing far   less she also lost think of this she was   Secretary of State lost as much as six   billion dollars in taxpayer money while   she was running secretary of state now   some people say it was misplaced Oh   billions of dollars misplaced these   wikileaks emails confirm what those of   us here today have known all along   Hillary Clinton is the vessel a corrupt   global establishment that's raiding our   country and surrendering the sovereignty   of our nation this criminal government   cartel doesn't recognize borders but   believes in global governance unlimited   immigration and ruled by corporations it   also believes in no borders just come on   folks come on in speaking in secret to a   foreign bank again just revealed Hillary   Clinton said my dream is a hemispheric   common market with open trade and open   borders will there go the rusty of   businesses and there goes your country   folks she doesn't say that behind closed   doors when she thought no one was   listening she pledged to dissolve the   borders of the United States of America   no borders you don't have borders we   don't have a country WikiLeaks has given   us a   window into the secret carter's of   government power where we see a former   Secretary of State announcing her desire   to end forever the American independence   that our founders gave to us and wanted   us to have American soldiers have fought   and died to win and keep America's   freedom and now Hillary Clinton wants to   surrender that freedom to these open   borders open trade and a world   government and by the way we want a   government for the United States we're   very happy with it we're very happy   crooked Hillary is so radical and   immigration that as Secretary of State   she refused to make foreign countries   take back their criminal aliens we have   them all over the place she didn't want   to bring him back they'd bring him back   the countries were smart they said we   don't want him would say okay we'll take   him and then you look at the crime and   you wonder why and by the way do you   know it was just announced that murder   is the highest it's been in our country   in 45 years you've heard that right one   such killer who was set free on   Hillary's watch went to a jail came out   and went on to kill a beautiful young   American girl named Casey Chadwick   people have heard that name beautiful   wonderful person the killer who had   already been convicted for shooting a   girl in the head should have been sent   home instead he was set free and stabbed   Casey in the face and neck 15 times   violently and stuffed her body in a   closet the corrupt establishment in   Washington wants to surrender America's   borders even as they send our troops   overseas to protect the borders of   foreign countries were protecting the   borders of foreign countries but not our   borders a trump administration will   secure control defend and protect the   borders of the United States   we are going to protect and the Border   Patrol agents just gave us as you know   their endorsement never did it before   ice just gave us their endorsement   sheriff joe from arizona just gave us   his adult even Chelsea Clinton the   WikiLeaks email show expressed serious   concerns about conflicts of interest at   the Clinton Foundation and the State   Department during a recent trip to   Florida I had a chance to spend some   time with the incredible residence of   Little Haiti the Haitian community has   contributed so much to this country and   to this state I also learned from them   firsthand how much they despised the   Clintons for what they did to the people   of haiti new emails revealed today by   ABC News show that during the deadly   earthquake in Haiti which killed over   150,000 people at least the Clintons   couldn't stop cashing in as people were   dying in Haiti Clinton insiders were   separating out requests from friends of   bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs   so that their business interest or   contracts would receive very special   treatment people who were labeled not   friends of bill were placed very much on   the sidelines in their biggest project   that Clinton's use four hundred million   dollars in aid and US taxpayer funds to   build what amounted to a massive   sweatshop and guess who set it up Cheryl   Mills Hillary's chief of staff who   helped destroy her emails and then got   immunity from the FBI that included the   destruction of her computer   never been anything folks there's never   been anything like this there's never   been what's gone on here with the email   destruction with the deletion of   thousands and thousands and last week it   was revealed that two boxes of emails   and information were missing they were   missing their God the company that   benefited from Mills actions then   invented in a company they put a lot of   money in a company owned by Cheryl Mills   they invested today as Hades death toll   from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise we   should never forget how Bill and Hillary   Clinton handled Haiti the last time out   to all of our friends in Haiti and to   all of our friends in Little Haiti who   are so amazing your day of justice is   coming and it arrives on november eighth   we've got to do this got a day we've got   to do it not only of the Clintons ripped   off Haiti but the new emails show   members of the Clinton team attacking   Catholics while this is offensive it's   just the latest evidence of the hatred   that the Clinton campaign has really for   everyday Americans and you see it and   you see so much from these wikileaks you   see so much this so much we've all read   the reports and heard the stories about   how disrespectfully she treats law   enforcement you've seen it how   disrespectful she is to the Secret   Service and many others in uniform even   there to protect her and by the way   these are weapon carrying people they   carry weapons Hillary Clinton wants to   really dismantle our Second Amendment   you know so maybe she should start with   her security people not carrying weapons   does that make sense to you   maybe maybe she should she even smeared   all of America's police officers as   essentially racist you heard that   recently essentially racist and by the   way I want to give a shout-out and   salute to our great people of law   enforcement our police have done an   amazing job I'm proud of the fact that   I've always treated the working people   of this country with dignity and respect   especially our military and law   enforcement personnel these are amazing   people the WikiLeaks emails show that   Hillary staff even has given up secret   notes on when she needs to smile it's   all a phony deal with her by the way did   everybody see the debate right gotten   good reviews good reviews gotten good   reviews we'll see what happens but Pat   Buchanan said the greatest of any   presidential debate the greatest   performance thank you very much folks   like you and we had eight online polls   and every one of those it's time   magazine and Drudge and so many others   and every one of them said we won by a   massive margin so let's hope it all   boils down let's hope it all boils down   to winning on november eighth otherwise   honestly i've wasted my time you've   wasted your time I will have spent over   100 million dollars on running for   office a lot of money a lot of money   that's not the thing if I don't win it   will be the single greatest waste of   time energy and money and you know   somebody told me recently a pundit said   doesn't matter whether you want to lose   what we've done all of us what we've   done but what I've done has never been   duplicated there's never been anything   like this in American history you look   at our crowds I mean Bernie Sanders was   second his crowds are tiny did you see   Hillary   written today she had this little crowd   and they say always the biggest crowd   she had nothing she had nothing and they   talking on television because the   media's rigged let me tell you the best   thing she's got going my opinion the   only thing she's got going is the rigged   media that he's got nothing going can   you imagine working with her for four   more years the last thing we need the   last thing we need is another four years   of Barack Obama we don't need that   believe me that's what we're going to   get did we get her but the emails also   show yet again that the DNC Democratic   National Committee rigged the democratic   election the primary process to take it   away from birdie and give it to Hillary   Clinton the DNC vice chair was caught   feeding information about Bernie Sanders   plans to the Clinton campaign yeah   that's supposed to do that supposed to   be you know if I was Bernie I wouldn't   be too happy after watching what came   out today on Wikileaks a Bernie was used   and in all fairness Bernie made a deal   with the devil and he made a big mistake   he could have gone down to something   very important in American history when   he made that deal he sold out he sold   out and very very bad but to all the   Bernie voters out there don't vote for a   Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton   and you remember this the one thing I   had in mind and one thing we had in   common with crooked Hillary was borders   the borders are much stronger that's why   I have all the endorsements from   everybody on the borders but Bernie knew   that we were getting ripped off on trade   and he was right except my numbers are   much different we're going to redo it   we're going to have unbelievable trade   deals we're going to make unbelievable   deals but to the bernese to the Bernie   Sanders people you get sold out   but remember this I'm much stronger on   trade so much stronger on trade that   Bernie and trade was a big deal because   he was right we are getting sold out our   jobs of being lost our jobs of being   taken we're being sold out a vote for   Hillary is a vote for more reckless   foreign invasions more Wall Street   cheating more terrible trade deals and   as confirmed yesterday by WikiLeaks   Hillary also wants to cut Medicare and   Social Security she wants to do that a   vote for Trump is a vote for America   first and as a vote to protect Medicare   and Social Security believe me we're   going to protect our Medicare we're   going to protect our social security   she's not gonna do it she's also going   to raise your taxes big league folks   that we're going to lower your taxes   minor minor thing but just remember it   WikiLeaks also shows something I've been   warning every of everybody everybody   about for a long time the media is   simply an extension of Hillary Clinton's   campaign it's just one more way that the   system is rigged a big way really a big   way reporters who work for these outlets   like The Washington Post or the New York   Times may think of themselves as   journalists but they're actually just   cogs in a corporate political machine   the dishonesty of the New York Times is   unbelievable the dishonesty of the   Washington Post is unbelievable the   dishonesty of all of those cameras so   many of them not all of them is   unbelievable the emails show the New   York Times The Boston Globe Univision a   third-rate reporter named John Harwood   what a third-rate reporter that one is   they remember he did the debate and made   a total fool of himself he's of CNBC all   doing favors for the Clinton   and reporters smothering the Clintons   with praise why why you saw Hillary on   the debate stage do you think do you   think that's really worthy do you really   think that's worthy folks do you think   that's what this country is all about   the new york times even gave clinton   veto power over her quotes in a major   story i've never heard about that i'd   like to have veto power when they   misquote me all the time it's actually   corruption the emails also show that   hillary was given the CNN Town Hall   questions before her big debate against   Bernie Sanders is that possible donna   Brazile the DNC vice chair email from   time to time I get questions in advance   she said oh that's fair how do you think   that's fair to Bernie I'm starting fear   they really aren't we starting to feel   sorry for Bernie Sanders like a little   bit right the media can't report on the   establishment because the media largely   is the establishment and the corrupt   media is teamed up against you the   American people and I used to get great   press until I said I'm running then they   said he's running we don't want him to   run but I used to get great who got   better press than me I got great press a   lot of press my wife said the other day   used to get such great press now every   single story is a slant and I'll tell   you what it's libelous and slanderous   it's horrible and it's really unfair but   we're going to beat the system we're   going to beat the system   we're going to break up the failed   establishment and the chronic corruption   and create a new and bright American   future I didn't need to do this folks I   didn't need to do this but we have to do   it and we have the greatest people on   earth the the people of our country   these are the greatest people on earth   I've gotten to know so many our veterans   are so incredible they're not being   taken care of our military our police we   have the greatest people on earth   Hillary Clinton the candidate of the   past today dredged up Al Gore did you   see him anybody see him didn't he say he   was the founder of the internet he   wasn't to campaign with her in Florida   al gore wants to eliminate the   combustion engine essentially and flies   around the world on jets and pushes   plans that would help create China make   it stronger they make so much of our   product they make so much they make so   many of our big windmills and you know   when they're making them that steel and   all of that stuff that they talk about   going up into the air but it's got to go   up into the air maybe we should be   making them instead of China Germany and   other places the obama-clinton EPA spend   billions on failed climate projects   instead of repairing water   infrastructure in cities like flint   remember Flint what a shame my   administration will address important   environmental priorities like the   Everglades and it's your quality water   all across America including the fixing   of water problems like Lake Okeechobee   it's amazing you know Lake Okeechobee   they're always letting the water out   gibbehhh knows we always have droughts   they're always letting the water out I   said keep it in we won't have so many   Krauts we don't have any droughts but   Lake Okeechobee and you know a lot of   things have happened Hilary has received   millions of dollars from donors who want   to shut down american energy old   together radical activists like Tom   Steyer have promised to spend more than   70 million dollars this election to get   Clinton and Democrats like are elected   in return Clinton wants to shut down   energy production all across the United   States what you see your energy bills   we're going to put the miners and the   steelworkers of our country back to work   there do it Hillary Clinton and Al Gore   support the Paris deal which will cost   america over five trillion dollars and   cause Florida electricity rates to   skyrocket over the years skyrocket think   of it we're going to spend five trillion   dumbs and you know it's going to happen   we're going to become non competitive   with other countries other countries are   eating our lunch right now they're   eating our lunch we're going to become   non competitive the Paris deal also   allows China the world's largest   polluter by far to increase emissions   for more than a dozen years while the   United States makes drastic cuts   immediately right now what's that all   about why are we doing it together   what's that about who negotiates our   deals it's one more way that Clinton's   have surrendered American prosperity to   China and so many other countries we are   led by people that are grossly   incompetent folks they're grossly   incompetent how about the 400 million in   cash that they gave a rand that turned   out to be one point seven billion   you know what 1.7 billion is it's like   the stage loaded up with money nobody   has ever seen it can you imagine these   people in Iran when they see the money   they say can you believe this boy did we   hit the jackpot three years ago before   we made them rich they would die as a   country they were ready to go but we   made them rich we made him rich how   about the 800 people ready for   deportation remember two weeks ago ready   for deportation they made a mistake they   all became United States citizens right   and these were people that were not   exactly too good that's why they were   being deported but the 800 turned out to   be wrong somebody actually said Trump   was wrong in the number i said oh man   here we go was it 400 was at seven   ninety-nine no it was one I guess was   what 17 1800 it turned out so much more   than the eight they said I was wrong   because I was low and the whole thing is   crazy so I said you know what that's   okay just reverse the proj you know get   them you can deport them they said that   wouldn't be constitutional hey folks   don't we're being led by stupid people   we're being led by stupid people and   Hillary Clinton will be worse than Obama   if I'm elected president we are going to   start winning again we don't win anymore   the WikiLeaks peaches even show Clinton   praising the president of China for   promising to assert his authority my   energy proposals will unlock the 50   trillion dollars in energy reserves   right here in America this means new   jobs in florida not new jobs in china   we're going to make America first folks   America first   it's all part of our plan to make   America rich again but to make America   rich again we also have to repeal and   replace the disaster known as Obamacare   bill clinton in a rare moment of truth   telling said Obamacare was a crazy   system where people wind up with their   premiums doubled and their coverage cut   in half now on this he was right right   on this to you was right we got to give   him credit oh boy did he suffer that   night can you imagine that was last week   he suffered gravely when he went home i   EI EI the next day he came in he said   the event other sort of i'm only kidding   i'm only kidding bring members are going   to surge next year here in florida   beyond what you've ever seen before and   all across the country i just left texas   great state they gone up sixty percent   through bluecross blueshield sixty   percent and remember this the election   on november eighth they're trying to   announce many of these massive increases   after the election don't let it happen   you're going to have hundred percent   increases you're going to have ninety   five percent increases but you've   already got sixty-eight percent   seventy-two percent insurers are fleeing   patients are losing their doctors   remember you can keep your doctor you   can keep your plan 28 times obama said   that he lied and the best students don't   want to be doctors anymore they used to   want to be doctors doctors have more   accountants working for him now than   they have nurses it's so complicated   it's a giant mess a giant catastrophe   that will destroy American health care   for good if we don't get rid of it and   this election is going to be so pivotal   in terms of your health care in terms of   costs for health care so remember you're   going to get great health care at a far   far reduced course you're going to be   much less expensive this Obamacare is a   nightmare   it is a nightmare and by the way Hillary   Clinton wants to go to a single-payer   the government's going to take care of   your everything it's going to cost so   much money you know in Canada where they   have a better version that what she's   talking about when people with some   money won an operation they come into   the United States to get it it's slow it   doesn't work doesn't work anywhere we   have concepts that is so good in fact   concepts that are so good that they'll   only get better so much less money so we   have to repeal and replace Obamacare   it's killing the country and it's   killing the people that have to pay for   it both of it but you have to get out   we're going to do it and you have to   vote we're going to replace Obamacare   with health savings accounts so you can   choose the private doctor that you want   at the center of our economic revival   will be fixing our terrible terrible   trade shows if you remember on june   sixteenth of last year that is when i   said we're going to run you know it   takes a lot of guts and courage to do   this i started off there were 17 people   great people all nice people some didn't   you know honor their pledge but these   are minor details right but we had some   great people many of whom are supporting   us dr. ben Carson we have great guy   great guy good man chris Christie Mae we   have incredible support mike huckabee   he's been so great on television he's so   good he's so good he said the other   night Donald Trump won that debate by a   landslide but that doesn't mean the   press is going to report that they all   reported Trump won but Mike Huckabee   said it better he said Trump wanted easy   not even a contest but that doesn't mean   that the CNN's of the world will say   that okay they won't never say it they   will never say if the late great Abraham   Lincoln debated and he was representing   our point of view CNN would say Abe   Lincoln went down to a mass of defeat   I mean these are dishonest people were   dealing with these are very very   dishonest people and it's really a shame   and their ratings are not very good   either that's good you know why because   some people they lose credibility New   York Times is losing credibility   remember they wrote the story about   Trump with women was on the front page   of the New York Times that I was a   little bit lewd lewd but they had the   story few months ago with women and they   put in the front page in here comes and   then the women called and said I didn't   say that I like him a lot he's a great   guy you know from 30 years ago 20 years   ago and 15 years ago and I was so   honored that they had the courage to do   it but the times never gave me a thank   you know any kind of a retraction it's a   disgrace what's going on with the media   is disgraceful and it's happening to all   of us believe me it's happening to all   of us 47 million Americans are living in   poverty and 45 million Americans are in   food stamps this is the legacy of Obama   Clinton my economic reforms on energy   taxes regulations and trade will create   at least 25 million new jobs over the   next 10 years it's going to be   unbelievable I will be the greatest jobs   president that God ever created believe   me   the state of Florida's lost one in four   manufacturing job since NAFTA and China   deals happened thank you love you too   darling it's good I love Florida I love   the people of flower I created many many   jobs in florida many many jobs you have   jobs on Miami Beach doral is a   tremendous success and Mara Lago and the   clubs and we've done all of that he'll   he's done nothing for Florida so and   remember when we were in the primary I   ran against Marco Jeb all these guys and   we had a great Hey look mark has been   very very nice lately and I hope he wins   I do but we won by 21 points remember   that everyone said what happened how   about all of these states you know I   went into a couple of states Trump was   one point down does it look like and   then we win by like 14 points we could   have this happen we're pretty even in   florida and i'm a little disappointed   because hillary hasn't created a job and   I've created thousands of jobs in   florida thousands in at Doral I have   over a thousand people working just at   Doral itself mar-a-lago Trump   International many many jobs buildings   along the beach in Miami now we've   created a lot of jobs so the flora   doesn't if you guys don't vote me as a   victor i'm going to be very angry at you   Hilary doesn't come down to Florida she   comes down to Florida to try and get   your vote than you won't see her anymore   if Hillary Clinton gets in the   manufacturing that's left in Florida   Ohio North Carolina Pennsylvania   Michigan will be shipped to other   countries shipped overseas and go to   Mexico look there's no doubt about that   if I win day one we're going to announce   our plans to totally renegotiate NAFTA   which is a one-way street for businesses   to leave our country   they get the businesses they get the   cash and you know we get we get the   drugs that's what we get we get nothing   we get unemployment and we get drugs the   years of all talk no action politicians   like her will end I'm not controlled by   special interest so i'll immediately   begin to go to work on this that's why   I'm putting up my own money for the most   part other than we're getting massive   amounts of small contributions average   61 dollars you saw the numbers in fact   they're going to be announced tomorrow   set records for a Republican on the   small contributions I love that I love   that and we're doing good we just came   out with a new commercial and crooked   Hillary she's crooked as a three-dollar   bill I used to say a two-dollar bill but   now they make two-dollar bills if we   don't get the deal we want on NAFTA   remember this remember I said it we will   leave NAFTA and start over again and   make a much better deal okay we will   terminate a trump administration will   also stand up to China's product dumping   and currency cheating and the steel what   they're doing to our steel companies is   unbelievable with the dumping we're   going to start making things again in   America we're going to have apple make   their iPhones and make things in this   country not make everything in China and   Vietnam and these other countries   we're going to bring apple and many   other companies they're going to be back   in the United States our jobs we're   going with much lower business taxes   we're bringing the tax rate from thirty   five percent to fifteen percent and we   are going to be booming again our taxes   are so high our taxes are so high that   businesses are forced to leave and by   the way when businesses want to be   ripped out of Florida ripped out of your   community not going to happen anymore   because there's going to be consequences   like carrier air conditioning in the   state of Indiana where Mike Pence by the   way is doing a great job for me do we   like Mike okay so Mike did a great job   he absolutely beat Tim Kaine who who you   know Tim Kaine raised taxes in his first   week when he was governor of Virginia   not a popular governor he raised him by   four billion dollars Mike on the other   hand Indiana you take a look I mean he   has done such a great job so here's my   question to you by cheering who did   better in the debate are you ready for   your gonna get a cheer you're gonna let   me know so I did very well did you see   Hillary today did everybody see the   debate yeah you lost I killed I look   forward next week we have another one I   look forward hey did you see wait wait   wait did you see where she said that I   entered her space so here i am i'm   standing right you saw that this is a   liar so i'm standing at my podium I've   got my chair and crooked Hillary walks   across the stage right in front of me   I'm standing I didn't move right right   so I'm standing as he walks across the   stage he's standing right in front of me   I didn't care I didn't care and she's   answering a question and then she walks   right back okay that's fine I didn't   make a big deal next day I said I read   the paper   she entered my space she entered my   space right but did you see did you see   what she said that I entered her space I   didn't move and I was very careful   because years ago somebody did come in   and talk to her and the poor guy lazio   he got just killed so I said I'm not   getting near this woman no I'm not   getting near this woman at all no   interest no interest I have no interest   but resaw that right so I'm standing   there she walks she stands right next to   me and the next day they said Donald   Trump entered her space these are   dishonest people anyway but next week we   have another debate in Las Vegas so   that'll be fun America if I get elected   will become when when they always go   when went by like that you know kind of   leave you you don't want to sound too   egotistical the polls are pretty even in   Florida you don't let me down don't let   me down honestly don't let yourselves   down maybe more importantly America will   become the great jobs magnet of the   world remember them we're also going to   fix our inner cities and help our Latino   Americans and believe me that's what we   have to do the Hispanics in this country   I've been treated very unfairly the   African Americans have been treated very   very unfairly forty five percent of   african-american youth live in poverty   fifty-eight percent of african-american   youth don't have jobs only forty-one   percent on their own home that's much   much lower than other groups forty-one   percent that's a very low number one of   the lowest more than 3,000 people have   been shot in Chicago since January first   three thousand people so the inner   cities   don't have jobs have a lousy education   right have lousy horrible and they're   unsafe you get shot walking to the store   so I say to the African Americans   suffering in our inner cities what do   you have to lose vote for Donald Trump   what do you have to lose I will fix it I   will do the job and in four years from   now when we have another election I will   win with african-americans and I will   win with Hispanics in very large numbers   we're going to fix it these politicians   have been lying to you for years these   Democrats they've run the inner cities   for up to a hundred years even more   uninterruptedly come for your vote every   four years Hillary Clinton comes for   your vote and you'll get a vote and then   after you get the votes you'll say bye   bye I'll see you in for you she hasn't   do anything she didn't do anything for   New York State remember upstate New York   a disaster she came out and she said an   upstate New York she's going to create   200,000 jobs guess what everybody left   it was like a disaster she was a   disaster and she's a bad person remember   that she's a bad bad person I will fight   harder for you than anyone ever has   fought before and that's why I want to   get the african-american vote and I want   to get the Hispanic vote we're going to   fix your communities we're going to fix   those inner cities for once and for all   we're going to fix them and we're going   to create jobs and great education and   we're going to have safe inner cities   instead of these horrible horrible death   traps and that's what they are   we're going to fight for the Latinos   trapped in poverty that includes school   choice for every low-income   african-american and Latino Hispanic   child and this nation disadvantaged   children will be able to send their kids   to the public private charter or magnet   school of their choice i also have a   message for our wonderful cuban-american   community where any Cupid's here Cuban   Cuban America not too many but I'll say   it anyway all right Obama made a   one-sided deal with the Castro regime by   executive order everything's executive   order because he doesn't have enough   time because he's playing so much golf   he doesn't have enough time to convince   Congress to do it this guy plays more   golf than people on the PGA Tour we will   cancel the Obama order unless we get the   deal that we want including political   and religious freedom for the people of   Cuba we will also stand with our friends   in Venezuela as they struggle for   freedom and Doral is located in a big   community where we have tremendous   numbers of people from Venezuela amazing   people the people of Venezuela and Cuban   know how dangerous corruption is and how   dangers socialism is two more reasons   why we have to keep crooked Hillary   Clinton out of the White House here are   some more amazing things as we finish up   that we're going to do for our country   starting in 2017 would right around the   corner we are going to massively cut   taxes and regulations she is going to   increase taxes substantially we're going   to protect Internet freedom you see   where they want to sell now they want to   have the internet run by the world all   right did you see what Obama wants to do   oh I hope we can stop that deal fast did   you see that wants to give up that   tremendous right we're going to defend   religious liberty   we're going to safeguard a very obsolete   electrical grid from cyber attack cyber   attack is a new big problem we're going   to rebuild our depleted military and we   are going to take care of our great   veterans we have tremendous veteran

of change you know that we will   deliver jobs opportunity and justice for   future generations your generations we   will better believe it I've wanted this   race and you know that to be about the   issues we won by everybody's account the   other night we had a debate with crooked   Hillary and we won that debate and and I   mean I'm not saying that's what   everybody's saying that I felt that we   won the other thing remember when she   walked in front of me and I stood in his   my podium and here's my chair Nolan I'm   standing and she walks right in front of   me and then the next stage he stood   answering a question right and she was   right here and I was right he never   moved and the next day the paper came   and said I invaded her space I said well   what I invaded her space now how we won   that one and we look forward I guess   Wednesday night we have another one with   crooked Hillary and by the way I don't   know if you know the big Wall Street   journal/nbc poll just came out in Ohio   oh we're only one up   [Applause]   you know no you know what and I say that   kitty lee will one up and we got very   unfairly battered by people i have no   idea who these people are I've been   battered by people that I have no idea   who they are but we're one up in the NBC   Wall Street Journal poll which never   treats me good so we'll one up in Ohio   and it just came out in North Carolina   will one up also we're doing well and   she's spent a fortune on ads fortune   here in North Carolina just an absolute   fortune and you know I tell you what   we're gonna have some big surprises this   is going to be brexit all over again   except even bigger guys the Clinton   campaign has refused to discuss the   issues in fact the WikiLeaks just came   out today she's got no core her people   are saying what's a core what's she   talking about what's a core I have a   core you know what it is make America   great again that's my   instead instead of the issues they've   slandered and libeled me with false   accusations but we will not let these   lies distract us from our campaign and   it's a campaign of truth it really is in   an earlier speech today I addressed the   fact that I was falsely accused and I   think possibly some of you have seen it   or watched it it's a disgraceful thing   that you can be on the front page of the   failing New York Times and it is a   failing this paper is third great people   I'm telling you third word bad people   bad people sick people I was on the   front page I think I had three stories   on the front page today three at whoever   heard of three boom boom boom I guess it   sells newspapers unfortunate but don't   worry because the papers going out of   business it's only a question of when   but it's the fairly new york times and   they're inventing false claims without   any evidence no witnesses no nothing   connected supposedly years and years ago   I never met these people I don't even   know who they are they're made-up   stories filed right before the election   right before the election I wonder if   that had anything to do with this right   it's a disgrace I really mean it's a   disgrace I want to talk about policies   affecting our lives but I did want to   mention that we did spend some time   talking about that today it just came   out the sad part is we don't talk about   WikiLeaks because it's incredible but   WikiLeaks just came out with a lot of   new ones and it would be wonderful if   these very dishonest people back there   would talk about it it would be   wonderful it would be   they don't want to talk about it because   they want her in there because they   perpetuate but these are varied not all   but big big percentage very dishonest   people in fact the reason I was late to   the podium was because they weren't   ready we waited for them and I said   let's go up without him who cares but   but my people said no we should wait   till the presses so I'm sorry to keep   you waiting but it's their fault not   mine right now our government has been   taken hostage by global special   interests that will stop at nothing to   drain every last ounce of wealth from   this country for their personal benefit   you're gonna see it the greatest weapon   wielded by crooked Hillary is the media   switch he got she's got nothing else   believe me there's nothing there she   couldn't even pass her bar examination   in Washington DC okay I don't know if   you know that okay Hillary Clinton   failed her bar examination of Washington   DC she got nothing going the WikiLeaks   emails show that the Clintons and the   corporate media are one in the same they   collaborate and they conspire together   this Washington establishment will stop   at nothing to stop all of us and you're   going to see that your young people but   you're going to see that although we do   have one of the most successful real   estate people in the world would you   please stand up look at this guy 55,000   units stand up   a great real estate man actually one of   the best in the country it's good and   from these parts it's very good I'm   proud of you these are the people who   have given us decades of endless wars   producing only death and bloodshed but   no victory without victory can you   imagine Douglas MacArthur can you   imagine General Patton in their grave   right spinning luckys going like this   spinning they can't believe we announced   six weeks before we're going to mosel   did you hear we're going to Mosul in a   few weeks and we're going to attack them   whatever happened to the old adage like   you know you sort of do it like don't   tell everybody you do it let's talk   about the victory after they go on to   vozle they want to go to mosel to get   the leaders of Isis cuz they say they're   in Mosul but they announced that they're   going there for the last three weeks so   the leaders you know they're smart they   left dig on oh these people we have some   real beauties our president is   incompetent I will tell you that is   grossly incompetent   these are the same people although all   he likes to do his campaign why isn't   this guy working on jobs he's   campaigning all the time he's   campaigning or playing golf he plays   more golf that if you were on the PGA   Tour these are the same people who have   flung our doors open for radical Islam   putting us on the same path to France   and to multi generational struggles with   violence and extremism embedded in our   communities you see what's happening   take a look at France take a look at   Germany take a look at certain parts of   Sweden take a look at areas you don't   want to go there these are the people   who have allowed violent international   cartels to invade our country and prey   on our most vulnerable citizens and they   are vulnerable victims like Marilyn   Ferris raped by the illegal immigrant   with a lengthy criminal record and   beaten to death viciously with a hammer   wasn't supposed to be in our country   should never have been they didn't want   to put them out these are the people who   have let our drugs poor and let just   drugs drugs are pouring into our country   from the southern border and they're   poisoning our children hopefully they're   not poisoning you stay away from drugs   stay away from alcohol and stay away   from cigarettes I always tell my kids no   drugs no alcohol no cigarettes evanka   said to me when she's like five she   didn't even know what I was talking   about she said dad you're driving me   crazy with that but every time they want   no drugs no alcohol no cigarettes so you   just remember that but you had a big big   big disadvantage you get hooked if you   get hooked it's hard to get unhooked   puts you at a big disadvantage so just   remember maybe that's the thing you   learn or remember most from what I'm   going to say ok if you want to know the   truth at your age these are the people   who emptied the jobs out of Ohio   Pennsylvania Michigan North Carolina and   all of our state so many of our state's   and ship them to Mexico and other   countries the political power is trying   to stop us are the people who've strip   these jobs right out of our inner cities   trapped   of African American and Hispanic   Americans in impoverishment I mean it   their impoverished you have to see these   inner cities and you've seen them you've   seen them their crime beseech   neighborhoods and left 70 million   American women and children and poverty   or near the brink of poverty at the   center of this assault on American   prosperity is the Clinton campaign these   are her ideas these are they they want   to do they've been running the inner   cities the Democrats and the Democrat   ideas for up to a hundred years and even   more than that unbroken guess what it's   now working and it's very unfair to the   people that have to live there and be   shot when they walk to the store and all   of the things that you read about and   watch every night on television they   don't work for you they don't work for   America they work only for themselves   these are the people we're talking about   including foreign government and foreign   actors Hillary Clinton is a criminal who   destroyed 33,000 emails after a   congressional subpoena was issued so   criminal   she is a criminal you get a subpoena   from the United States Congress and you   say get rid of those emails 33,000   emails were deleted and acid-washed I   would even heard of it they were   bleached it's a very expensive process   people don't use it because too   expensive she used it and then she   hammered her phones right anybody get   rid of your cell phone anybody ever   hammer anybody hammer it anybody know   good that means we have all honest   people in here she ignored hundreds of   requests for security in Benghazi   causing the death of four brave   Americans and then she lied to the face   of grieving parents about the reason for   the attack you remember that she   defended a man who violently and   viciously raped a twelve-year-old girl   by horribly smearing and blaming the   victim and then she laughed about   getting the rapist off the hook you've   seen the tape she was laughing she   thought it was funny the guy who raped a   twelve-year-old girl speaking in secret   to a foreign bank hillary pledged her   support for open borders that means tens   of millions of new foreign workers to   compete against you for your jobs your   wages your future she's selling out the   future of young Americans of all   backgrounds to enrich her donors we   won't let that happen we're not going to   let it happen Hilary and her special   interest allies want to keep children in   our inner cities trapped in failing   schools under a trump administration   disadvantaged children will be able to   attend the public private charter or   magnet school of their choice under   President Obama and Hillary Clinton very   important   and we'll also get rid of common core   and bring education   under President Obama and Hillary   Clinton the national debt has almost   doubled 20 trillion dollar national debt   is a weight around the future of every   young person in this country and every   young person sadly in this room it would   require 120 thousand dollars from every   millennial in the country to pay it off   anybody have 120,000 will make a good   about 50 how about 20 how about two   we'll sell it to you for two the new   debt edit under Obama and Clinton would   have been enough to pay off all of the   outstanding student loans in the United   States six times over think of it yet   not one penny of that new debt has gone   to lowering your tuition and the people   that are going to follow you it's only   getting worse he's right who said that   no I'm not gonna dump that's okay good   nice-looking guy gets it   we made him a little nervous when I said   standard he's a good guy the share of 16   to 28 year olds not in the labor force   has increased a forty-five percent   during the Obama administration   tremendously tremendously bad things   that happen in a trump administration we   will work every day to make America   great again for everybody including   Millennials first we will lower the cost   of college and solve the student loan   crisis it's a crisis very unfair biggest   crisis is you graduate you do well from   great colleges like where we are right   now great colleges but you graduate you   do well you're proud of yourself your   parents are proud of you did no jobs and   no jobs no good jobs tuition at public   four-year institutions was forty percent   higher in the last school year than it   was ten years ago in all Americans a 1.3   trillion dollars in their student loans   think of that 1.3 trillion more than   auto loans credit card debt home equity   I mean nationwide you're talking about   the biggest factor students should not   be asked to pay more on their loans than   they can afford and the debt should not   be an albatross around their necks for   the rest of their lives and that's what   we're going to work that out   we're gonna work it out we're gonna work   it out it'll be a negotiation you know   that there everything's a negotiation   but the art of the deal we're gonna work   it out we're going to work at that big   league but it's very unfair you graduate   you know you graduate from college and   you're starting with like an anchor   around your neck no good it's no good   not fair that's why under my student   loan program we would cap repayment for   an affordable portion of a borrower's   income 12.5 percent would cap it that   gives you a lot to play with and a lot   to do and a borrower's work hard and   make their full payments for 15 years   we'll let them get on with their lives   they just go ahead and they get on with   their lives because it's very very hard   for young people's probably the question   I get more than any other question   outside of defense is which is   catastrophic what's going on with our   you know how we how badly we treat our   or veterans how badly we treat our   military folks but I get asked so much   about student loans and suitable young   Americans deserve the same deal as   federal workers so we will equalize   treatment so everyone can start saving   for their families in retirement by the   time they're 15 years out of college so   start counting 15 years in addition I   will take steps to push colleges to cut   the skyrocketing cost of tuition it's   happening it's happening very unfair   because students are like a conduit they   get the money they give it they get and   is not enough incentive for these   colleges to cut and the costs are going   up mammoth ly much more so than other   businesses and industries and I fully   understand why we're going to do   something about it if the federal   government is going to subsidized   student loans it has a right to expect   that colleges work hard to control costs   and invest their resources in their   students if colleges refuse to take this   responsibility seriously they will be   held accountable including by   reconsidering whether those with euge   endowments deserve to keep those   endowments tax-exempt we have a lot of   power over the colleges and they're not   doing the job of cost-cutting because   they don't have the incentive to costco   because you're paying for it because   you're paying for it some schools are   paying more to hedge funds and private   equity managers than they are in   spending and this is true and they are   spending on tuition and tuition   assistance while taxpayers are   guaranteeing hundreds of billions of   dollars of student loans to pay for   rising tuition costs we want   universities to spend their endowment on   their students not themselves we have to   take care of our students   they need to use that money to cut the   college debt and they have to cut   college tuition they have to do it and   we have to do it quickly much of the   skyrocketing cost of college education   is due to the tremendous bloat in   college administrators and bureaucrats I   know that doesn't happen here but you   know just maybe some places doesn't   happen here does it no no no I'm sure   that but every place else it does   according to the Department of Education   the number of college administrators is   up more than sixty percent since 1993 10   times the increase in tenured faculty   positions federal regulations are   responsible for much of this   administrative bloat and it is blown   Vanderbilt University estimated that it   spends 150 million dollars per year   eleven percent of the university's   budgets to comply with government   regulations big problem regulations in   this country a big problem and by the   way I'm cutting your taxes big lake   nasser hillary is increasing attack so   when you get out and when you get those   good jobs you're also going to be paying   if I'm president a lot less taxes she's   going to increase your taxes very   substantially as president I will   immediately take steps to drive down   College causes by reducing the   unnecessary costs of compliance with   federal regulations so that colleges can   pass on the savings to students in the   form of lower tuition I will also make   it a priority to protect students rights   to free speech on campus do you want   free speech   you'll have   wow wow you like that more than the   lower costs i mean that's impressive   right what's going on that's pretty cool   ashford unit why he just said it you   know why because what say it again   that's a pretty great step pretty good   hey do you want to be my speech writer I   think that would be good story that's   very good that's very very good that's   true we love America we want our country   to be healthy again we want to make   America great again that's been our   whole theme and we want to do that but   that's really well said i want to tell   you stand up let me see you wow good   what is that you're wearing turn around   show the press they won't cover it if   it's negative on Hillary   [Applause]   that's great that's great thank you very   much great good great future in the past   few decades political correctness oh   what a terrible term has transformed our   institutions of higher education from   ones that fosters spirited debate to a   place of extreme censorship where   students are silenced for the smallest   of things you say a word somewhat   differently and all of a sudden you   criticize sometimes viciously we will   end the political correctness and forced   a free and respectful dialogue   we also have to recognize that   traditional four-year degrees and   programs are not the only path to a good   job in a good career we understand that   we will fully support schools that allow   people to learn skills and practice a   trade so young people can have access to   the education that's right for them I   for instance it going when I was in   school we had some students that were   horrible students but man could they fix   an engine of a car or they could fix   things that were so much better than   anybody else they had a great ability   for mechanics from machinery for   operating bulldozers I mean a much   greater ability than others that had   straight a's and physics and math and   all of the other subjects that we all   take and we forget that it's very   important it's a great talent it's a   great skill and we must hold all schools   equally accountable for their   performance I will make sure that   students have the information they need   all about their options they have to   have options before starting school and   for repaying their student loans upon   leaving school and will make it so you   can do it and do it very easily you   watch there's a lot of room for   improvement in this regard currently   students navigate 16 complex repayment   plans you know about that right some of   you eight forgiveness programs and 32   deferment and forbearance options each   of these programs has their own nuances   and qualifications I will simplify this   confusing maze into a single income   based repayment program similar to those   that have proved so popular in recent   years it's a very important   very important we also have to make sure   that those who have graduated college   and those who are soon to graduate can   find a great job to skoo job but I mean   great job right we want great shots we   want good jobs to start a career when   they do a lot of our great jobs are gone   gone to other countries gone to Mexico   gone to China gone to lots of places we   don't have many good jobs anymore many   mothers of course this country are   worried their kids won't find jobs or   any of your mother's worried about that   oh yeah a lot of mothers and fathers you   know and fathers and they're right to be   worried one of the biggest threats is   outstanding and it's really a tremendous   it's a tremendous threat the outsourcing   of jobs for college educated kids are   being sent to other countries and   they're going at a rate that we've never   seen before at the same time companies   are importing low-wage workers on h-1b   visas to take jobs from young college   trained Americans you've been seeing   that and you've been hearing that will   protect these jobs for all Americans   believe me my economic plan including   tax trade regulatory and energy reforms   will create 25 million new jobs and   allow the private sector to grow at four   percent per year right now it's hardly   growing at all   crooked Hillary Clinton is going to   increase taxes incredibly incredibly   unbelievably a tremendous amount while   we cut taxes massively tremendous   deference our plan includes reforms to   protect and expand the sharing economy   startups like uber that have managed to   provide great services for consumers and   to consumers in some cases in some cases   i'm hearing little other things we'll   have to check that out july goober does   everybody like it and create lots of   jobs in the process finally and most   importantly the foundation for a new   prosperity will be rededication to the   constitutional rule of law   a vote for me is a vote for change and a   vote for me is really a vote for you   together we will make America so strong   we will make America so powerful and so   rich together we will make America great   again and I want to thank you and God   bless you you are amazing young people   amazing young people keep up the good   work say hello to your parents okay and   thank you fellas   [Applause]   [Music]   you   [Music]

allegiance is to herself her donors   and her special interests my only   special interest is to you believe me is   to you that's why I'm doing this that's   why I'm doing this the corrupt special   interests have stolen your jobs and   shipped your wealth to other countries   they've betrayed the working class of   this country tomorrow the American   working class will strike back it's   about time real change begins with   immediately repealing and replacing   Obamacare   it's just been announced that Americans   nationwide are going to experience a   massive double digit and triple digit   premium hike over ninety percent of the   counties in New Hampshire are losing   Obamacare insurers next year lots of   luck in your negotiation honestly folks   not going to matter we're going to have   it terminated we're going to have great   health care at a fraction of the cost so   it's not going to matter I want you to   leave here happy tonight premiums   surgeon companies are leaving insurers   are fleeing doctors are quitting and   deductibles are going through the roof   yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down   on Obamacare making it even more   expensive I'm asking for your vote so we   can repeal and replace Obamacare and   save health care for every family in New   Hampshire and in our country   real change also means restoring honesty   to government let's start by getting rid   of Clinton that's the best   [Applause]   by the way did you ever see anything   like happening right now have we ever   seen anything like this four-star   general james Cartwright two weeks ago   for a tiny tiny infraction by comparison   can go to jail for up to five years and   might very well General Petraeus life   was destroyed reputation totally   destroyed for something that was a   fraction of what Hillary Clinton did   what a shame what a shame so said   Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt   person ever to seek the office of the   presidency of the United States she   threatened national security she sold   her office to the highest bidder and   then to cover her tracks she deleted   33,000 emails after receiving a   congressional subpoena   that in itself disqualifies her from   running for president she should be   allowed to run she's being protected by   a totally rigged system I've been saying   it for a long time   [Applause]   you   [Applause]   drain the swamp Hillary has shown   contempt for the working people of this   country her campaign in WikiLeaks has   spoken horribly about Catholics and   evangelicals and so many others   they got it all down folks WikiLeaks   WikiLeaks and what Podesta said about   her bad instincts he said she's got bad   instincts and Bernie Sanders said bad   judgment right so do we want a president   with bad instincts and bad judgment I   don't fix we're going to stand up for   the Catholics and we're going to stand   up for the evangelicals WikiLeaks just   released another debate question Hillary   got another one just one hour ago i said   i have to mention it you know if you go   to West Point or annapolis or the Air   Force Academy and if you get the   questions to a test and if you don't   report yourself they throw you out sad   said to me it's one of the bad things a   lot of my people they say oh let's not   talk about that I should talk about it   donna Brazile got the questions donna   Brazile took those questions and gave   them to crooked Hillary right and killer   II didn't do anything she took the   question and I'll tell you what if I   were Bernie Sanders I wouldn't be too   happy and she probably did it with me   too but did we win those debates or what   wouldn't matter wouldn't matter so she   got those questions she never turned him   in folks remember you dealing with a   very dishonest person my contract with   the American voter begins with a plan to   end government corruption and to take   our country back from the special   interests   I want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment to hear these words from   all of us when we win tomorrow we are   going to drain the swamp   that is something that is something at   the core of my contract is my plan to   bring our jobs back New Hampshire has   lost one in four of its manufacturing   jobs since NAFTA a disaster a deal   signed by Bill Clinton and supported by   his lovely wife Hillary   amazingly America has lost listen to the   seventy thousand factories since China   entered the World Trade Organization   another bill and hillary backed disaster   we are living through the single   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world has never been anything like   this a trump administration will stop   the jobs from leaving american and we   will stop the jobs from leaving New   Hampshire believe me we will stop those   if a company wants to fire their workers   leave New Hampshire and move to another   country and then ship their products   back into the United States through what   will soon be a very very strong and   powerful border   [Applause]   we will make them pay eight thirty five   percent tax on those products and you   know what's going to happen you know   what's going to happen they never   leaving they're saying this thing we   will renegotiate NAFTA stand up to China   and stop the job-killing trans-pacific   partnership as part of our plan to bring   back jobs we are going to lower taxes on   American business from thirty five   percent to fifteen percent we will   massively cut taxes for the middle class   Hillary Clinton is raising taxes very   substantially we will cancel billions   and global warming payments to the   United Nations billions and billions and   billions of dollars and nobody knows   where it goes and nobody knows what it's   useful I know where it goes goes into a   lot of people's pockets that's workers   and we will use that money to invest in   environmental infrastructure in the   United States of America if you don't   mind right and we will rebuild our inner   cities and the african-american   community and the Hispanic community   will love what's going to happen because   the inner cities in so many cases are   like living in hell crime is rampant   horrible you can't walk to a store   without getting shot schools are   terrible as bad as it gets and there are   no jobs we're going to bring back the   jobs we're going to fix the schools and   make them terrific and we're going to   make the inner city safe we're going to   make them safe and as you know the   Democrats for longer than a hundred   years in many cases unbroken chain have   been in charge of the inner cities and   you know what they want they want your   vote then they say see you in four years   folks they do nothing I will fix the   inner cities and I ask you though what   do you have to lose believe me we will   do such a great job what do you have to   lose and we've been doing very well if   you look down in Florida look at those   long lines we have been doing very well   with the african-american community and   with the Hispanic community and all of   the dishonest breasts they're saying   what's going on here what's going on   among the world's most dishonest people   look at all of them oh look at all those   cameras   look at all those cameras why don't you   twirl the cameras folks go ahead twirl   them show the crowd   show the crowd   they don't do it and outside you have   another 10,000 was just reported 10,000   these are the world's bad people to   dishonest people the very very dishonest   but not all of them but I would say most   of them you know you heard you heard the   coach he mentioned it to I guess he's   got his difficulties with them also now   they're very dishonest I will be a   champion for all Americans against this   unfair and corrupt system we will become   a rich nation again but to be a rich   nation we must also be a safe nation   Hillary Clinton wants a five hundred and   fifty percent increase in Syrian   refugees coming into the United States   can't do it folks can tell her plan will   import generations of terrorism   extremism and radicalism into your   schools and throughout your communities   when I'm elected president we will   suspend the Syrian refugee program and   we will keep radical Islamic terrorists   the hell out of our country believe me   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and yes we will build a great   great wall   [Applause]   and don't forget New Hampshire I promise   you I promise you when I won New   Hampshire in the primer I promised you I   said we are going to stop the drugs from   flowing in going to stop them from flow   we're going to stop the drugs from   poisoning your children and plenty of   others we're going to build the wall I   was endorsed by so many people having to   do with the borders the border patrol   agents ice all endorsed Donald Trump   such an honor for me because he's a   great want to do their job but I   promised you that if I got this far you   were the first ones and you were the   first ones that really taught me how bad   the drug epidemic is I met with your   police who are incredible people by the   way and they explained and I guess made   a big impact on me because I Love New   Hampshire I love the beauty of New   Hampshire the trees the winding roads   the lakes the rivers of the whole thing   the little streams so I'd meet with   people and I'd say what's your biggest   problem and they'd say heroin I say   heroin it made such an impact because it   just doesn't seem to work with the   beauty of your area but I said we would   stop it we will stop it 100% and then we   are going to work on helping the people   who is so seriously addicted okay we are   going to do it   Hillary Clinton totally supports open   borders they're ago as your country   which means unlimited drugs pouring into   your state's pouring into our country   Hillary also strongly supports sanctuary   cities like San Francisco where Kate   Steinle was murdered by an illegal   immigrant and deported probably more   than five times we will cancel all   federal funding to sanctuary cities   believe me Oliver we will stop illegal   immigration stop the drugs from pouring   into our country and dismantle every   last criminal gang in cartel threatening   our citizens we will also repeal the   obama-clinton defense II question and   rebuild our badly depleted military we   needed so badly now   this will be a national effort and a   major part of this rebuilding will be   the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard it'll be a   big part of it folks a big part we have   now the smallest Navy by the way does   anyone know this the smallest Navy that   we've had since World War one we're   going to build it back up I'm honored to   have the endorsement of more than 200   top Admirals and generals and 22 medal   of honor recipients and the list goes on   and on and up and up every day Hillary   and our failed establishment have   dragged us into foreign wars that have   made us less safe and that we never win   we never win we fight and fight and   fight like mosel we give them for months   noted we're going into Mosul what about   the element of surprise remember the old   element of surprise we are going to be   attacking mosel in four months we will   hit them from the rear we will hit them   from the front we will parature pen we   will do all sorts of thing then three   months they say again then two months   then one months and a couple of weeks   ago I'm hearing we expect to be   attacking mosel next week these are   smart people one of the reasons we're   attack it is we want to get the leaders   of Isis who we feel a staying in   multiple they left after the first   mention that we're going to attack don't   these people understand it oh what a   bunch of people we have   what a bunch of people I mean we've got   a president all he wants to do is   campaign for crooked Hillary that's all   he wants to do   you know he takes that big that big 747   Air Force One those big old engines that   spew the stuff right and he flies it all   over the place campaigning for Hillary   and then he talks about let's not affect   the ozone layer what a joke what a joke   and he shouldn't be campaigning he   should be out trying to get our jobs   back trying to secure our borders   building up our military stopping our   drug problem   amazing amazing and Hillary can't fill a   room look look at this is called this is   called filling is sated and I have no   guitar and no piano right I mean she   gets jay-z and Beyonce the other night   the language right the language was so   bad people were insulted they started   walking out Hilary then walks under the   stage hug him hug him hug him and then   she says Donald Trump uses such foul   language give me a break did you hear   what he was saying and tonight yes Bruce   Springsteen what they don't say is this   so they perform actually in the case of   jay-z they were leaving consumer did   these people never heard language like   that they started to live so what   happens they come in listen to the   musician which i think is demeaning to   the pit or it's actually demeaning to   the political process they listen   because she can't fill a room she'd come   here she'd have I'm telling you she'd   have a hundred people sitting on the   first one we're going to have we have   28,000 people including the people   outside more than beyonce more than JC   more than anybody and we don't have a   guitar what we do have is we all have   together a great plan to make America   great again that's what we have and also   in all fairness is there any place   better than a trump rally to be I mean   is no place better so these politicians   have shipped our jobs and our wealth all   over the world and left our board is   wide open at home that will change   immediately upon our victory believe me   immediately gotta get out and vote   tomorrow's the day got to get out we got   to get out and vote one thing I'll say   about New Hampshire I've never   disappointed New Hampshire but New   Hampshire has never disappointed me   remember in the primaries they said   Donald Trump the you know the phony   polls is these people like they said   Donald Trump may not win New Hampshire I   said that's surprising i think i'm going   to win i think i'm going to win and then   we won by 18 points with a lot of people   you know we had 17 people you know what   else right next door in Massachusetts   where they're represented ah now I know   why you like Bella checks so much and   Tom Tom Brady by the way is there a   better reference and Tom Brady and Bill   Belichick for the song I don't   I don't think so you know in   Massachusetts we had what 14 people left   they go like this boom boom boom I think   we had 14 people up we got 49 and a half   percent of the vote and these dishonest   pundits said Donald Trump has not broken   50 how do you break 50 when you have 14   people but we won we won Massachusetts   got over forty nine percent   and Massachusetts is represented by   Pocahontas right buck aha   it's represented by Pocahontas   oh she's terrible she is she is just a   terrible person terrible you know   Clinton thinks he's doing yourself a   favor to use this woman as a surrogate   everybody that watches her they say she   is a terrible human being she's terrible   so I don't know who's going to challenge   her but whoever does you know I hear a   very great baseball pitcher is going to   challenge he's a great and you know what   he's a great guy I don't know if he's   going to do it but he's a great guy but   Elizabeth Warren is terrible and you   know what she's a terrible let me tell   you she's a terrible senator take a look   at what she's passed nothing nothing and   in the Senate everybody hates her they   don't won't even deal with her so I'll   make you a deal you can have Pocahontas   I'll take Tom Brady and Bill Belichick   okay   and from now on it's going to be America   first to all Americans I say it's time   for change in time for leadership just   think about what we can accomplish in   the first 100 days of a trump   administration we're going to have the   biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan even   bigger and Hillary is going to raise   your taxes substantially we're going to   eliminate every unnecessary job-killing   regulation we will cancel every illegal   Obama executive order just   he goes out and plays golf so much that   he doesn't have time to convince   Congress to go and let's do it the way   it's supposed to be done right bride I   mean he's played more golf than most   people in the PGA Tour sky like is it   over 300 rounds hey look it's good Golf   is fine but always play with leaders of   countries and people that can help us   don't play with your friends all the   time we are going to protect religious   liberty rebuild our military and we are   going to finally take care of our   veterans properly our veterans properly   our veterans have been very mistreated   and I want to thank them for the   tremendous support and the military the   tremendous support I get they do polls   and it's like forget it it's like I'm   not running against anybody and our law   enforcement has been so great they've   been gone we're going to provide school   choice and put it into common core we're   bringing our education local and we will   support the men and women of law   enforcement great people and save our   Second Amendment which is under siege   and appoint justices to the United   States Supreme Court who will uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   States think of this i started on june   sixteenth long time ago from way back   can you imagine this and now i can

Sxk3-k8tAIc~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160922~Full Speech: Donald Trump Speech at Shale Insight Conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (9/22/2016)~76785.0~4.64233589172~1497.0~147.0~   please welcome to the stage Christine J   Tourette II former chairman and chief   executive officer SW Jack drilling   company a little understand exactly fix   your body and you do what was best for   the country happy opportunity how do you   see this election going either because   you know gentlemen you know the press   also elects gotta take a short break do   we want to make a wish or do we want to   make a choice on one hand we can wish   will have a secure nation with no   borders but we know you need borders to   be a nation in the first place we can   wish our economy will grow more than 2%   when Washington politicians and   regulators are beating down capitalism   and making decisions that the market   should make but we've seen that doesn't   work we can wish that health care costs   will be controlled when the federal   government runs it but again we've seen   that doesn't work do you still have the   physician or the insurance plan you   liked and we're promised that you could   keep we can wish that America continue   to be the greatest nation on earth even   if our leaders are dividing us by income   by race by gender and if you ask me a   divided America is something none of us   ever ask for we can wish that more than   two-thirds of americans polled didn't   say our nation was on the wrong track   but we all know deep down that we need   to get back on a better track the right   track how about wishes and choices in   energy we can wish that the wind and Sun   immediately can be reliable sources of   power generation but ask someone who   knows and they'll tell you it's just   that a wish we can wish that politicians   and others can be so smart and informed   that they can pick and choose our   sources of energy and remove all   environment   risk from energy development and   delivery now that's a wish for those who   grasp a practical reality and it doesn't   exist we can wish for an economic and   geopolitical opportunity that can   replace domestic oil and gas production   consumption and export but it's hard to   imagine what in the world that might be   I think in our heart of hearts Americans   are choice makers we want to assert   ourselves and use the best information   coupled with common sense to make   decisions that we believe will make   things better let's talk about choices   and energy it's a choice to look at a   nation with millions of miles of   underground pipelines of all kinds that   for decades have served our energy needs   our communities and businesses and   families and co-president and government   shutdown a 4.5 billion dollar project in   North Dakota and Keystone before that   now that's when we say to ourselves   there's got to be a better way it's a   choice to look favorably at epic oil and   natural gas technology and innovation   with the potential to dramatically   change our economy to create millions of   opportunities for people to go to work   to take care of their families and to   prosper that's a choice we can all get   behind if we have a leader who will lead   on it it's a choice to question people   who blindly fight against clean-burning   natural gas when it is delivering so   many environmental and economic benefits   to so many people especially low-income   households it's a choice to be the   nation's leader and say from now on we   will all work together to have a   sustainable energy system that's as   environmentally friendly as possible but   we're going to invest in innovation that   makes all energy as efficient affordable   and accessible as it can be for everyone   a leader who would respond to leave it   in the ground by saying   leave your ideology at the door and   let's look at to science and to   engineering address the issues we all   have a choice to make in November I   think I've just begun to make it clear   here today as he will why Donald Trump   won't be wishing for a new direction for   America he'll be making choices that can   make America great again ladies and   gentlemen the next president of the   United States Donald Trump   respected woman I have to say it's great   to be with so many of my friends oh you   will like me so much you will get that   business you know all my life that   business has never had problems but in   the last seven or eight years it's been   tough with the EPA with all of the   different difficulties you going through   you are going to like Donald Trump and   all of the workers that get put to work   they're going to love Donald Trump so   that's good and I just heard from Rocky   Bleier he endorsed me I said can I say   then I said yeah I love tough people and   he's a tough cookie and he he just   endorse us we have great relationships   and you know it's really been something   we've had some great ball numbers come   out just today rasmussen is five up   nationwide and I guess you probably saw   Ohio is doing great with four or five up   the Fox poll came out last night and   doing great pretty much we're doing   great what we have to do great Florida's   been terrific and I think we're going to   have a big big victory right here in the   state of Pennsylvania and I think it's   going to be a picnic food I went to   school here my children went to school   here so it's a very very special place   to me I also want to thank the Marcellus   Shale coalition and Ohio Oil and Gas   Association and the West Virginia oh   that West Virginia what a what a victory   hi there I was almost like running on a   post all of the folks in West Virginia   they have been so great they have been   great right from day one and now it   helped when Hillary made the statement   I'm going to put all those mines and   miners at a business that was not a good   statement to make out of maybe she knows   something I don't know but your   organization's represent tens of   thousands of jobs for hardworking   Americans let me also recognize a really   good friend of mine an amazing guy   Harold Hamm where's Harold he's here   someplace there he is   what a great guy I spent in half an hour   with Harold and tens of dozens of hours   I mean I spent so much time with with   all of these different folks but I   learned more than a half an hour with   Harold Hamm that I made with all of the   consultants put together that i can tell   you but they tell me that a republican   can't carry the state of pennsylvania   where do you see what happens here what   you see and i don't believe it and you   don't believe it and i think you're   going to have yourself not only a   victory but a really big one that's   going to go a long way to tell you what   a wonderful industry you're in I have to   say do whatever you can to get out the   vote November a do whatever you can   because a lot of things are happening a   lot of forces happening whatever you can   so it's great to be at MIT's burg the   Steel City a lot of friends here under a   trump administration we're going to   bring back our steel jobs and we're   going to rebuild this nation so   importantly before going any further   today I want to address the turmoil   unfolding right now in our country and   it seems to be a never-ending problem   America desperately needs unity and it   needs the spirit of togetherness that   has not really only got us through our   toughest times that we've had some tough   times but which has lifted us up in the   past to our greatest achievements as a   nation every day I see people of   different backgrounds working together   for a common good and we need to bring   that spirit to every part of our country   and become one American nation united by   shared values and principles as American   citizens we have to do it and we have to   respect our flag we have to respect our   flag   we all have to walk a mile and someone   else's shoes see things through their   eyes and then get to work fixing our   very wounded country I mean it's we have   some real problems and we do have a   wounded country many Americans are   watching the unrest and Charlotte   folding right before their eyes on the   TV screens others are witnessing the   chaos and the violence firsthand our   country looks bad to the world   especially when we are supposed to be   the world's leader how can we lead when   we can't even control our own cities we   honor and recognize the right of all   Americans to peacefully assemble protest   and demonstrate but there is no right to   engage in violent disruption or to   threaten the public safety and peace of   others every single American in our   country is entitled to live in a safe   community the violence against our   citizens and our law enforcement must be   brought to a very rapid end the people   who will suffer the most as a result of   these riots are law-abiding African   American residents who live in these   communities where the crime is so   rampant it's their jobs housing market   schools economic conditions that will   suffer and the first duty of government   is to protect their well-being and   safety we have to do that there is no   compassion in tolerating lawless conduct   crime and violence is an attack on the   poor and will never be accepted in a   trump administration never ever our job   our job is not to make life more   comfortable for the violent disruptor   but to make life more comfortable for   the african-american parent trying to   raise their kids in peace to walk their   children to school and to get their   children great education we have to   cherish and protect those people for   everyone violent protesters there are   thousands of moms and dads and kids in   that same community who just want to be   able to really to sleep safely at night   to be able to walk on the streets to be   able to go to the grocery store more law   enforcement more community engagement   more effective policing is what our   country needs and we need it quickly   last year we saw a seventeen percent   rise in violent crime in our 50 largest   cities homicides are up nearly fifty   percent in Washington DC and more than   sixty percent in Baltimore more than   3,000 people have been shot in Chicago   so far this year from January first can   you believe then nationwide   approximately sixty percent of murder   victims under the age of 22 are   african-american this is a national   crisis and it's the job of the next   president of the United States to work   with our governors and mayor's to   address this crisis and save African   American lives look at the example   that we had in New York of Mayor Rudy   Giuliani has been a tremendous person   for me a friend of mine for a long time   and a big endorser big big endorsing the   policies he put into place ultimately   brought down crime by seventy-six   percent and murder in New York by   eighty-four percent think of how many   families these policies say from the   worst heartache imaginable we need a   national anti-crime agenda to make our   cities safe again we have to make our   cities safe again we will appoint the   best prosecutors investigators and   federal law enforcement officers in the   country to dismantle the international   cartels gangs and criminal syndicates   and I will stop the drugs from flowing   into our country and poisoning our youth   and many other people   and if you're not aware drugs are a very   very big factor in what you're watching   on television at night my administration   will work with local communities and   local officials to make the reduction of   crime a top priority safety is the   foundation of the ladder to American   success a great education and a really   good paying job we've lost so many of   our good jobs to other countries we're   going to be bringing them back right   here to Pittsburgh to Pennsylvania we're   going to be bringing it back to Ohio   we're going to be bringing them back all   over the country they're coming back   they're coming back these trade deals   and the people I think we'll have to   have Harold Hamm negotiate a couple of   trade deals for as folks to have the   best schools and the best jobs you must   have safe communities that means we must   recognize the contributions of our   police who come from all backgrounds at   all walks of life and who often   thanklessly risk their own lives to   protect innocent people many of whom   they've never met we all remember   earlier this year when officers in   Dallas hunted down for execution   continued protecting the public until   their last moments on earth they were   killed every day police office risked   their lives for really complete   strangers and in every year many of them   will go out on calls and never return   it's tough being a police officer and   it's hard now even recruiting police   officers it's a tremendous profit police   are entrusted with immense   responsibility and we must do everything   we can to ensure that they are properly   trained that they respect all members of   the public and that any wrongdoing is   always and it will be by them   vigorously addressed has to be but our   men and women in blue and you know this   the men and women in blue need your   support they need your thanks and they   need your gratitude they are the line   separating civilians and civilization   from total chaos they are also the front   lines of defense in the war on terror as   we saw recently with their quick action   following the terrorist attacks in new   jersey in New York and the off-duty   police office I mean you saw the heroics   of the off-duty police officers in   Minnesota an amazing job they did   catching this horrible person so quickly   with how do you do that they figured it   out and within a short period of time   they were able to capture me who could   do that that's tougher than finding oil   I will tell you right in addition to   providing safety we must provide   economic opportunity and that begins   with school choice and leads to a secure   job with a rising income this brings us   to the subject of energy producing more   American energy is a central part of my   plan to making America wealthy again   especially for the poorest Americans   I knew I'd have to make that statement   in order to get you guys a little bit   enlivened would you like the rest of   what I'm going to say even more America   is sitting on a treasure trove of   untapped energy some 50 trillion dollars   in shale energy oil reserves and natural   gas on federal lands in addition to   hundreds of years of coal energy   reserves it's all upside for this   country more jobs more revenues more   wealth higher wages and lower energy   prices I'm going to lift the   restrictions on American energy and   allow this wealth to pour into our   communities including right here in the   state of Pennsylvania that we love   according to the Institute for energy   research lifting the restrictions on   American energy including shale   production will accomplish the following   increase GDP by more than 100 billion   dollars each year that's good music in   over 500 thousand new jobs annually   increased annual wages by more than 30   billion dollars over the next seven   years increased federal state and local   tax revenues by almost six trillion   dollars over four decades increased   total economic activity by more than   twenty trillion dollars over the next 40   years in addition we will streamline the   permitting process which probably makes   you happier even than when I'm going to   say well lowering taxes the permitting   process in your industry is a disaster   it's a disaster every friend I have in   your industry they tell me it has become   horrible with the EPA so we're going to   take care of that and all energy   infrastructure projects including the   billions of dollars in projects held up   by President Obama billions and billions   held up creating countless more jobs for   our country in the process overall my   entire economic plan tax reform   regulatory reform energy reform and   trade reform will create at least 25   million new jobs over the next ten years   assuming an average growth rate of three   four five percent and I believe we can   reach beyond actually four percent   growth why not   and just so you know when China does   seven percent or even eight percent it's   a major panic in the country they then   start devaluing of course and they get   their numbers up much to our chagrin my   tax plan includes a 15-percent business   rate think of that so that we're   reducing taxes from thirty-five percent   all the way down for business to fifteen   percent turning America into a jobs   magnet Hillary Clinton would raise taxes   on some small businesses as high as   forty five percent and probably even   higher than that and as far as   regulations are concerned it will be   beyond anything you're experiencing   right now so you better get everybody   out the vote folks so you can further   forget it and all these jobs that we're   talking about will go in the opposite   direction income taxes will be   simplified from seven brackets 23 and   middle-class Americans will get a major   tax cut including child care deductions   and tax free childcare savings accounts   my plan includes the elimination of all   unnecessary regulations and a temporary   moratorium on new regulations not   compelled by Congress or public safety   over regulation is costing our economy   two trillion dollars a year and I think   probably no other business has been more   affected than your business by   over-regulation and one of the things   I've seen despite this massive tax cut   the biggest since Ronald Reagan and   maybe beyond that from 35 to 15 people   are more excited when I talk about the   fact that we're going to be cutting   massively regulations we need   regulations for safety and environment   but regulations are becoming a major   industry right now and we're going to   make it a much smaller industry maybe a   minor industry your regulations are   going to be cut back to a point that   you'll be able to have your businesses   grow your businesses and start new   businesses and you'll never be able to   do that with what has taken place over   the last eight years and I just think   it's a very important thing and what is   it really impressed because people have   actually people in business have   actually felt more strongly about that   even then the tax cut itself so I   understand that very well on energy my   economic plan unlocks our shale oil and   gas and the energy technologies of both   today and tomorrow finally my plan   includes a renegotiation of America's   trade deals and an enforcement of trade   rules to increase jobs and wealth inside   the United States we have people right   in this room that could do so well for   us we have negotiators of our trade   deals who are political hacks who are   people that don't know the first thing   about negotiation of course you could   just look at the Iran deal and you   understand that the deal was made   recently with Iran what a deal that is I   mean we have half of this room could   have negotiated a deal ten times better   and a lot of the people in the room just   wouldn't have made the deal and that   would have been a lot better   but they did something that you folks   even harold hamm never saw before we   thought it was 400 million in cash cash   not like a check four hundred million in   cash it was 1.7 billion in cash and even   you you've never seen 1.7 cash read   we're talking about cash Harold man one   point there to take airplane like this   airplane I don't even see how an   airplane even a big one is big enough of   that I would like to see that someday   1.7 billion in cash but it had nothing   to do with the hostages right strong   border controls will also protect our   workers and save our budget trillions in   the long term it is perhaps the most   pro-growth economic plan anywhere in   American history I think it is compared   to that to my opponent she plans a 1.3   trillion dollar tax hike massive new   regulations and some of your industry is   sitting right in this room are out of   business the offshoring of American jobs   and the aggressive restriction of   American energy production her plan will   help only her wealthy donors and global   special interests who benefit from the   rigged system and we are in a root   system Hillary Clinton wants to put the   coal miners out of work been hydraulic   fracking in almost all places an   extensively restrict and ban energy   production on public lands and in most   offshore areas that's what she said   remember she said we're going to put the   miners out of work this will produce   devastation for states like Pennsylvania   Ohio West Virginia and so many others   where shale oil and chill energy and   calls and coal production are critical   parts of the economy and I go to the   coal areas and it's like devastation and   these are amazing people   unbelievable people her plan hurt states   like Colorado Florida Virginia North   Carolina and anywhere with access to   either onshore or offshore energy   resources she also supports blocking the   energy infrastructure that's needed to   move our energy resources to the   marketplace according to The Wall Street   Journal overall more than a dozen fossil   fuel projects worth about thirty three   billion dollars have been either   rejected by regulators or withdrawn by   developers since 2012 only with billions   more tied up in projects still in   regulatory limbo they won't happen even   now one president will happen quickly I   can tell you that happen very quickly be   amazed how quickly that examples of   energy transportation projects blocked   or append include an 850 million dollar   coal export facility in Washington a   three billion dollar natural gas   pipeline in the Northeast and a 6.8   billion dollar liquid natural gas export   facility among others many others   billions of dollars in private   infrastructure investment have been lost   to the obama-clinton restriction agenda   and many many billions more to follow   the platform produced by Hillary   Clinton's party this year also calls for   a price on carbon that's just political   speak for a massive new tax on coal and   Chael production a tax on American   consumers and it's very unfair to our   country and it makes it very unfair and   very uncompetitive to do business with   other countries very it makes it so   tough to compete with other countries   and remember   every energy dollar that isn't harvested   here in America is harvested instead in   a foreign country often foreign   countries not very friendly to us that   not only means so true that not only   means that we're sending our jobs to   those countries but it means that energy   is being produced in foreign countries   that lack our high environmental and   conservation standards which we want to   keep that is just one more reason why we   should pursue the safe and responsible   production of America's vast energy   resources and reserves we need an   American first energy plant it's going   to be from now on America first   this means opening federal lands for oil   and gas production opening offshore   areas and revoking policies that are   imposing unnecessary restrictions on   innovative new exploration technologies   the development of the marcellus and   utica shale and I know so well I'm up in   New York State what a shame what a shame   will fund it what you understand there's   probably one guy from New York over   there he's barely he's he's been trying   to get at that stuff for about 20 years   and now his clap he's barely back here   who's the poor guy that just left you   can stand up let me come on give him a   hand get my head   he's exhausted but he's still there   right will fundamentally change the   economic landscape of this region and   our country bringing extraordinary new   prosperity to millions more jobs higher   wages a larger tax base and dollars   flowing into our country for a change   instead of out of our country which is   typical Hillary Clinton's word energy   will cost our economy five trillion   dollars at least she's not only declared   war on the miners but on all oil and   natural gas production it's war which   supports 10 million jobs in the United   States and you people know it's work   it's going to be worse under her then   it's been under President Obama access   to low-cost liquid natural gas also   supports the american chemical industry   which supports 40,000 jobs in the state   of pennsylvania we have just begun as a   nation to recognize our economic   advantage that is made possible by shale   energy the shale energy revolution will   unleash massive wealth for American   workers and their families at the same   time this energy revolution will produce   new to mend for American steel and that   means the steel workers will benefit and   the steel workers today are having a   very very hard time that business is   going down on a yearly basis we are   going to benefit the steel workers and   the steel business but federal   restrictions remain a major impediment   to both shale production specifically   and energy production in general   currently less than ten percent of the   federally managed surface and mineral   estates are leased for oil and gas   development almost ninety percent of our   nation's offshore acreage is off limits   to energy production in many cases is   absolutely no reason for that our energy   policy will make full use of our   domestic energy   sources including traditional and   renewable energy sources we want   everything that means we will end the   war on coal and the war on our miners I   will rescind the coal mining lease   moratorium which is a horrible   moratorium and so unfair the excessive   Interior Department stream rule and   conduct a top-down review of all   anti-coal regulations issued by the   Obama administration we will eliminate   the highly invasive waters of the u.s.   rule and scrap the five trillion dollar   Obama Clinton Climate Action Plan and   the clean power plan these unilateral   plans will increase monthly electric   bills by double digits without any   measurable improvement in climate   whatsoever very unfair to our people and   our workers I will refocus the EPA on   its core mission of ensuring clean air   and clean safe drinking water for all   Americans that's what we want   I believe firmly in conserving our   wonderful natural resources and   beautiful natural habitats my   environmental agenda will be guided by   true specialists and conservation not   those with radical political agendas   that are putting our country behind the   8-ball it will be a future of   conservation of prosperity and of great   success for the people in this room and   for all of those people that you employ   the tens of thousands of great people   that you employ it will be a future of   new technology new innovation and new   solutions it will be a future we can   achieve together beginning with a   victory on november eighth get out and   vote   we will make America wealthy again we   will make America safe again and we will   make America great again thank you very   much thank you god bless you thank you   thank you everybody thank you   [Music]   [Music]
t57g0HtH_G4~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160906~FULL: Donald Trump Town Hall with Gen. Flynn in Virginia Beach, VA (9/6/2016) Trump Live Speech HD~17656.0~4.80582523346~392.0~20.0~   it's a big room thank you very much okay   [Applause]   how's Virginia Beach doing today okay we   have a we have a busy hour up coming   here we are going to go through a whole   range of questions about our military   about our veterans about our national   security a whole range of stuff today so   this will be a really good event and we   do deeply deeply appreciate everybody   coming out today this is a really   important period of time for our country   thank you okay I know that there's a   whole bunch of groups here one I do want   to recognize are they the military   spouses that are here today if you could   just sound off yeah exactly thank you so   much for your service your sacrifice and   all that you do thank you so much okay   so the the format here just briefly I'm   gonna just give a just kind of an   opening on the on what's going on around   the world today and then get right into   a series of questions we'll talk again   about kind of the situation in the world   and what is happening around the world   and then how that affects our national   security and certainly how that affects   our military and our military readiness   etc I think everybody knows that the   world is is in one of the most complex   States that it has ever been in when we   think about what's going on in China and   the South China Sea   we've got North Korea and North Korea   moving towards a nuclear program we have   Russia pushing on the frontier of East   Europe we have the Middle East North   Africa Central Asia is just an utter   disaster actually I can't describe it   any other way then it's just a complete   mess and we are facing probably one of   the most complex times that our nation   has ever faced so one of the things that   I want to do is I want to talk first   about our veterans and I want to jump   right in before we   into some of the situation with Isis and   China and all these other things I want   to talk and ask the next president   United States here at Donald Trump who   is just exactly   so so as as as president as president as   the next president what can you do to   reform the Veterans Administration and   the healthcare for our vets how can we   take better care of our vets well   general thank you very much for being   here   like we really appreciate it and we   really appreciate all of those generals   and admirals that today endorsed me we   have a tonight yes at the fighters it's   unbelievable it's 90 these are our   fighters these are fighting generals and   and they're actually a lot more to come   but I really appreciate everything from   you and all of them we have great   respect for those people these are great   great people so if you look at the   veterans situation I have been so   involved over the last year and a half   and before that in seeing what's going   on with the VA and it is a disaster and   I've become so friendly and helped the   veterans in so many different ways but   it's such a big problem and we have no   clue Hillary Clinton said everything's   working just fine she doesn't know that   people are standing on line for seven   days to see a doctor and dying like   they're dying on line and we came out   with a plan a 10-point plan and it's on   the website and you'll see it if you   want most of I'm sure most of you have   already seen it but it's been really   praised by the veterans and the veterans   groups and the fact is the VA the VA is   a the Veterans Administration and   waiting and all of the problems and you   do have some good doctors in there but   people can't get to see the doctors   because the administration the   bureaucratic workings of the Veterans   Administration are a total disaster and   what I've done and what I've looked at   and you know all about the rate of   suicide and all of the problems and   numbers that honestly are not even   believable when you hear 22 people a day   22 people a day these are numbers that   you wouldn't even think are believable   and a lot of it is because of the fact   that they can't get better they can't   they have no service whatsoever and it's   been really really badly and one of the   things that I've done is we allow when   that weight is so long and so horrible   and sometimes by the way a simple   procedure or a simple prescription just   a very simple thing can   person's life wonderful health-wise and   they can't see the doctor they can't get   to see the doctor and we have a plan   what you're gonna leave you're gonna go   across the street or down the road or a   few miles away you're gonna see a doctor   hey you're gonna see a doctor a really   good doctor you're gonna get taken care   of 100% or you're going to go and you're   going to go to a local hospital whether   it's public or private you're going to   get taken care of and your government is   gonna pay your bill and you're gonna be   all set it's going to be very good   promise that's great should have been   done a long time ago and along that line   specifically because you've talked about   this with female veterans and I think   it's just as very very important because   of the the size of the scale the number   of females that we now have in our   military serving as volunteers talk a   little bit about what you have described   as how you would take care of them   the female veterans have been like the   Forgotten people and I think it started   because it was you know obviously a   while ago there were far fewer and they   haven't increased that capacity and now   you have tremendous numbers of female   vets and we are going to do procedures   that they've never done and but we are   going to help the female veteran they   have not been helped they've really been   left behind even more so than our male   veterans they've been left behind and   it's just not gonna happen we're gonna   straighten it out we're gonna give them   also the right if if things are not   being done right they're going to have   the right to go to a local doctor or   physician or a local hospital and again   whether it's public or private whichever   one is most convenient than whichever   one is better frankly and they're gonna   get themselves taken care of whether   it's male or female and that's so   important and the other issue that's so   important is health is mental health   because the mental health problem is   such a massive such a massive problem in   the VA and that's something we're going   to devote a tremendous amount of time to   and it's not just amount of money you   know the money they're spending is is   tremendously it's a it's a huge amount   of money that they're currently spending   but there are people that are   incompetent in the VA tremendous and   they have people that are stealing   you've seen that well if you look at   Phoenix and what's gone on in Phoenix   where they can't even fire the people   they found people that are stealing and   found people that are very dishonest   they can't even get rid of them all of   that's going to change the VA you're   gonna be so proud of what you have I   mean you we're gonna take it and you're   gonna be so proud of that you have   believed me   yeah and and just to highlight one of   the things that you have talked about is   accountability of the people that are   serving our veterans in the Veterans   Administration and the Veterans   Administration system the whole system   and I think that I think for all of us   accountability is probably something not   just in the Veterans Administration but   in government as a whole okay so we're   gonna switch topics a little bit we're   going to talk about some of the refugee   policies now that we see bubbling   underneath us here coming into this   country some of the challenges that we   face what what do you think of Hillary   Clinton's current refugee policies and   how do they differ from your own look   she's a disaster in so many different   ways folks   [Applause]   I don't even I don't really even think   she believes it herself you know she was   brought so far left she was brought so   far left by Bernie and the group and and   I think we're gonna get a lot of the   Bernie people because of trade if you   want to know the truth   a lot of the Bernie people are coming   with us because the one thing he was   right about is the fact that our country   is being ripped off like never before on   these trade deals that are disasters   NAFTA has been a disaster for the United   States it's destroyed our country and   that's one thing he got right and a lot   of people liked him because of trade   more so than anything else but when it   comes to immigration first of all she   thinks that everything is more or less   fine she wants to allow six hundred and   fifty percent increase over and above   what Obama's allowing to come in from   Syria and the Middle East six hundred   and fifty percent and he's already   allowing thousands and thousands of   people in and we don't know where   they're coming from you people know   because we're military people we don't   know where they're coming from   we don't you see the damage that one   person can do you just have to look   anywhere you see the damage that whether   it's Orlando or whether it's two people   that just got married or they're married   and they're you know from San Bernardino   you see San Bernardino they're getting   thrown a party a shower party or a baby   party and then a short while later they   go and they kill 14 people in the group   look we got problems folks we have to   figure it out and if we don't figure it   out we have to be careful and vigilant   and strong and she wants to allow a five   hundred and fifty percent increase you   know I was very interesting I was saying   she wants to allow five hundred percent   more coming in from that region and the   press said I was wrong I said oh what's   the real number five hundred and fifty   so that time it was they said the number   was local as long as they can prove you   wrong the happy no but five hundred and   fifty percent increase of people coming   from Syria in that part of the world and   we can't do it I want to build safe   havens and we'll have other people build   them by the way other people fund them   will lead the charge but you know   Barack Obama has has doubled during his   fairly short period of years he's   doubled our national debt doubled it   it's gonna be close to 20 trillion   dollars when he leaves 20 trillion   dollars so we have to get rid of at   least a good portion of that so we're   gonna have other people we're gonna have   the Gulf states pay for this because   we're gonna build safe havens I mean   look we all have big hearts we just   can't allow these people into our   country until we find out what's going   on we can't do it and I think that also   as you have said that they also impact   our health care system they impact all   the other costs so it's very very   important by the way you have illegal   immigrants I hate to say this in this   room because you have a lot of vets in   the room but you have illegal immigrants   that she wants and he wants treated   better than veterans you have these   people are treated better than people   that are in this room you know it they   are treated better than veterans and let   me tell you folks they got their   priorities mixed up that's gonna change   so fast okay it's gonna change general   we have a couple of people by the way   Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York who what   a great boy   Rudy do we love what he did he took a   city that was a disaster he took New   York City and he made it great think of   it made it great again right he made it   great again so Rudy great to be to see   you and Eric Trump's wife Laura is here   and she's done a fantastic job Laura's   been working very hard in particular in   North Carolina but helping also with   Virginia we have some people in Virginia   and micro-b know in the group they have   done they've been amazing and hopefully   we get everybody registered because we   have to win Virginia is a very important   state we have to win with you thank you   okay so speaking of disasters the Iran   nuclear deal and Iran Iran has I mean   we're talking about putting nukes into   the hands of an Ayatollah that says   death to America death to Israel and   they continued to fire ballistic   missiles all the time in violation of   this deal but Iran has engaged in in   growing hostilities has increasingly   shown it continues to have nuclear   ambitions and as president what are you   going to do about Iran first of all if   you look at the policies of Hillary   Clinton and Barack Obama they have   created what will be a world power not   you know they're talking about a   regional power that's going to be a   world power they have become rich they   have become powerful the deal is one of   the worst negotiated deals of any kind   that I've ever seen if you look at it   just study it we give them a hundred and   fifty billion dollars how about the four   hundred million dollars in cash that we   gave them floating in obviously for   hostages that was the big lie also just   like Obamacare was a big lie this was a   big lie and   404 not think of it 400 million dollars   in cash and they kept the hostages   remember it had nothing to do with the   hostages but the hostages weren't   allowed to leave the airport until such   time and then they came who ever heard a   four hundred million dollars in cash   different denominations different   countries they want all different money   from different countries who even has   the power to authorize something like   this so what we've done is created a   monster we've created in three years   four years if you look at if you take a   look at Iran from four or five years ago   they were dying they had the sanctions   the Chiang said they were being choked   to death and they were absolutely dying   they weren't even going to be much of a   threat they didn't have anything going   and now there are power we've made him a   power overnight we've made up a power   number one they're highly threatening to   the State of Israel they are so bad for   Israel Obama has been so bad for Israel   but they are great threat and they're a   threat to us and they're gonna have   nuclear weapons and this path in my   opinion is going to be a quicker path to   nuclear weapons the deal is grossly   incompetent and then I don't know if you   saw the other day we have the little   boats going out and they're making all   sorts of horrible gestures you know they   learned the gestures I guess they   studied the United States and they gave   those kind of gestures to our sailors   and our captain on the boats and oh boy   I'll bet those guys want to blow them   out of the water I'll bet   I'll bet you they wanted to blow so you   see these four little boats circling   circling going around you know taunting   taunting it's like they've been in bold   and here we are we made a deal that's   such a great deal for them and they now   feel power they feel power remember the   sailors the ten sailors who were a   little bit off they were in the water so   instead of saying hey you're on our   water please you know go over there they   they humiliated our country they   humiliated those ten people and this and   the owners that we got them back of   course you would have gotten them back   very fast if I was president that I can   tell you but the only reason the only   reason we got them back was the payment   the following day was due a lot of the   money the following day was due and   stupid they're not and they wanted to   get that but just think of what's going   on here we are we made this deal we just   we made them a power and we also happen   to have given him Iraq because Iraq you   know I always say Iraq and Iran were   very similar militarily and they'd fight   fight fight and then they dressed at   fight fight fight and then Saddam   Hussein would do the gas and somebody   else would do something else then rest   we knocked out the one and a lot of   people don't realize that Iraq has some   of the greatest oil reserves anywhere in   the world and so Iran is going to get   whatever Isis doesn't already have and   probably take that too by the way what   we've done to create a major major power   through really stupid leaders stupidity   is just shocking it's one of the dumbest   deals I've ever seen John Kerry's a   terrible negotiator but somebody   but don't forget this was a deal this   was a deal that crooked Hillary Clinton   wanted she wanted this deal this was a   very important deal and she wanted that   deal and most people don't even get it   you know normally you understand the   deal you say yeah I understand we get   this way we get nothing we get nothing   this was a deal at the highest level of   incompetence the deal with Iran was at   the highest level of incompetence so   will will will solve that problem if I   get the chance believe me and if I get   the chance you'll be very happy you'll   be right the leads and just to remind   people Iran Iran just to remind   everybody Iran is still designated by   the United States State Department as   the leading state sponsor of terrorism   and we've put them on a path to a   nuclear weapon so pretty amazing what   we've done Stan staying in the same   region because this is something that   all of us that have served in the Armed   Forces over the last 15 years have been   a part of and that is fighting al Qaeda   in Iraq now fighting Isis and Isis   continues to expand their operations   there they have this caliphate that   they've established in Syria and parts   of Iraq and they have launched attacks   throughout the West I think it's the   latest count was somewhere between 22   and 25 countries that they have launched   attacks in the last you know probably   two to three months and that has   resulted in somewhere between seven to   ten thousand casualties around the world   just a stunning display of capability by   Isis what what is your response to Isis   what do you believe we should be doing   well first of all it wouldn't have   started if we had proper leadership   because what happened   we shouldn't have been in Iraq but we   shouldn't have gotten out of Iraq the   way we got out we're literally they   announced we're gonna leave by a certain   date I mean the enemy couldn't even   believe it actually a lot of people   thought it was a little bit of a   deception because they couldn't believe   anybody would say it turned out to be   true   and we should have left a small force   relatively small force as much as I   didn't want to be there we should have   left a small force and really Isis just   evolved out of all of the turmoil all of   the weakness all of the stupidity of   decisions from Hillary Clinton from   Barack Obama and Isis started off in a   small area and now I read the other day   there in 28 different states or nations   28 think of it so they're spreading   rapidly a report came out where they   were told within the government that   they want to try and minimize Isis and   minimize but the fact is they know it's   actually gotten very much out of control   and we have to do something about we   can't allow the chopping off of heads   the drowning of people in steel cages   the viciousness the violence that we   have to knock out Isis we have to knock   them out good you know we have to get   countries that are affected by Isis I   mean a lot of people say as an example   Russia you know Hillary likes to play   tough with Russia Putin looks at her and   he laughs okay he laughs Putin Putin who   looks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles   boy would he like to see her that would   be easy because just look at her   decisions look how bad her decisions   have been virtually every decision she's   made has been a loser but but wouldn't   it be nice honestly cuz Russia Russia   doesn't like Isis any better than we do   would it be nice if we actually got   along with Russia and you could not come   out together and that'd be a good thing   as opposed to you know tough talk she   tries to do the tough talk and then she   leaves you know she goes and I watched   it yesterday on the airplane and talking   tough about Russia then she turned   around and sat down you know which by   the way wasn't even played on the   national media wasn't that incredible   wasn't even played so   we have to get along with people we have   to get along with certain nations very   importantly because it would be awfully   good to have Russia and others with us   on major attacks on Isis and to stay to   stay on Isis a little bit because this   is a really I think this is an important   topic and it's certainly at the it's   it's one of the national security   threats that our country faces today you   have described at times different   components of a strategy military cyber   financial and ideological can you just   expand on those for a little bit well   that's it and you know cyber is becoming   so big today it's becoming something   that a number of years ago a short   number of years ago wasn't even a word   and now the cyber is so big and you know   you look at what they're doing with the   internet how they're taking recruiting   people through the internet and part of   it is the psychology because so many   people think they're winning and you   know there's a whole big thing even   today's psychology where CNN came out   with a big poll that big poll came out   today that Trump is winning it's good   psychology dinner I know that for a fact   because people that didn't call me   yesterday they're calling me today so   that's the way life works right but I   think we're doing very well and I really   thank the state of Virginia so many   different places have been so incredible   so I thank you very much but but cyber   has been very very important and it's   becoming more and more important as you   look and a lot of it does have to do   with ideology and psychology and lots of   other things you know we're in a   different world today than we were in   twenty years ago and thirty years ago   and one of the biggest problems and one   of the reasons that we have to knock   them out is because the weaponry is so   powerful today you know in the old days   you could have said well look they have   rifles we have rifles we shoot and they   have uniforms we have uniforms there's a   whole different war the weaponry is so   powerful and we have to beat them over   there we're allowing people to come over   here we're allowing think of it your   military people we're allowing people to   come over here   you know I used to watch the migration   and I'd see people with cell phones I   said where do they get cell phones and   some of those people had very horrible   things on their cell phones including   the ISIS flag and you say what are we   doing what are we doing   but we're allowing people to come here   and we don't know do they turn on us are   a small percentage of them bad because   of a small percentage is bad that's not   acceptable that's not acceptable we   can't take the risk   just a small percentage can do such   damage so we can't take the risk so   general the bottom line is we have to   get very tough and we have to get very   smart or we're not gonna have a bunch of   a country left I can tell you that right   now good so and staying in there in the   same region of the world because there's   so much going on and it is just   unraveling in front of our eyes and this   really has to do with Syria and there's   been a bunch of this different   discussion about what to do with Assad   do you support regime change in Syria   look we have a problem   it's called Isis Isis is fighting Syria   now we've built up Iran to be a big   power Iran is on the side of Assad Syria   Russia is on the side of Assad Syria so   we built these people up we built we   created this this strong power in Iran   which seriously folks you know better   than anybody four years ago they were   dying   they were gasping for air and what we   had to do is let him sit for a little   longer in fact double up your sanctions   you wouldn't have had you could have   really negotiated a deal how carry never   left that deal was incredible   everybody knew it was bad they're   dancing on the streets all over Iran and   literally they're all celebrating you   know shouting death to America the dumb   Americans that what they're saying is   incredible they're saying death to   Israel this is in the middle of the   negotiation if I had a negotiation like   that I said let's check this negotiation   something's not going very well we just   kept going right through he never left   the table once if he would have left   that table and said I'm sorry you   first of all we should have gotten our   hostages back before we started the   negotiation okay 100% and we should have   said very nicely with respect sorry   folks until you do it and then you leave   the room because they're gonna say no   we're not giving you a hostage back see   that's okay don't worry about then you   get up you leave you get back to your   plane you double up the sanctions they   will call you before you arrive back in   Washington or wherever you're going turn   the plane around in midair your hostages   are coming back okay not 400 million in   cash that we have to give believe me and   it's and it's a hundred percent it's a   honey it's not like 99 percent it's a   hundred percent you leave you say very   nicely I always tell my you know the   story of my father who was a very good   negotiator he taught me so much and he'd   say are you listening to this Ivanka but   he'd say son he thought I was too tough   with things right did say son take the   lumps out do you ever hear this story   take the lumps out my father friend said   just nice and easy nice and easy   just relax take the lumps out and so I   was thinking see in the old days I would   have said we're not giving you anything   you know I would have made the room very   angry now I just say sorry we owe 20   trillion dollars we don't have the money   we can't do it we can't do it with   Caesar we don't by the way how do we pay   them all this we keep the 150 billion   but with the hostages you say we have to   have it back look our people want the   hostages your people don't care that   people probably didn't even know   they did because they played up the   hostages because that's a sign of you   know the big brave Iran so what happens   is you say we have to have the hostages   back they will say no you leave the room   and you double up the sanctions within   48 hours you'll have your hostages back   believe me but they didn't do that Kerry   never walked the only time he walked is   when he entered a bicycle race can you   believe this guy 73 years old that's   true he fell off his bicycle and he   broke his leg and he was out of the   negotiation for three or four weeks and   they probably did better in the   negotiation when he wasn't there that's   the only time that he left he should   have left the negotiation and doubled up   the sanctions and get what he want that   deal is a disaster for us it's a shorter   road to nuclear weapons and it's an   incompetent Lee negotiated deal so these   are the things that we're stuck with   folks but we will fix them great and   staying in the sort of the wider trans   region because this is another important   aspect because it is a place where   members of Isis now come in to Europe   they come in to the United States and   this really has to do with Libya so   since 2011 with the removal of Qaddafi   Libya has turned into a safe haven for   Isis it is also one of the one of the   shipment points for some of these   refugees that are leaving coming into   Europe and into the United States what   would you do in Libya to defeat Isis and   just talk a little bit about your your   commander in chief philosophy for how   you would deal with this well it's more   of the same I'm in just another place   they've taken over and this was a   Hillary Clinton deal we could have done   a minor attack you know he was begging   he wanted to make a deal he wanted to do   whatever and you this was just Gaddafi   was so strong and wanting to you know   because he knew what was gonna happen   but she was unyielding and frankly lip   it's a total disaster Libya right now   you know they have among the finest   quality oils anywhere in the world   their oil is so valuable so good and you   know who's got a lot of that oil right   now Isis Isis has it so we knock them   out and Isis now is all over Libya and   they've taken over the oil remember I've   been saying this for years   keep the oil shouldn't have been there   if you get out keep the oil and we   should have kept the oil and we didn't   we didn't keep the oil anywhere we got   out we spent you know I've been saying   two trillion for years I know one thing   it's now I'm hearing four trillion I   mean you look at what we've spent four   to five trillion dollars in the Middle   East and think of it what do we have   less than what we had 15 years ago it's   a disaster it's a total disaster on top   of which you have the migration which is   destroying Europe look at Merkel   I mean what happened to her the other   day and the election is incredible and I   knew that was gonna happen I mean how   could what she's supposed to be popular   Germany is a disaster now France is a   disaster   I have friends they love you know the   City of Lights right I said to one of my   friends the other day so how is Paris   this summer always goes to said I don't   go there anymore he said it's not the   same place it's a totally that's not   Paris anymore we're destroying our   planet we're destroying what's going on   we're destroying ourselves and you look   at the election results from Merkel they   were so bad and people say oh I think   she'll be okay I don't think she'll be   okay I was saying two weeks I said why   would she be okay   millions of people go into Germany the   crime is unbelievable the problems   they're having is unbelievable and   Hillary Clinton wants to be the Merkel   of the United States okay I don't think   so I don't think it's gonna happen I'll   tell you what I don't think it's gonna   happen I want to I want to stay on this   issue because this is important we still   have an awful lot of troops deployed in   this what I would describe is this   perpetual state of conflict over in Iraq   in Syria Afghanistan and elsewhere and I   think Americans I know Americans are   just they're weary of this endless war   so we right now specifically we have   about 5,000 troops in Iraq and in some   cases supporting the Kurds I think   through Hillary Clinton secretary Kerry   and the Obama administration over the   last eight years they really have not   developed any kind of coherent strategy   what would you do   as commander-in-chief well first of all   as I predicted years ago   Rann is really controlling Iraq and   they're in there now and they have we   have just you know they've wanted it for   decades and decades and decades they've   wanted it and we gave it to him we gave   it to him   because you had two militaries that were   equal I was saying before they fight   fight fight they rest they fight fight   fight they move ten feet this way ten   feet this way they go home and rest   we've handed it to him on a silver   platter you know when I say about the   deal that we made for them or with them   on you know on the whole you know the   hundred and fifty billion dollar deal I   always said that's one of the best deals   I've ever seen not really the best deal   is we have given them Iraq with among   the largest and finest oil reserves in   the world we've given that to around   we've handed it to him what we've done   is incredible if we would have if our   presidents would have just stayed home   and gone to the beach or even gone out   and played golf every single day played   two rounds a day okay which Obama almost   does but   I mean I think he's played three look   Golf is wonderful I think he's played   three hundred rounds ago for something   like that more than 300 that's more golf   than many members of the PGA Tour okay   so look it's a very serious problem but   honestly if they would have just done   nothing we would have been a much better   shape I forget about much better shape   but wouldn't even be close the Middle   East now is a total catastrophe between   the migration and all of the problem and   all of the death and I'm talking death   on both sides folks I'm talking death on   both I look at the people you know they   blow up a city and they say two people   were wounded all right you know the real   numbers okay the real numbers are   astronomical astronomical and we started   this whole thing and I'll tell you what   we are going to solve the ISIS problem   but we have to also get back and we have   to solve it big league and strongly and   swiftly but we have to get back to   rebuilding our country because our   country is going to hell our   infrastructure is a disaster   our roads our bridges our tunnels our   hospitals our schools I mean we'd go   into Afghanistan and build a school   they'd blow it up we'd build it again   they'd blow it up we'd build it a third   time it's still there barely and yet if   we need a school in Virginia or we need   a school in Brooklyn New York or we need   a school in Iowa   there's no money okay there's no money   what are we doing what are we doing so   one of those things yeah and I think   that you know the real issue and you you   have hit on this quite a bit is how our   homeland security and the things that we   do here and domestically you know impact   everything we do overseas as well and I   think vice versa so one thing general I   have to say the people in our military   are amazing they're amazing the people   and   we don't take care of them properly   because the vets are not being taken   care of and we don't take care of them   in the field either because the   equipment is old and tired and you know   a friend of mine has a son who's been in   Iraq for quite awhile you know going   back and forth to different places over   in the Middle East and the thing that I   talked to him he's a fine young man   and hasn't been wounded badly I don't   think he's been really you know very   much affected in that way but he said   the thing that is most discouraging to   them over their soldiers is when he   looks at the other side having better   equipment than they do because you know   we give the equipment to people that we   think are on our side and then a bullets   fired and everyone drops their weapons   and runs and they come and pick up the   weapons I always talk about the 2,300   Humvees armor-plated if our young people   would have had those Humvees they   wouldn't be walking around without legs   and arms right now believe me Coligny   but they take them they just take them   so and he said it's so discouraging for   our soldiers when they look and they see   the quality of equipment that the other   side has Isis but the other side has and   they see it's better than what we have   and it's our equipment that they've   taken it's a very very sad thing and   those kids they're incredible people but   they really lose their spirit when they   see this kind of thing believe me so   what I want to do is I'm going to jump   to the other side of the world now and   talk a little bit about North Korea   because North Korea is probably one of   the most belligerent countries on the   planet with Kim Jong and so North Korea   they have they have grown increasingly   belligerent under the Obama Clinton   administration and against them and they   have done just some unbelievable things   over there with testing of some of what   we believe is their nuclear capability   what what do you see just overall is   your strategy for North Korea well it's   not that they've done some unbelievable   things but they're in the process of   doing some unbelievable things believe   me I mean they're very belligerent they   have no respect for our country none   whatsoever and we have a situation   that's a potential catastrophe we have   somebody that truly does have nuclear   and nuclear capability   the the carrier maybe is not there yet   but it soon will be we have we have a   man who is I mean he took over 25 years   old I guess or around that and now it   looks like he's getting more and more   hostile and what I would do very simply   is say China this is your baby this is   your problem you solve the problem as   China can solve that problem and   remember this that's a big problem   [Applause]   China has virtually total control over   North Korea but they say they don't   because they want to tweek us look at   our president they wouldn't even give   him stares to come out of Air Force One   okay all right and they probably say we   couldn't get him there you know when I   saw that yesterday did everybody see   that well he couldn't get off the plane   so he had to get off on the kind that   dropped down but that's really meant for   the crew that's so that when they fixed   the plane they go up when those stairs   the whole thing is just it's insane you   know it's interesting with the president   cuz I saw that yesterday with the stairs   he went to Saudi Arabia and the top   people didn't greet him right   he went to Cuba and Castro the brother   was not there to greet him and I said to   myself you know if that happened I'd   land out here he's not there to pay   respect to the country not to him to pay   respect to our country I would say thank   you very much rose that's okay close it   up bump let's go back to Washington   let's go back to Washington   and and the scene on the airport tarmac   yesterday where this young woman is   fighting with these Chinese people in   there saying this is our country this is   in your country Wow Wow   and just so you understand we are very   good to China and I have great respect   for China and make a lot of money with   China China is great I don't hold it   against them I hold it against our   leaders for allowing this to happen with   the trade and the trade deficits the   trade deficits are massive 500 billion   dollar trade deficits now I hold it   against our leaders I respect China I   mean our people should be doing that to   them but it doesn't work out that way so   you know nothing against China I have   the largest bank in the world as a   tenant of mine I sell condos to people   in China so to everybody but but that we   allow this to happen and then we land on   Air Force One and I was saying in the   history of Air Force one which is long   and distinguished these are the only   three times where incidents like this   have taken place think of it lands in   Cuba doesn't have high officials to   greet him lands in Saudi Arabia which we   protect if we didn't protect Saudi   Arabia they would be gone okay they   would be gone but lands and Saudi Arabia   and they don't have the high officials   to grant them their highest officials   and I said to myself this probably the   only time in the history of Air Force   one word goes into a country lands and   you don't have the appropriate officials   to greet right I really believe that and   then you're talking about a long history   but then yesterday they won't give him   stairs to get off the plane   to make yeah yeah okay so one more here   I want to talk a little bit about in   this case in this case it is hard to   believe you have to it is it's   unbelievable it's unbelievable   so I want to talk a little bit about   Hillary Clinton and the FBI last week   the FBI on Friday before the three-day   weekend they released notes from Hillary   Clinton's email investigation what do   you think that these new revelations say   about her qualifications to be   commander-in-chief it's such a long   answer to that question it could go on   for days thirteen phones iPhones   whatever they were and just banging that   heck out of them   how about the acid-wash of the emails   that didn't mean anything how about the   33,000 missing emails that were   acid-washed okay acid-washed and Rudy   was telling me nobody does it because   it's such an expensive process   okay 33,000 now these emails had to do   with the wedding   I give that five the wedding and the   other thing of course was the yoga   classes right look look folks   this is this is a very sad time I'm   telling you for justice in this country   is a very sad time I've never seen   anything like it   Never Say Never   I mean go a step farther how about I   guess it was July 4th weekend the   interview takes place on July 4th   weekend with no taping no tape recorder   no nothing and right on the weekend when   everyone's like away or not watching and   then the information that they wanted   was released on Friday before Labor Day   weekend Friday afternoon everyone's away   no no this is a very very sad situation   that's going on here this is a very sad   situation I've never seen it like this   we're like a third-world country we're   like a third-world country never seen   anything like it but on November 8th we   will cure this problem   okay and finally one I want what I want   to do is I want to finish on a bit of a   high note for this great audience here   from Virginia Virginia Beach military   veterans spouses citizens here at this   local area it's great great group of   people talk talked a little bit about   building our military what would you do   to rebuild art the strength of our   military okay first of all it's not like   we have a choice okay you know somebody   said oh well we don't have to spend we   don't we're not gonna have a country if   we don't have this is one of the most   dangerous times that we've ever had some   countries are going are you you look at   what's going on with the weaponry being   produced or bought by some countries and   it's unbelievable and we're not keeping   up so this isn't like oh gee well let's   invest it someplace else or let's do   this or that when we build weapons we're   also employing people remember that so   this isn't just a one-way street we're   employing a lot of people and when we   have fighter jets I don't know if you   saw the documentaries about a month ago   there was a documentary and the fighter   jets they're so old that we can't get   parts for them anymore so they go to the   plane graveyards and the museum's where   they have the planes in these museums   and they take parts off the planes and   the museums and then we have our young   men and women flying these planes and   they were complaining they said you know   when I came in our planes were new and   great and now they're retiring they're   getting ready to leave and some of them   would like to stay but they're getting   too ready to leave and they look at you   know using old parts literally from   plane graveyards and museums is where   they get the parts this is not the   United States that we know folks this is   not the United States that we want this   is not the United SEC so so we're gonna   rebuild our military we're gonna rebuild   it with with the finest technology in   the world because we have the finest   technology we have the finest technology   but we're not paying for it anymore and   frankly we're paying for too much and   sometimes we're going to companies that   are political and we're getting things   that aren't as good you know this for   years things that aren't as good as   similar equipment that's better for less   money because they're politically   connected   the companies so you know i'm i've spent   a tremendous amount of money we're going   to announce very soon how much we've   raised we raise a lot but I've spent a   lot I've put more than sixty million   dollars into the campaign and and and   I'm gonna be spending a lot more over   the next two months better think of it   we're down to 63 days   hard to believe who would have thought   this this started on June this started   on June 16th last year and now we're   down to 63 days and I must say with your   help and with everybody's help we're   gonna we're gonna do something we're   gonna make America great again you know   it's about to make America great again   so I just want to thank everybody really   amazing people and Rudy I want to thank   you very much and Lara and Ivanka for   being here and of course a truly great   general right here Mike thank you   [Applause]   [Music]

that   challenge and from his lips to God's   ears he says we will create a whole new   system he said I understand this system   and we will create a whole new system   what has happened the whole country and   the world is in shock the first one he   started out everybody was laughing he's   a buffoon he's a reality show you know   me the self socializing promote promoter   of himself everybody was saying all   these different things when he entered   the ring to defend America the   principles of freedom justice and   equality and to be able to give the   government back to the people we the   people   [Applause]   and 14 million votes later at the begin   17 opponents we let 16 go cuz we don't   want to be braggadocious you know so he   now is the nominee now you got to   understand some the party doesn't want   him the system doesn't want him the lion   politicians doesn't warn him and you got   to understand that he's here by the will   of the people and God and bodies in all   things often   so I'm asking i love you i love you that   means so much to me for a man that is   walking in the shoes you don't mean when   they said what the guy was carrying your   God was scaring you know guy was walking   with you this year but I don't see but   one set of footprints he said because   God was carrying you you know and so you   got to understand what I'm trying to say   to you is that the white woman and I put   it in this category so you understand   what I'm saying the white woman and the   slave the people of color when the   system was created they did not give her   the first will be last and the last will   be first the white woman did not have   the rights and she still don't have the   rights and people of color don't have   their rights those are the left ops   Donald Trump says no we're going back to   inclusiveness everybody comes so that's   why when I see them try to ridiculous   him or to try to ostracize and pervert I   want you to understand every white woman   should cast a vote for Donald Trump not   but Donald Trump the man but the knock   out the system to help him to get their   rights you know if be able to deal with   it and I'm appealing to all the blacks   because they vote is giving away   cavalierly lackadaisically with no   redeeming factor in their claim to vote   by party that you've got to vote this   way you know and this is what you do but   you have nothing he is a doctor of   humaneness a doctor how do you how do   you cure disease when you are Santa's   how do you discover the science of the   fact that what you're trying to do in an   evolution of time in progress you   examine effects that climbing you try to   find out what originates what does it   come from it's just like they trying to   do now with zig and cancer you want to   find every way   can to get it then you go to the cause   we are treating the effects not the   cause he is the only man that is took on   that awesome that responsibility that   says why and when he says why he had to   be able to demonstrate to blacks and the   white woman to left house and all the   freedom-loving white men that we must   put him in the office so we can get a   chance for America to operate on what   America was founded in a new nation   conceived in Liberty and dedicated to   the proposition that all men and women   are created equal   so I am indeed very very proud I feel   other than privileged that I have this   opportunity to speak to you and I'm   telling all of my brothers I understand   they're looking for a position where   they could be close to whoever would be   the president or what they can do with   is the system is the enemy not Donald   Trump and when they come out to   castigate and you can see they vet him   like no other person in the world you   must realize his genius his genius lies   in his ability to think and to win and   to be successful alright so if he's the   biggest man you don't vet him like you   would do a politician alright but they   do they vet him 90 the politician   because he takes nothing and made   something out of it everything that they   would condemn that would be looked upon   as some type of desecration and economic   exploitation he would just flip the corn   and make it a successful occupation   that's the biggest thing we want to do   the same thing with our country hear me   we will do our same thing with our   country I'm go around the world I got   leaders around the world presidents   called me like I'm going like I'm a   leader or something because we can they   can say things to me off the cuff that   you can't say política gret he don't   care about no political correctness he   was right justified right and that's why   I will walk with him talk with him and   plead to the people to understand the   system is the problem and he's the only   gladiator that would take on the system   like a david-and-goliath to be able to   throw this system and create a new   system whereas in compasses all women   people who color blacks and all   freedom-loving people coming together to   support themselves under the leadership   of the dynamic the human man that will   fight for your right a Donald Trump this   is what we want and just what America   needs americanese Donald Trump we need   mantra especially black people   because you got to understand my black   brothers and sisters they told me you   got to try to emulate and imitate the   white man and then you can be successful   so we tried that so you said you can get   some money you can do this here I told   Michael Jackson I said if you poor you   are poor negro I will use the N word but   if you if you rich you are a rich negro   if you are intelligent intellectual your   intellectual negro if you are dancing   and sliding and gliding it I mean nig   Negro you are dancing and sliding and   gliding negro so they're not alienate   because you cannot assimilate so you   know you gonna be a Negro to your dad so   when you deal with the reality of what   life really means I learned a lesson   from that because I've been on both   sides an area where not come out the   penitentiary add a congregation waiting   for me it's similar to this with the   leaders of our community asking me to   save the hospital and it does my heart   good my heart reflecting nostalgically   is a joy to me could we save Cleveland   and being doves literally this come from   Carl Burton Stokes and all the rest and   they would come up in there the change   things in and uh I owe the great state   of Ohio to come you today to bring a man   that says we're going to change the   nation and I'm honored and privileged   dedicated to the commitment of the   principles of this great nation to   introduce to you the next president of   the United States down day tuck oh dang   hoc dau gay fuck   full of people not for him so much he's   a goober but he's the leader that were   leaders to the promised land let's get   rid of this system and he's the Manager   ah there's only one Don King only one   done I want to thank you very much and   Don that was so special I spoke to don   yesterday said how about taking a trip   to Cleveland he said I loved Lakeland   this is his place and I said I'd love to   have you introduced me and he was right   there and we left at six o'clock in the   morning he was right there and he's an   amazing guy and he's been a friend of   mine for a long time and I don't want to   say he's a good guy because I don't want   to destroy his reputation but he is a   good guy he's a phenomenal person and he   became very rich she was very smart he   took advantage of lots of situations and   I have great respect for that and had   great respect for him and I want to   thank done for being here thank you   I want to certainly thank my friend   Darrell Scott who's just an amazing guy   amazing   I met Darryl through Michael and then I   saw Darryl on television I called   Michael I said this man is fantastic   where do you find somebody like this I   have to really get to know him a little   better and I have gotten to know him   better and he is a spectacular and I   watched him on television and I feel so   sorry for the people that are on the   other side of the table because I've   only seen you about a hundred times so   far nobody else is one he knows he knows   how to win and he loves you folks I will   tell you that he loves you folks that he   loves this church so Darryl thank you   very much I appreciate it pastor spot   pastor stock and Michael thank you not   only for the introduction but also for a   beautiful speech I think Michael worked   very hard on this great chef ben Carson   has been my friend for a long time and   he was tough he was the wisdom   he was tough I'll tell you what I was   doing really well but there was one guy   in the pack every weekend look at those   poles so Ben was it I was at 28 29 Ben   was like that Ted but then the next week   he was at 12 and I had to be so nice   he's such an incredible guy and then he   was at 14 and 16 20 and he went to 21 24   I said what do we do to stop this guy he   was a force that he was so nice he did   better than anybody i will tell you he   did better than anybody it was he was   amazing I'll tell you what he was   amazing and he's got not only is he a   brilliant guy but he's got a brilliant   heart he loves people and if all of this   happens there will be a great place for   Ben I don't know if he wants that but I   know he wants to help people but there   will be a great place and general Flynn   another man who was just so info   oh boy there's a tough general I always   talk about Magatha have a big fan of   General Douglas MacArthur and in general   george patton and if they saw what was   going on today with all the butchery and   all of the problems they they're   spinning in a grave right now at the way   we fight we have to end that problem and   this is a man that knows how to end   problems and general Flynn along with   general Kellogg and some of our other   friends we have so many friends we have   over 200 generals and admirals   supporting us now can you imagine that I   didn't know they had that many I didn't   know they had that many generals but   we've had and then the other day you   probably saw that we had 17   Congressional Medal of Honor winners   endorsed me so we had the Admirals we   had the generals and we had the   Congressional Medal of Honor winners and   it's been it's been really an amazing   period of time so I just want to thank   everybody and I want to thank the   african-american community because I   don't know if you've been watching but   the poll numbers are going like a rocket   ship   I think initially where I was very low i   think additionally they didn't know what   to expect and as I spoke about the inner   cities which are in such trouble and I   spoke about instances like we're having   today with Charlotte and Tulsa and   problems and we want to see that unify   as quickly as possible those are two   problems that we have to get that   unified and taking care of it's sad to   see but as I spoke about the inner   cities and what I'll do and it's   interesting because I went down a list   of problems in the inner cities and I'd   said this three or four times before and   I go down the list and we talk about the   incredible crime incredible chicago i   think has had three thousand shootings   as an example from just the beginning of   the year 3000 thousands of people are   being killed and it's very horrible but   i talked about the crime i talked about   the lack of education the bad schools   and i talked about jobs the jobs are to   submit and i said it three four or five   times and then one day I said what do   you have to lose I mean what do you have   to lose I'm gonna fix it what do you   have to lose and somehow that resonated   some people didn't like it but I said   what difference does it make I mean it's   it's it's true what do you have to lose   and it resonated and it's been amazing   how it's resonated because it's true the   Democrats have run the inner cities for   in some cases up to a hundred years   unbroken unbroken and we're very   different I'm different and I'm   different from a lot of Republicans   friendly and that's why we're winning   states that aren't even in play for   other Republicans where   I mean as an example somebody said we're   up in Maine means not a state where   Republicans are exactly you know   flocking to but we're up in Maine it's   an amazing amazing thing we're doing   great in Connecticut we're doing great   all over actually so we're winning   Florida we're winning Ohio I see we're   winning North Carolina we're winning   we're winning it's just an amazing thing   we're winning Colorado we're up four   points and we're up in other places that   are just amazing places and great and   we're thrilled we just had a very good   poll from New Mexico New Mexico so we're   winning areas that are not usually areas   that people consider but that's why   you're seeing the boards you remember   the boards three four weeks ago the   whole electoral map well Trump has a   very now all of a sudden all these   states are opening up to segue to what's   going on here then they're writing about   it and we are working very very hard and   hopefully at the end and i want to also   i have to thank mike pence what an   unbelievable precipice and you know the   first time I met Mike I liked him a lot   and he was very much considered that   this was going to be his position a lot   of people wanted him to run he's done   too right he's run incredibly in Indiana   very very popular has one of the most   successful states have a triple a bond   rating their taxes have gone down their   employment has been incredible and they   brought companies in one of the few   places that has actually brought   companies it's been a great story and at   the story he's done is incredible but   the first time I met him we had a   wonderful meeting lasted 20 minutes and   I actually asked him for his endorsement   because I was running in Indiana which   we wanted a landslide which was fair and   he couldn't do that because of the fact   that he had   other commitments any endorse Ted Cruz   but the next day when he made the   endorsement I thought it was more of an   endorsement for me because he started   talking about how great Donald Trump is   then he said I'm voting for Ted Cruz and   let's get back to Donald Trump the guy's   unbelievable faq Ted Cruz didn't know   whether or not he was endorsed most   people thought he'd go see I thought it   was one of the good but I liked him I   liked him regardless I liked him well   said something after that first 15 or 20   minute left and he said Donald may we   pray now that doesn't happen too often   coming from New York when I leave an   office it's usually like they have bad   thoughts believe me bad bad thoughts but   he said did you know that fast he said   may we pray now Darrell's really   inspired by Mike but Mike is great and   we did pray and mike is great and his   family Karen and the family are   incredible so that was a really good   choice I wrote some things out that I   think so much about thank you thank you   stand up my Terran yeah   amazing   [Applause]   it's been an amazing partner and he's   all over the place yesterday he was in   Virginia and it was a downpour they had   a great group of people and it was I   never wanted to get the kind of crowds I   get because I'll probably then get angry   at him and jealous but he'll teach me   not to be jealous something Darrell's   was going to work him but but he had a   great crowd yesterday in Virginia and   there was this massive downpour like   record type setting and the role outside   I guess on a long and they were drenched   and he said call me up he said nobody   left and the press actually covered it   they said nobody left they'd never seen   anything like it and that's a good sign   because I think we're going to do really   well in Virginia too so that's a good   sign so Michael thank you and ver   special very special guy and Omarosa   don't leave amuro says he's a wonderful   woman don't leave she's a wonderful   woman she has done so much for me with   the african-american community with   communities generally and she's another   one she is such a fine person and nobody   knows it and I just blew her income for   the next 20 years you are amazing okay   and I just want to thank you very much   for everything you've done she worked so   hard she feels so strongly thank you I'm   barossa I mean I did help make her a   star in all fairness I don't feel I   don't feel so guilty so thank you i   wrote some things out having to do   largely with the inner cities and the   inner city right here and i'll read it   out for you but i feel very strongly   about it so much can be done so much can   be done it it's not being done they come   and they take your vote and then they   say we'll see you in four years thanks a   lot and we'll see you in four years and   we're going to do it a lot differently   for centuries the african-american   church has been the conscience of our   country it's from the pews pulpits and   Christian teachings of black churches   all across the land that the civil   rights movement lifted up   the soul of our nation it's from these   views that our nation has been inspired   toward a better moral character a deeper   concern for mankind and a spirit of   charity and unity that binds us all   together the african-american faith   community has been one of God's greatest   gifts to America and to the American   people there is perhaps no action our   leaders can take that would do more to   heal and I mean he'll our country and   support our people than to provide a   greater platform stronger greater to the   black churches and church goers I was in   Detroit recently with Bishop Jackson who   was an incredible guy also and it was   incredible what I saw the love in that   room and I'm not saying the love for me   I'm just saying the love in that room   for everybody and the spirit even the   song his wife is a beautiful singer with   a magnificent the play it was just   amazing I didn't want to leave so it's   great you do write every day by your   community and your family you raise   children and the light of God I will   always support your church and defend   your right to worship always I will   always be there   I am here today to listen to your   message and I hope my presence here will   help and very much help your voice to   reach new audiences it's going to happen   in our country and these are people   believe me many people out there that   desperately need it Christian faith is   not the past but the present and the   future it is the foundation of progress   and I pledge to you that if I win some   people say if and when let's say if   because we have to be realistic close   race but if you all go out and vote   we're going to win but I pledge to you   that we're going to end the Johnson   amendment which takes away the voice of   your pastors your ministry your great   leaders takes away their voice we're   going to end quickly quickly the Johnson   it's so important thank you it's taken   away your voice passed in nineteen   fifty-four by a very powerful man Lyndon   Johnson because he didn't get along with   a certain church they say in Houston   because the pastor was maybe against him   maybe not with him maybe something was   going on shows you the power of Lyndon   Johnson go respect you have to have   respect it but he had this past that   takes away your leaders and your your   people that you most respect people like   pastor darrell scott he's not allowed to   talk politics if he does they take away   his tax exception so what they're doing   is they're silencing your leaders their   silencing the people that you want to   hear it's not fair because they're the   people I want to hear also so we're   going to get rid of the Johnson and then   as I campaign all across this nation and   in every community I will have an   opportunity to lay out my plans for   economic change I will have a chance to   discuss school choice which is so   important and how to put every American   on the ladder to success meaning a great   education and a great job   but today I just want to let you know   that I am here to listen to you I'm   going to listen and I'm always going to   listen to promise that I make I'm   running to be president for all   Americans every single one our nation is   to divide it we talk past each other   constantly not to each other and to   those who seek office we do not do   enough to step in to the community and   learn what is happening and what is   going on they don't do it again they   want your vote and they're gone i'm here   today to learn so that we can together   remedy injustice in all of its many very   unattractive forms our political system   has failed the people and works only to   enrich itself i want to reform that   system so that it works for you all of   you I believe true reform can only come   from outside the system from outside the   establishment becoming the nominee of   the party of Abraham Lincoln has been   the greatest honor of my life it's on   his legacy that I hope to build the   future of our party I believe we need a   civil rights agenda for our time one   that ensures the right to a good   education and the right to live in   safety and then peace it also means the   right so true so so unsafe when you see   people being shot in the streets walk   into a store with their child oftentimes   their child being shot for no reason   whatsoever so sad it also means the   right to have a government that protects   our workers and fights for our jobs I   want to rebuild our country and I want   to rebuild our   inner cities it's time it's time it   breaks my heart to see any American left   behind or to see a city like Cleveland   that has had so many struggles nothing   is more sad than when we sideline young   Americans with unfulfilled potential you   look at somebody like Don King where   he's become so successful he just broke   that system he wouldn't take no I mean   he's an amazing inspiration to so many   people including me our whole country   loses ever we're one nation and when   anyone hurts we all hurt together that's   the way it is so where it should be too   we are all brothers and sisters and   we're all created Oh everyone created by   the same God we must love each other and   support each other and we're all in this   together   [Applause]   I fully understand that the   african-american community has suffered   from discrimination and that there are   many wrongs that must still be made   right I want to make America prosperous   for everyone I want to make this city   the economic envy of the world here and   Detroit and Baltimore and there's so   many places we have so much work to do   factories everywhere new roads new   bridges new schools new hope I'm going   to bring our jobs back our jobs have   been taken away by inept politicians   that don't know what they're doing our   companies have left and gone to Mexico   and other places we're going to bring   our jobs back believe me and it's not   even going to be hard I have been so   greatly blessed and in so many ways with   no greater blessing than my family has a   wonderful family nothing would make me   happier and more fulfilled than to use   what I have learned in business and in   traveling the world I have been all over   to bring wealth and prosperity and   opportunity to those who have not had   these opportunities before when I see   wages falling and falling big-league   people were making more money 18 years   ago in many cases than they're making   today and today they're working harder   they have two jobs it's not supposed to   be that way I know the hardships this   inflicts and I am determined to do   something about it please know this for   any who are hurting things are going to   turn and turn for the better   we are going to win again as a country   and we are going to win again for all of   our people not just certain segments of   our people for all of our people I want   to work with you to renew the bonds of   trust between citizens and the bonds our   faith that make our nation strong   America has been lifted out of many of   its most difficult hours through the   miracle of faith and you people   understand that very well everybody in   this room understands which is one of   the reasons you're here now in these   hard times for our country let us turn   again to our Christian heritage to lift   up the soul of our nation I am so deeply   grateful to be here today and it's my   prayer that America and the America of   tomorrow will be one of unity   togetherness peace and love we can do   that I'd like to conclude with a passage   from first John chapter 4 no one has   ever seen God but if we love one another   God lives in US and his love is made   complete in us so true so pastor I want   to thank you I want to thank the   congregation this has been a really   great honor for me and we have some   interesting days ahead we have a little   debate on monday night a couple of you   might be watching anybody going to watch   something and   and we have a very big election coming   up on november eight so hopefully get   out and vote but again to the   african-american community to the   hispanic community to all communities I   want to just say we're going to make it   right we're going to make it great thank   you thank you all thank you all mr.   Trump we have a few questions that come   on give that   we have some questions that we solicited   from the pastor's we have pastors here   from all over the great state of Ohio   some drove along distance we ask them   some questions that we would like for   you to answer question number one our   failing public school systems are   holding our children bay what is your   plan to help our children get access to   the best possible education and what is   your view on school choice we have to   have choice choices and must and we have   to end common core and bring education   local common core is it reserves for and   we're gonna have great education in our   country we don't have it now but choice   very important it's very very important   and Common Core has to be ended we're   bringing education local meaning our   loving parents and all of the   professionals we're going to do it on a   local basis not with the bureaucrats   okay mr. Trump our second question says   inner cities have been ravaged by   violence and addiction it has been   spawned with tensions between law   enforcement and our neighborhoods how   would you encourage peace and build   safer communities well one of the ways   is places just like this you see what's   going on in this room and you have   everybody in this room you have Asian   you have white you have black Europe   everybody right here and you see what's   happening something that the churches   are so important in all of our religious   institutions and the other thing we have   to stop the drugs from pouring in from   across the border we have a tremendous   drug problem in Cleveland   in Ohio and in North Carolina and South   Carolina and and in New Hampshire it's a   tremendous problem heroin in particular   in New Hampshire but we are our country   is being poisoned and it's pouring   across the southern border and we are   going to stop at milady you know the the   Border Patrol agents are great 16,500   they endorse us recently and they   endorsed from first time they've ever   endorsed a presidential candidate we are   going to stop the drugs from poisoning   our youth from pouring into our country   just poisoning are you the   african-american community has   traditionally voted Democrat I mean II   be honest we got strong opposition from   the Democratic Party through the black   Museum for this meeting but then stop at   nothing here you're making a strong case   for the Republican vote this year how   can the conservative agenda help all of   our communities well you know it's not   even about a conservative agenda you've   been trying and working in the inner   cities with the Democrats for so many   years sometimes over a hundred years   there are excellent communities so and   they're a disaster the school's the   safety the jobs it's all horrible I mean   in some cases there are less safe than   places like Afghanistan you know we hear   about Afghanistan some of the inner   cities are less safe so I just tell you   this we are going to make such headway   such a change and you know they're not   going to do it Chris Darryl they've been   doing it for 50 60 some were I mean   minimum is like 32 I think there's one   said 32 unbroken unbroken and I say that   and some people I told you before some   people love it and some people don't   like it that much what do you have to   lose can't get any worse it really can't   the inner cities cannot get much worse   perhaps they can but   much and I will fix it what do you have   to lose I will fix it so we're going to   change it just just a couple more the   number one issue plaguing so many   families is the lack of jobs our   families are struggling to find work how   do you pledge to grow the economy and   create jobs for America well we have   NAFTA and these agreements these trade   deals are the worst deals anybody ever   negotiated NAFTA is destroyed our   country is destroyed our manufacturing   our manufacturing has gone to Mexico in   all these other countries and we're   going to renegotiate those deals and   we're going to make them either very   good and very fair or we're going to   terminate them will start all over again   believe me we're going to bring our jobs   back we're going to bring our companies   back that have left us fired all their   employees we're going to bring them back   so that will be the thing maybe I   originally started on that and illegal   immigration and we have to stop illegal   immigration by the way we have to stop   the legal immigration and Hillary   Clinton is not in any way shape before   I'm capable of doing then two more this   is a question that I believe each and   every pastor in this room is concerned   once this election is over in what ways   will you continue to engage the faith   community when we're not simply for volt   or whatever but where we have a   continued access to the White House to   speak what we perceive to be the voice   of God to you well I can tell you a   number of the ways are by getting you   folks Darrell all of you and Ben Carson   and everybody totally involved with the   communities because right now you don't   have any involvement with Washington   very little and the involvement that you   have which is a common core involvement   the involvement that you have is not a   good environment we're going to be very   much involved with the inner cities and   we're going to create incentives for the   inner city so that the inner cities can   grow and produce jobs and we're going to   bring our jobs back from all these   countries that have stolen them like   we're a bunch of babies it's like candy   being taken away from a baby that's the   way they took it and we're not going to   let that happen anymore many of you   folks have had great jobs and you don't   have it anywhere your company is gone   and you've never been able to replace   that great job you had when you were   younger and that we are going to bring   our companies back and we're going to   bring our jobs back believe me it is to   a large extent about jobs mr. Trump this   is for most of the pastors and leaders   here this is a very big question much   hinges on this the question says the   next Supreme Court justice will make   decisions will that will touch the   rights of every American that may come   to define the nature of our government   and our society for many years will you   stand strong on your suggested   appointments and stay committed to   naming only true constitutionalists to   the bench yes the answer is yes you know   as a hundred-percent hundred-percent Wow   good   well   you know that question and that response   is amazing because I get it so many   places and you'll hear about these never   Trumper's who are dying professor right   now there are respiratory k because the   unity is becoming incredible yesterday   in the Wall Street Journal they have an   amazing story about amazing Wall Street   Journal story today about all of the   support that we're getting from lots of   rich people even they're coming in you   know these would never Trump never Trump   never Trump and now they're believing   they see not lower taxes they see   cutting the regulations they see job   creation which is so important and it's   really been amazing and one of the   things that they see and that you people   say is that and so important to judges   so I picked 11 judges very very much   into the world of the Constitution   because we have we have people that in   some cases not adding in all cases will   have absolutely no the Constitution will   have no bearing on their decisions okay   if somebody else gets it and we picked   11 and we're adding 9 more we're going   to have a total of twenty people and i   will pick from that group of 20 people   these are 20 outstanding people the rest   of them already 11 have been named we're   adding 9 more who are terrific very much   federalist society choices heritage and   Federalists and they're really really   amazing judges and I will pick from that   group and these judges you know we lost   judge Scalia and these judges are very   much the mold of judge Scalia so I think   it's a very important so on   so important this election so those   people and those Republicans that aren't   helping that they should be ashamed of   themselves this abuse and over the final   question I know that's right this is the   final question I just added it it's a   question that involves all Americans not   just black Americans but Sir question   this one everyone's mine and I feel   honored to be able to ask you this   question if you answered for the first   time two adjustable the first time   because I know the media is here how   y'all doing and your response is going   to be verbal rate around this planet so   you can take your time and think it   through what do you have to say about   the recent shootings of unarmed black   men by the police up to and including   the shooting in North Carolina one   yesterday and the shooting in Tulsa the   day before well as you know I'm a   tremendous believer in the police and   law enforcement because we need that for   ourselves we do and I've really gotten   the endorsement from so many different   groups and they're great people they're   great people now great people you always   have problems you have somebody in there   that either makes a mistake that's bad   or the chokes I must tell you I watched   the shooting in particular in tulsa and   that man was hands up that man went to   the car hands up put his hand on the car   I mean to me it looked like he did   everything you're supposed to do and he   looked like a really good man   and maybe I'm a little clouded because I   saw his family talking about him after   the fact so you get a little bit you   know different image maybe but to me   look like a you know somebody that was   doing what they were asking him to do   and this young officer I don't know what   she was thinking I don't know what she   was thinking but I'm very very troubled   by that I'm very very troubled by there   and we have to be very go to be very   careful so I mean these things are   terrible that was in my opinion that was   a terrible terrible situation and we see   others we've seen others and the police   are aware of that too by the way the   police are troubled by it they look at   it now did she get scared it was she   joking what happened but maybe people   like that people that choke people that   do that maybe they can't be doing what   they do okay I can't be doing what okay   so   [Applause]   so we all respect our police greatly and   they will just have to get better and   better and better thank you let's put   our hands together for mr. Donnell Jim   truck listen bitch here's what I want   you to do I'm going to ask my wife the   one who does all the work in this church   and I get all the credit for but she's   going to come I want you to stretch your   hands for towards Donald Trump I want   miss dr. ben Carson to come his lovely   wife to come and once a min of God here   passed a crank of media dock JC church   lay hands on him and she's been a friend   I want you to stretch forth your hands   and I really want you to intercede on   his behalf years ago years ago when we   first met him he was considering running   for president there was a great preacher   that I don't want to say his name but he   is nationally known and he said   something new I don't know if you   remember he said I want you to   understand mr. Trump that if you choose   to run for president there's going to be   a concentrated satanic attack against   you he said this over over five years   ago he said they said there's going to   be a demon principalities and powers are   going to war against you on a level that   you've never seen before and i'm   watching this every day so we're going   to pray for him I want to first take   this opportunity to thank Cleveland Ohio   I want to thank all of the media that   came out I want to thank all of you men   and women of God that came out I want to   thank all the leaders   came out I want to thank all of you that   took time out of your day I remember   when we won the championship of a   Cleveland Cavaliers won and they kept   saying there's going to be mess going on   there's going to be stuff going on   Cleveland is just a different place we   know how to conduct ourselves in   Cleveland and we represent very well   this is a monumental day I have the   pleasure of I'm different from my   husband in so many ways more than just   gender you know the soul was different   I'm very sensitive about who I need and   who I get to know I'm just that kind of   a person not because I'm funny but   because I'm just I'm a sensitive and and   when I first met mr. Trump he walked   through the doors of Trump Towers and I   thought oh my that's that's very tall   making and and I said as he walked in he   immediately bowed his head and I I my   husband will tell you and anyone all our   leadership Thank You ministers of new   spirit revival center I you guys know   that I pay attention to the details I   can't help it I just walk into the room   vintage indeed he immediately dropped   his head and he recognized that he was   in the room with clergy mr. Trump has a   reverence from for clergy that I've   never seen before in my 58   50 baby 59 years of my life I know it's   hard for you all to believe that the man   that has shown in the media is different   I'm here to tell you this is a different   man this is a unique man this is a   leader this is a person that will be   great for our nation this is a person   that I'd be black good for black   Americans this is a person that will be   good for black women all right this was   a person that will be good for our   nation and most of all my concern   whether you know me or not this is a   person that will be good for our   military this is a person that's going   to make our nation save our country safe   we don't want a nation that we walk down   the street and bombings will be   happening every time we don't want to be   shot at for no reason we want to visit   our mouths go to our synagogues go to   our churches I feel like reaching this   morning I want to be free in our nation   and I believe that mr. Donald J Trump   will honor that freedom and if y'all   here note that the Spirit of the Lord is   real let's just let out of place not for   the man before the God that we serve   come on y'all can do so much better than   that we are American so we just serve to   be free we can buy   we wanna buy do what we want to do be   great if we want to be great and I think   mr. Donald J Trump will do that and no i   didn't write this down cuz i can't   follow those times like they do but i'm   telling you excuse me sweetie i know i   went there but I you shouldn't gave me   the mic I appreciate this man i really   appreciate michael cohen i appreciate   him I didn't think God could create   anybody like Daryl Scott but I promise   you michael cohen and mr.

  we'll call this the midnight special   speech   and you have all of the dishonest   reporters I have to give him credit they   followed me around all over the place   they're exhausted look at that see the   cameras they're sagging Cabras a second   and they just said could you delay it a   little while because they got you know a   little delayed because they're playing   isn't quite as fast so I said let's   let's start without a now they're also   Ferris a november eighth we are going to   win the great state of virginia and we   are going to win back the White House   and we are going to do this election   will decide whether we're ruled by a   corrupt political class or whether we   are ruled by yourselves the people gonna   be the people I'm not a politician my   only special interest is you you know I   used to be on the other side folks in   case you hadn't heard I think I know   more about the other side than almost   anybody but I love the country I just   loved this country and our country was   going bad our country was going bad you   look at the Iran deal you look at our   borders you look at the fact that we're   not funding our military properly we   have depleted military the greatest   people on earth but it's depleted so   many different things and I said you   know what we're going to do this and on   june sixteenth of last year we did it   and now look we're just about right up   to the finish line i say i really call   it i really call it you know because   that's the finish but the work begins   right the work begins and we will make   America great again Bolivia   real change begins with immediately   immediately repealing and replacing   Obamacare   [Applause]   and speaking of great care Jerry Falwell   Jr has been unbelievable unbelievable   what an unbelievable family Becky the   children what an unbelievable guy   Liberty University what an unbelievable   group of people so I want to thank you I   want to thank Laura where's Laura Laura   Laura Ingraham credible talented   unbelievable person and general where's   our general good general Kellogg this is   not a general that will say when they go   in famoso we will be going into Mosul in   four months we will get ready everybody   we're going to cover in about four   months then three months in two months   you heard about that Laura Wright never   ends never ends by the time they go in   everyone's gone except for the ones that   fight and they fighting hard they've   been given a lot of notice you would do   it my way general right you agree with   me right like you know the element of   surprise you like that right when we're   fighting we go the element of surprise   it's just been announced that the   residents of Virginia are going to   experience a massive double-digit   premium hike on Obama to big number   folks I'm not going to tell you what the   number is because I want you to leave   happy but it's a big number but it's not   gonna matter because we're gonna repeal   it and replace it much less expensive   and much better   in the great state of Arizona premiums   are going up more than one hundred and   sixteen percent I just left there they   are not happy about Obamacare fact my   poll numbers are going through the roof   I think it might be Obama care to be   honest with you over half of the   counties in Virginia losing Obamacare   insurers next year premiums are surging   companies are leaving insurers are   fleeing doctors acquitting and   deductibles are going through the roof   speaking about going through the roof we   got about 8,000 people outside I hope   [Applause]   it's unbelievable the response is just   you know it's almost like a response to   common sense it's much more complicated   than that but it's sort of like a   response to common sense right yet   Hillary Clinton wants to double down on   Obamacare making it even more expensive   than it is right now which is hard to   believe I'm asking for your vote so we   can together repeal and replace   Obamacare and save health care for every   family in virginia and the united states   we're going to save real change also   means restoring honesty to our   government Hillary Clinton is the most   corrupt person ever to seek the office   of the presidency of the United States   she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails   after receiving a congressional subpoena   and you heard about today he heard about   today but right now she's being   protected by a totally rigged system   I've been talking about the Rick sister   fuck I understand the Rick system I   understand this is a rigged system this   is a rigged system Hillary Clinton is   guilty she knows that the FBI knows it   the people the FBI they know it's I   think it's very embarrassing to them and   now it's up to the American people to   deliver the justice   well we have a very obnoxious young lady   here   [Applause]   that's all right   you even find them at 12 o'clock in the   evening some believable   it's up to the American people to   deliver justice at the ballot box and on   november eighth but you have to get out   and you have to vote your governor has   illegally given voting rights to 60,000   felons he's letting criminals cancel out   the votes of law-abiding citizens   you have to get everyone you know to the   polls we are going to

well and these   people back there now they're a little   dreary because we've been doing this all   day long but these people back there   they don't know what the hell is going   on this is not supposed to be happy my   contract with the American voter begins   I don't mind you doing among the most   dishonest people on earth believed it my   contract with the American voter begins   with a plan to end government corruption   and take our country back from the   special interests I want the entire   corrupt Washington establishment to hear   the words we're all about to say all of   us together you know that phrase that I   thought was very hokey guess what now we   like it it's going on when we win on   november eighth we are going to drain   the swamp   [Applause]   at the corner of my contract is my plan   to bring back our jobs Virginia which is   hard to believe I have a lot of property   in Virginia great property you know the   property Potomac Falls and Loudoun   County and Trump vineyards from fingers   great places Virginia has lost almost   forty percent of its manufacturing jobs   since NAFTA a deal signed by Bill   Clinton and supported by his wife   crooked hell away   America has lost seventy thousand   factories since China entered the word   the World Trade Organization you know   that another bill and hillary back   disaster we aren't living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world a trump administration will   stop the jobs from leaving America and   we will stop the jobs from leaving   Virginia that I can tell you we will   renegotiate NAFTA stand up too far and   cheating and fight for every last   American job as part of our plan to   bring back jobs we are going to lower   taxes on American business from   thirty-five percent to fifteen percent   and we will massively cut taxes for the   middle class the middle class has not   been treated well and Hillary Clinton by   the way is going to be raising taxes big   league big league you know that you've   seen it with the highest tax nation in   the world she wants to raise your taxes   we will unleash the power of American   energy including shale oil natural gas   and clean coal and we will put our   miners back to work we will put our   steel workers back to work we will   cancel billions of dollars in global   warming payments to the United Nations   we don't even know what they do with it   and use that money to invest in our own   country and by the way when it comes to   that we want crystal clear and clean   water we want beautifully clean air and   we want safety the rest of it will put   back into rebuilding the environmental   infrastructure of our country right   we're sending all of these billions and   billions and billions of dollars away   you can imagine what's happening to that   money nobody has any idea we will also   rebuild our inner cities our inner   cities are so said african-american   community Hispanic community not fair   the inner cities you can't walk to the   store for a loaf of bread you get shot   you get shot worse in many cases then   war zones you look at some of these war   zones that we see every night on   television no education no jobs we are   going to fix the inner cities we are   going to fix the inner circle we're   going to help   [Applause]   we're gonna help but you know the   expression i've been using what the hell   do you have to lose because the   Democrats have run them into the ground   they've run the inner cities into the   ground they come around every four years   give me a vote they get the vote and   then they say see you in another four   years we're going to do a great job   we're going to fix it we're going to fix   the inner cities and you watch we're   gonna put jobs we're going to have good   education we're going to have safety and   I think it's going to be something very   special we will become a rich nation   again but to be a rich nation we must   also be a safe nation Hillary Clinton   wants a fit think about this one she   wants a five hundred and fifty percent   increase and this is over the tremendous   number of people coming in now of the   Syrian refugees pouring into our country   and virtually unlimited immigration from   the most egregious and dangerous regions   of the oh don't worry about we're going   to build the wall Fox the world don't   worry about it   well we're gonna build a wall it may be   almost one o'clock in the morning but I   guarantee we're gonna build that wall   [Applause]   Oh   [Applause]   only in Virginia only in Virginia could   this we have only in Virginia so I can   say that because I live here a lot and I   stay there and I love it I have the   greatest employees to the greatest   people and they like me they like me I   like them oh there's some of you so   she's going to allow a tremendous inflow   of Syrians coming pouring into the   country and we can't do that her plan   will import generations of terrorism   extremism and radicalism into your   schools and all throughout your   communities when I'm elected president   we will suspend the Syrian refugee   program and we will keep radical Islamic   terrorists the hell out of our country   to keep them out   we'll help them with safe havens and   we'll get the Gulf states to pay but   we're keeping them out you look at   what's happening with Germany you look   at what's happening with France you look   at what's happening it's a mess we have   enough problems in our country right now   folks the Trump administration will also   secure and defend the borders of the   United States and as for this young man   again we will build a great wall and   Mexico will pay for the war we've got to   stop the drugs from pouring into this   country and poisoning our youth and   plenty of others and it's a tremendous   epidemic like we've never had before you   see what's happening so we're going to   build a wall we're going to stop the   drugs we're going to have people come   into our country but they're going to   come in Legally through a very good and   modern process I'm going to come in a   little and we're going to be happy to   have them and they're going to be happy   to be here and they're going to love our   country and our values and our people   Hillary supports totally open borders   there goes your country and strongly   support sanctuary cities like San   Francisco where Kate Steinle was   murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported at least five times thousands   of Americans would be alive today if not   for the open border policies of Barack   Obama and Hillary Clinton violent   criminal cartels are spreading into all   50 of our state's and spreading all   across Virginia you know about him more   than ninety percent of those arrested   are here illegally in manassas an   illegal immigrant recently killed three   and wounded three in a shooting spree   the illegal immigrant first shot and   killed Brenda ashcraft who rented a room   to him and then shot and killed her son   William after shooting two other   residents of the house he ran to a   nearby house   shot and killed his friend and slashed   violently a 77-year old landlady with a   knife the illegal immigrant killer had   been ordered to port at five years   earlier and everybody that knew him said   he was violent please please get him out   of the country or put him in prison   incarcerate him but the Obama   administration didn't want to act last   year nearby sterling seventeen-year-old   Dani Santino Miranda was walking his   school bus to the bus when he was shot   twice in the back by an illegal   immigrant the murderer entered the   United States illegally in 2013 was   released by the Obama administration and   then murdered Danny everybody that knew   this person this murderer said please   incarcerate him he's very dangerous and   very violent a trump administration will   end this nightmare of violence   immediately   [Applause]   we will cancel all federal funding of   sanctuary cities we will stop illegal   immigration deport all criminal aliens   and dismantle every last criminal gang   in cartel threatening our citizens   they're all over it's getting worse and   worse and worse weakness you notice call   called weakness we will also repeal   that's true a lot of political acts I   have to say you're right about that we   will also repeal the obama-clinton   defense II question and we will rebuild   our badly depleted military we have no   choice we have to we will build new   ships and submarines at Norfolk Naval   Shipyard a new modern aircraft will fly   from places like Langley Air Force Base   you know our fighter jets in 19 and 20   years old some are so old you can't even   get parts from this is what our great   pilots are flying right now you can't   even get parts they take them from the   plane graveyards and museums can't get   parts it's not gonna happen anymore   folks believe me a new foreign policy is   going to put America first America fight   to all Americans I say it is time for   change and it is time for new leadership   it's time it's time just think about   what we can accomplish in the first 100   days of a trump administration we're   going to have the biggest tax cut since   Ronald Reagan   and Hilary wants to raise your taxes as   I said we're going to eliminate every   unnecessary job-killing regulation we   will cancel every illegal Obama   executive order we will protect   religious liberty did you hear that   Jerry Falwell wherever you are Jerry for   protect religious liberty so important   rebuild our military and take care of   our great veterans who have not been   taken care of the Veterans   Administration is a disaster to take   care of our veterans folks it's time   we're going to provide school choice and   put an end to common core we're bringing   our education local   [Applause]   and we will support the great men and   women of law enforcement   we will save our Second Amendment you   know the NRA gave me their earliest   endorsement these are great people Wayne   and Kris and all of these are people   that love our country believe me but   they endorsed me very early early as   they've ever given and we are going to   save our Second Amendment and appoint   justices to the Supreme Court of the   United States who will uphold and defend   the Constitution of the United States it   is time to cut our ties with the failed   to politicians of the past Hillary   Clinton is the candidate of yesterday   you know she's been doing this for 30   years in failing all over the place   folks look at what she's done everything   she touches turns bad we are the   movement of the future and there has   never been can speak to Laura you can   speak to any there has never been a   movement like that and what we're doing   in the history of this country some   people say some of these people say some   of these people who are not exactly   thrilled with me say that it's the   single greatest political phenomena   they've ever seen this is a big crowd   but everywhere this big though   everywhere they're big crowds   people wanted to end and we cannot have   four more years of Barack Obama and I   think she'll be worse I actually think   that Hillary will be worse we're   fighting for every community whose jobs   and dreams have been ripped out and   shipped out to other countries we're   fighting for every American who believe   government should serve the people not   the donors and not the special interest   once more we will have a government of   By and For the People I'm asking you to   dream big

very smart people some smaller than   others in office great people great   people mostly endorsing us Ben Carson's   been so active been so good so many   great people so many great people but   one by one and they said Donald Trump   you know he has no experience that this   stuff he's going against governors and   Senators I said yeah but we all sort of   know how to win right right and one by   one bum-bum-bum 1716 1210 hey never   saying what's going on yet this is very   strange anyway we ended up getting the   most votes in the history of the   Republican primary system by far by far

I   kept sort of looking I said man that's a   lot of debate prep that's been going on   you understand that that's been going on   for I mean like a week and a half of   debate prep she's been doing this up for   like 35 years debate prep it wasn't true   it was just a way that you could rest   and sleep a little bit more she wasn't   debate prepping and by the way who won   the debates who yeah   and you know it was only after that last   debate that our numbers started shooting   up like a rocket ship people don't   realize that take a look was after the   last debate that our numbers because   about four weeks ago they were saying   Trump looks like you could be having a   problem we had the debate and then we're   look at the numbers and now you look at   the states and you look at the polls and   they are not happy they are not we're   going to have such an exciting night on   Tuesday night so we're one day away from   the change you've been waiting for your   entire life

 Mexico and other countries and take your   jobs with them   we're going to stop the jobs from   leaving North Carolina we're going to   start making things again in America we   are going to make things again   the jobs theft that's what it is we'll   end the day i start the presidency   believe me it's going to be america   first again remember that America first   you don't hear that anymore it's not   America first now that we know that way   now early voting is underway so make   sure you get out and vote and by the way   north carolina we're doing really well   you see what's happening   the dishonest media back there they're   going what is happening they're seeing   the lines of people they're seen crowds   like this look at this crud now they   don't mention the crowds ever but they   see him they know what's going on they   look at Florida have you seen Florida   what's going on   they have lines going to the voters   polls to the booths that are four blocks   long in Florida and there are an awful   lot of red hats and buttons and Trump   shirts and generally speaking those   people do not vote for crooked Hillary   Clinton   [Music]   what group I love North Carolina you   know I have a great property near   Charlotte very successful that means I   pay a lot of people I pay a lot of   employees but i'll tell you what we have   great people this is a great great state   and we're going to make it even better   we're bringing back your jobs   seventy-five percent of the american   people think our country's on the wrong   track that's an easy one to figure isn't   it we're going to fix it and we're going   to get our country back on the right   track and it's going to happen very   quickly real change begins with   immediately repealing and replacing the   disaster known as Obamacare   that one's not even close and Hilary   wants to double up and triple up what a   disgusting situation and it was no good   it was no good the day it was conceived   remember Jonathan Gruber of MIT he said   the American people is stupid to have   approved it unfortunately they had an   iphone going you know that's nice it has   just been announced that Americans are   going to experience another massive   double-digit spike in Obamacare premiums   including more than a one hundred and   eighteen percent increase for people in   the great state of Arizona so you think   you have it bad in Arizona they're up to   a hundred and eighteen percent don't   feel bad you're going to get yours to   you through the roof also but think of   it numerous places over a hundred   percent even Bill Clinton admitted that   Obamacare is quote the craziest thing in   the world where people lined up with   premiums doubled and their coverage cut   and a half job-killing Obamacare is just   one more way the system is rigged system   is rigged folks it's already   so when Gruber made that statement a lot   of things happened and a lot of people   started looking at Obamacare very   closely and i will tell you hillary   clinton came out and she wants to double   down and make it where she's good it's   going to be so much worse frankly can we   live another four years with another   obama i don't think so i don't think so   and I think she'll be worse and remember   the Supreme Court just put in the back   you mind Supreme Court but we can't take   another four years of Obama and that's   what we're getting with Hillary more   than half a million North Carolinians   have been forced into Obamacare they   didn't want it they were forced premiums   have gone up in North Carolina by double   digits and this year they're going to go   up at a record number it is catastrophic   more than 250,000 people in North   Carolina are losing their health plans   next year 95 of the state's 100 counties   will only have one insurance company to   buy from good luck in that negotiation   folks they are in a very good position   hey who's that terrier I want to know I   want a piece of that insurance company   drain the swamp look at that sign drain   the swamp and Washington DC look at that   you know I said to somebody the other   day and even today drain the swamp we   put it in about two days ago so drained   the swamp I didn't like it I didn't like   the expression drain the swamp in   Washington so I said it three days ago   the place went crazy I said you know   what I'm starting to like that   expression and now it's a hot expense   like trending all over the world drain   the swamp in Washington so we like we   like that expression Obamacare will   destroy the economy in health care of   North Carolina if we don't stop it fast   and I mean like immediately repealing   Obamacare and stopping Hillary Clinton's   health care takeover is one of the most   important reasons we must win on   november eighth we have to and next   we're going to rid Washington of   corruption it is Cora what about the   Hillary Clinton fiasco you ever seen   anything what about all the wiki leads   hillary bleeps listen to this we all   know but we're going to say because   nobody has ever gotten away with crimes   and I mean crimes like Hillary Clinton   has gotten away with   you   Hilary bleach and deleted 33,000 emails   after getting a subpoena she got a   subpoena from the United States Congress   she said whoa we have a problem she   deleted and bleached nobody bleaches   sophisticated people said we've never   heard of it you know why because it's   such an expensive process so she deleted   as he bleached 33,000 emails she lied to   Congress under oath she lied to the FBI   she made 13 phones disappear some with a   hammer who here has made your phone   disappear by hammering the hell out of   it oh we got to anybody else I want to   know sir what business are you in where   do you find that the business he said   and remember with the FBI she couldn't   remember 39 times all that means 39   lives right she couldn't remember 39   times he can remember other things but   not this the Clinton crew gave more than   six hundred and seventy-five thousand   dollars to the wife of the deputy FBI   director overseeing the investigation   into Hillary's illegal server   that's all right leeme alone at so you   know the great thing about that we have   a protester by the way we you paid   $1,500 to be a thug where's the   protester where is he was he paid hey   you can get him out get him out   [Applause]   out   you   folks did you see we're through   WikiLeaks we found out that Clinton was   paying people $1,500 plus an iphone to   go out and be violent at our rallies   okay it's a disgrace to disgrace but   I'll tell you what they found our people   of very tough they found that out so we   also found out that President Obama in   the emails knew about the server even   though he said he didn't the criminal   conduct of Hillary Clinton threatens the   foundations of our democracy there has   never ever been a situation like this   and the emails are just a part of it   we're going to turn it all around   I proposed a contract with the American   voter that will give the government back   to the people my contract begins with a   plan to end the rampant government   corruption and it is corrupted she's   perhaps the most corrupt person ever to   run for the office of President she   shouldn't be allowed to run she   shouldn't be allowed to run and by the   way remember just recently again the   emails WikiLeaks donna Brazile got two   questions for a debate got the questions   for a debate gave the questions to   Hillary Clinton donna Brazile is under a   lot of pressure Hillary Clinton did she   say oh gee I illegally got the questions   to the debate call up and have a little   conference and say I'm sorry I'm a very   honest person I can't do this no they   only found out about it months later   you're dealing with a very very   dishonest person I want the entire   corrupt Washington establishment two   here and two here and to heed the words   I am about to say if we win a november   eighth we are going to Washington DC and   we are going to drain the swamp   [Applause]   that includes a constitutional amendment   to impose term limits on all members of   Congress   at the very core of my contract with the   American people as a plan to bring back   American jobs we've had it we're going   to bring back our jobs and you really   know what I'm talking about in North   Carolina because you're one of the   greatest victims of all we're living   through the greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world the greatest think   of that the greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world not just here look   at new england look at new york state   look at pennsylvania in ohio look   everywhere North Carolina has lost   nearly half of its manufacturing jobs   since NAFTA can you believe it half half   of your jobs a deal signed by Bill   Clinton and supported strongly by   crooked Hillary remember every time you   see a closed factory or wiped out   community the Clintons really did this   to you NAFTA was a disaster but listen   to this I always say it looked like a   typo they made a mistake it can't be   possible we've lost seventy thousand   factories now I thought they meant 700   factors maybe 7,000 we've lost seventy   thousand factories since China entered   the World Trade Organization another   bill and hillary backed disaster the   trade policies of Hillary Clinton have   been devastating for workers unions   companies and communities throughout   North Carolina stanley furniture moved   its production from robbinsville laid   off 400 workers and move their jobs to   southeast asia in 2010 congratulations   Southeast Asia they wouldn't be doing it   if I was president   believe me when they say we want to send   our product whatever the hell they make   we want to send our product back into   the United States they said we'd love to   have your product thirty-five percent   tax let's see if you move they wouldn't   be moving they wouldn't be moving they   wouldn't be moving folks and the   politicians could have done that but   most of them are taken care of by   special interests and donors and the   other half for stupid people they don't   know what they're doing flex global   operations closed its plant in Charlotte   laid off 255 workers and move their jobs   to where most of the place goes they   move their company to a place called   Mexico that was this year degler trucks   of North America laid off 2771 workers   that's a lot in North Carolina in 2016   after opening a major plant in Mexico   steel casing shifted its production to   Mexico laid off 264 workers in North   Carolina in 2014 leviton i buy those   switches I'm not going to buy a mini   mart and realizes I buy a lot of Lebanon   switches I'm not buying him any more   clothes this light switch factory laid   off up to 200 people and move their jobs   to Mexico in 2009 dell closed its plant   in winston-salem and laid off up to   1,000 employees and move their jobs to   Mexico and other countries I have a   friend who builds plans he is i believe   the biggest in the world and i said how   are we doing he said Donald we're doing   fine how's your company unbelievable I   said how's this country our country the   country we love and he loves his country   he's an American how's it doing not good   I said well how are you doing well he   said I am building the greatest plants   anywhere in the world in Mexico   I said oh that's great that's wonderful   folks we're going to turn it around that   it's going to turn around so fast okay   it's going to turn around so fast under   my contract we will immediately bin and   we have to do this we have no choice and   it's going to be so much fun I love this   we will immediately begin renegotiating   NAFTA that has been a one-way highway   the money the jobs the plants the   factories leave our country we get   unemployment and drugs so we get the   drugs we get the unemployment they get   the cash the jobs the plants want to   disgrace and you know what people don't   even know it's very complex but they're   under a vat tax system so it's about a   17 almost seventeen percent so what   happens is every time we make a deal   because we have a different system we   pay 17 they pay nothing so the agreement   has been defective for years and nobody   ever changed it that's why you never see   anybody coming the opposite where it's   always jobs moving to Mexico you never   see because it's a defective contract   they signed a defective contract just   there you're at a 17-point disadvantage   before all of the other disadvantages   kick in does that make sense it's a   defective contract and nobody did   anything about it for years Oh are we   going to do something about it it's   going to be done and I met as you know   two months ago I met with the President   of Mexico nice guy nice guy and we can   have a very good relationship with   Mexico oh we're gonna build the wall   don't worry about this guy believe me   we're going to fill that we have to   build a wall we have to build the wall   we've got to stop the drugs from coming   into our country and poisoning our youth   we're going to build a wall one hundred   percent Mexico's going to pay for the   wall they don't know it yet but they're   going to pay for the wall believer but   their leaders their politicians are   smarter and sharper than our politicians   we use people to negotiate our deals the   biggest deals in the world like with   China what China does to this country is   unbelievable we use political hacks to   do our negotiating they have the   smartest people they have like this   pyramid right from the time they're in   first grade they take the smartest the   smartest this way by the time they get   to the top you're dealing with very   smart people unfortunately they're not   dealing with very smart people and we   have a massive almost 500 billion dollar   trade deficit with China we have an 800   billion dollar trade deficit with the   world that's all going to end folks   we're going to have free trade but we're   going to have fair trade it's going to   be fair it's going to be a two-way   street and with nap that we don't get   the deal we want we will terminate NAFTA   and get a much better deal for our   workers and for our companies 100% 100   person and if companies like carrier   want to fire their workers move to   Mexico or other countries you know   they're in Indianapolis they fired all   of their workers and it was right around   the time of the primer and boy I'll tell   you those workers were great they   followed me they went to so many of our   speeches and remember that was going to   be the great firewall that was going to   be where they were going to stop Trump   now I had Bobby Knight helping me that's   awfully good in India   the great Bobby does but we won Indiana   in a landslide and by the way speaking   of Indiana Governor Mike Pence great gun   great great guy good choice it's an   important choice did we pick better than   her by the way I watched their debate   that one wasn't close and neither was   mine with Hillary that we'd be her   better we beat her badly and he's so   biting today right oh I'd like to get   I'd like to get Donald behind the gym oh   I dream about that kind of stuff you   know mr. tough guy he eats a real he's a   real tough guy fucks I would dream about   that so they shipped their products back   into the United States see he ought to   be tough like that on trade he ought to   be tough like that on so many other   things where we getting ripped off he   ought to be tough like that in dealing   with the Veterans Administration because   our veterans are being treated so   unfairly   [Applause]   so we'll put on a tariff and believe me   they're not moving then companies like   Apple will start making their iPhones   and other products inside the United   States you watch you want are you watch   everything's in China and Vietnam I mean   you know they say Apple isn't that   wonderful but they make everything   outside they will start making product   and so will other of our great country   we will get companies to make product   inside the United States wouldn't that   be nice and by the way no ship big know   this I mean there are a lot of events   but we're going to get it as part of our   plan to bring back American jobs we will   lower taxes on our businesses from   thirty five percent down to fifteen   percent going from the highest tax   nation in the world to one of the lowest   i'd like to make it the lowest but you   can only go so far maybe someday we will   be a rich nation once again we will put   so many people back to work but to be a   rich country we must also be a safe   country crooked Hillary Clinton   unleashed Isis and unleash death and   suffering across the Middle East and now   the terrorism is spreading into our   country she wants in her words to have   totally open borders which would destroy   America's middle class and by the way   destroy our country when you have open   borders you know 600,000 people could be   if you look at it the kind of numbers   that they're talking about millions more   african-american incredible workers will   be put out of work they are so badly   affected by the policies of Obama and   Clinton and I don't even know if they   realize what they're doing hillary wants   to increase Syrian refugees by five   hundred and fifty percent coming into   this country   that's on top of the thousands and   thousands and thousands already coming   in and these are people we have no idea   who they are where they come from   believe me folks we are not doing that   the refugee plan would leave us with   generations of terrorism radicalism and   extremism inside of our shores a trump   administration is going to suspend   immigration from terror prone regions of   the world and will suspend the Syrian   refugee problem and let me state this as   clearly and nicely as I can if I'm   elected president I am going to keep   radical Islamic terrorists the hell out   of our country   [Applause]   i will also secure and defend the   borders of the united states and yes we   will build that wall that you're talking   about but also cancel all funding for   sanctuary cities horrible Hillary   strongly support sanctuary cities like   the one that killed Kate Steinle San   Francisco thousands of Americans have   been killed by illegal immigrants in   january of last year grant thrown about   21 years old magnificent young man was   working at a convenience store on Mesa   Arizona when he was viciously murdered   in cold blood shot point-blank by an   illegal immigrant with a long and   vicious criminal record people said   please don't let him into society they   did he killed grant violently another   American murdered in cold blood was 25   year old Spencer goal vac he was sitting   in his car at a stoplight after dropping   off his girlfriend on his way home an   illegal immigrant that a pickup truck   pulled up to him beside him and shot   Spencer directly in the head no warning   no talking no nothing no reason the   killer had a lengthy criminal record and   had been deported for x so many people   said don't let this man out get him back   to his country get him out of our   country the Obama administration refused   to do it I've spent a lot of time with   Spencer's mom Julie I have a message for   the cartels the drug dealers and the   gang members when I win your long reign   of crime and terror will come crashing   to an end quickly and we have to pay   tribute to our great people in law   enforcement these are great people that   are having a hard time right now and   they know where these people are by the   way when you hear the gang members the   drug lords all of these they know they   can tell you in one minute who should go   who doesn't have to go they know we got   some we got some bad ones will also   rebuild our badly depleted military with   the greatest people in the world but we   have a badly depleted military and we   can't beat Isis can you imagine Mosul   right most i've been saying this for a   long time and you know somebody like   Hillary Clinton well he says he doesn't   want to go into Mosul look folks first   of all mosa was already captured it was   the way we got out of Iraq we shouldn't   have gone into Iraq and we shouldn't   have gotten out the way we got out but   that's why we're going in now second   time but why can't we do it like   secretly right why can't we do this   quietly I've been reading about we are   going to attack Mosul now and you have   to for three months and I'm saying you   know the element of surprise right right   General George Patton the element of   surprise he didn't talk he got the job   done even after he got the job done he   didn't talk he didn't want to talk to   anybody the reporters wouldn't like him   very much use a little rough with   reporters you know these are the most   dishonest people I'm telling you these   are the most dishonest people on earth   and they are going crazy because they   put out these phony poles and then the   real polls come out so today Bloomberg   is appalled they're very disappointed   Trump is up in Florida by two points and   the lines are a lot more than two even   two points is forget it the lines are   through the roof same things happening   here you see what's happening here the   lines the lines was beautiful beautiful   lines right it's happening all over the   country happening all over but they're   very dishonest people General George   Patton was rough he was a rough guy but   his people would die for him but he was   a great general he wouldn't give notice   we are going to Mosul in three months we   will attack we will attack and some   clown from some Institute came out today   why is Donald Trump saying that about   muscle hey folks i will put my thought   process against these people any time   he's saying it's okay the way they did   it well it's turning out i just saw it   on television it's turning out that   mosul is very very tough to get and the   reason they wanted to get in is because   the leaders of Isis they felt were   living in Mosul but here's the thing   they were supposed to be the JV   according to Obama number they started   out as a little group a little band of   men this case men they started out as a   little band of men the JV became a   horrible horrible worldwide threat and   now they are ensconced in 32 nations and   then I hear Hillary Clinton who I call a   very low energy person   she's going out now she's going up and   saying what does Donald Trump know about   this look folks when you're looking to   take out the people that are leaders of   Isis and their ensconce and Mosul you   don't announce it three months before   you attack you use the element of   surprise and you knock the ah you say it   what's the word and you're not hell out   of them   [Applause]   boy oh boy what a bunch of amateurs we   have amateurs in the White House we have   amateurs as leaders and honestly I think   it's so there's so many things you get   whether it's the horrible trade deals   the loss of these jobs we have no growth   in this country you see that you see the   numbers are jobs numbers were announced   last week they were anemic anemic no   matter what we have our military is   depleted our vets aren't taken care of   we have stupid people leaving this   country there's stupid people you know   I'd like to use another word I went to   an Ivy League school I was a very good   student but there's nothing better than   the word stupid to describe these people   I mean there's just no better word i   know many words but we're going to   change that North Carolina will be a   major part of this rebuilding effort   with new advanced fighters flying from   seymour johnson air force base   [Applause]   [Music]   marine battalions at can't lose you   [Applause]   and here's a place that a few of you may   have heard of and a very very beautiful   replenish storming out of Fort Bragg   North Carolina is also the home to more   than 750,000 veterans and I told you the   veterans are loving Donald Trump they do   polls on the veterans I'm through the   roof we're going to take care of our   veterans for once and for all well it's   not going to be talk we're going to take   care of our veterans our greatest people   we're going to give our veterans the   right to see their doctor of their   choice they're not going to be waiting   in line for nine days dying 22 suicides   a day these are all great people 22   think of that that's an impossible   number also to even conceive 22 suicides   a day they wait in line for four days   five days six days to see a doctor a   simple procedure or a simple   prescription could solve their problem   they don't get to see the doctor so they   could have the right if this happens to   walk across the street see a private   doctor go to a private hospital or   public hospital get themselves fixed up   and the United States will pay for the   bill and it's the cheapest thing we can   do and it's the best thing we can do   [Applause]   the veterans love Trump and Trump loves   the veterans believe you better get out   and vote you better get out and vote   veterans because we're dealing with a   bad person we will also change our   foreign policy and by the way speaking   of the veterans she said the veterans   are being serviced just fine you know   that right she is going to do nothing   for the veterans and she's going to hurt   your social security big league but she   is going to do nothing for the veterans   Hillary Clinton gave us Isis and through   the middle east into turmoil do you   notice she gave us Isis she did her and   Obama now she's telling you I am going   to get rid of Isis what the hell did you   let him do this in the first place for   she's been there for 30 years it's all   talk with her nothing ever happens Libya   Syria New York State is a disaster she   said she was going to bring back jobs it   turned out to be just the opposite so   now she wants to start World War three   in Syria against the nuclear-armed   Russians great right you ever notice how   tough she talks about Putin somebody   said to me today very smart person great   business person called up and said you   know I heard her saying about Donald   Trump and Russia first I don't know   Putin have no business whatsoever with   Russia have nothing to do with Russian   and you know they like this every time   WikiLeaks comes they say this is a   conspiracy between Donald Trump and   Russia give me a break you know number   one they don't even know it's Russia who   knows it might be Russia could be China   could be if you remember Sony it could   be it could be North Korea it could be a   lot of places but you know she always   likes her in the meantime she gave   Russia twenty percent of our Europe the   uranium right she gave them twenty   percent of our uranium you know what   uranium is used for for a massive   payment and Podesta has some big deal in   Russia   and they always like to talk about John   but we learned a lot about them from   WikiLeaks we learned in the emails she   said and she has terrible terrible   instincts okay so John Podesta her top   person who I wouldn't want working for   me at say he said so many bad things   about her who Minds you mind if any of   your people like you have a top job and   you have a person and they call you like   not a smart person your bed instincts   you don't know what you're doing I mean   I gotta have a couple of these but John   Podesta said terrible things about her   but one of the things he said that was   to me the words that she has bad   instincts so she's got bad it's things   from her top person Bernie Sanders says   she is bad judgment so who wants a   president with bad instincts and bad   judgment by the people that know them   the better what are we doing here all of   the following quotes come from I the   Podesta or colon Paulo look he's another   guy he did a great job right with Iraq   there's a guy colon pal he did a great   job with a rat they wanted to get away   with it that was one of the quotes they   wanted to get away with it you know the   whole email scandal her instincts are   terrible apologies are like her Achilles   heel these are all statements made about   her she's totally programmed she looked   program she has no opinion sometimes   that would be a good thing in her case   [Music]   unbridled ambition and greedy everything   Hillary Rodham Clinton touches she kind   of screws up oh that's wonderful that   makes us feel good right to all   Americans I say it is time for new   leadership let's get the Clintons out of   our lives   [Applause]   everything will change in November just   think about what we can accomplish in   the first 100 days we are going to have   the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan   we will eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation which is   destroying our businesses we will   provide school choice and put an end to   common core we're going to bring   education local we will rebuild our very   depleted military and we will take care   of our vents we will support the men and   women of law enforcement we're going to   save is a big one for North Carolina   we're going to save our very very   troubled Second Amendment it is under   seas and we will appoint justices to the   United States Supreme Court who will   uphold and defend the Constitution of   the United States today I was in   Washington DC where I just finished   building this is before I started   running for president okay just so young   but I have a great grade the best   probably the best piece of land in   Washington one of the great pieces of   land the old post office and I'm very   proud of its great building we built it   into a hotel it's on Pennsylvania Avenue   right between the Capitol building and   the White House right smack in the   middle if you're in the real estate   business is an expression always try and   get the post office because they were   there first it's the best locate so it's   this incredible building and we had the   opening of Trump International Hotel now   I've been campaigning and you've seen   that in fact even the press is amazed   they are exhausted they follow me seven   stops eight stops five stops three or   four of these a day with crowds last   night we had 25,000 people in Florida we   had 19   thousand we had 12,000 we have the   biggest Grouch because you know what we   have a movement like nobody has ever   seen before nobody the pundits Bill   O'Reilly but many of the pundits said   it's the greatest single greatest   political phenomena they've ever seen so   I built this building now you have to   understand I never practically go home I   work all the time Hillary goes makes a   little speech she reads your   teleprompter gets in a plane goes home   and start sleeping for three days so you   know what I thought I'd do my kids were   charged evanka Don and our good kids   they're good so I thought I'd take an   hour or two and run in and cut the   ribbon with them at the building to show   you how low she is she comes out it says   Donald Trump took time off from the   campaign to open a hotel up now she'll   do one stop I'm telling you she wants to   sleep all the time this is not what we   need this is not what we need as a   president she's a very low energy person   I saw it in the last debate I think she   did very poorly in the last debate and   then she was so exhausted she barely   made it to the car that's not what we   need to negotiate with China okay that's   not what we did but she said I took time   off and I'm saying to myself this is   that a terrible thing where we're out   working her many many more subs many   more everything don't go home she's home   all the time she takes many days off and   then she said that then she said I used   illegal immigrants to build the building   except I didn't use one for two reasons   number one I didn't want to and number 2   i'm running for president why would I   would I do that so I went with the   e-verify system we didn't have one   illegal   immigrant on the job everybody knows it   nobody was hard and believe me we could   have hired plenty they're all over the   place they are all over the place and I   would have saved probably a lot of money   right but I have the e-verify system I   didn't hire one illegal immigrant to   build Trump International Hotel on   Pennsylvania view and then I see her and   then I see crooked Hillary said he used   illegal immigrants they will say   anything folks but the reason I did it   two things when you have good children   you have children good or bad you want   to support your children my children   worked very hard on that project I   wanted to be with them to cut the ribbon   but the other reason the other reason I   went there is because it was brought in   under budget and ahead of schedule   something this country never heard about   we have a hospital a VA hospital where   it was supposed to cost like 600 million   it's going to cost 1.4 billion but that   stand of roads that caused double triple   quadruple bridges that are a desert   everything's a disaster so I went in and   I said you know what I'm going to do it   and we built it under budget ahead of   schedule and that was the name of the   news conference under budget and ahead   of schedule and we built a great hotel   and I wanted to be with my kids to   salute them and to congratulate them on   doing a great job I then flew in to   another great section of North Carolina   we had another great talk and we've had   a lot of fun but I just want to set the   record straight all eve arif I know   illegal immigrants no help in that   regard and we have a great thing and   including construction we put literally   thousands of people to work and that's a   great thing because that's what our   country needs but remember under budget   and a   schedule okay so Americans are tired of   being told what we can do what we can't   do and what can't be done that's all we   hear they're tired of being asked to   defer their dreams to another day and to   another decade which is really what they   mean everywhere I go in this country all   i see is untapped potential waiting to   be set free and a great example of that   is the african-american community   they've been treated so unfairly so   unfairly and we're going to fix our   inner cities we're going to fix them   african-american communities Hispanic   communities we're going to work on the   inner cities because what Hilary and the   groups have done give me your vote give   me your vote and then after the election   see you I'll see you in four years   that's all they do we're going to fix   our inner cities we're going to bring   jobs back to our inner cities and safety   back and education back to our inner   cities and we're going to do great with   the african-american community we're   going to do great with a Hispanic   community in the election but we will   never realize that potential if we   continue putting our faith in a broken   political system that has let us down   time and time again let's close the   history books on the failures in   Washington and let's open a new chapter   of success and prosperity I'm asking all   Americans to join me in dreaming big   remember what we used to dream big we   don't dream big anymore we want big bold   dreams for our future I'm going to fight   for every American in every part of this   nation I'm going to fight for every   person in this country who believes   government should serve the people not   the donors and not the special interests   I'm going to fight to bring us together   as one great nation we are a divided   nation right now just imagine what our   country could accomplish if we started   working together as one people under one   God saluting one American flag just   think about once again we will have a   government of By and For the People   together we will make America wealthy   again together we will make America   strong again together we will make   America safe again and we will make   America great again thank you very much   thank you   Oh   [Music]   I the LORD hath loosed the day for my   t-cog his hair loss before   [Music]

U8XK5ByebOc~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161104~Full Speech: Donald Trump Rally in Atkinson, New Hampshire (11/4/2016) Trump Live Atkinson NH Speech~8453.0~4.84455966949~371.0~15.0~   a winner until now he's had to do it all   by himself against all odds but this   week with this United Party he's got   back   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you   thank you very much thank you folks you   know this is where it all began New   Hampshire this is where it all began   first victory this was our first victory   at I've never forgot that and I made a   promise you we're gonna keep the poison   out you know what that is the drugs   we're gonna stop those drugs right right   here is where I learn more about it than   anyplace else and we are going to stop   the poison from coming in to this   country you watch you watch in four days   we're going to win the great state of   New Hampshire and we are going to win   back the White House and we've had   incredible polls you've probably seen   the new RESCUE simple just came out with   three points up nationwide and going   like a rocket many many polls I won't   even go over all the polls but we're   leading in Ohio and Iowa and all over   the place I think we're doing great in   North Carolina I think we're doing great   in Pennsylvania too by the way and   Florida looks beautiful Florida looks   beautiful we have so many great falls   but you have to get out and vote in   november eighth you have to do that   we're on the cusp of historic change   that transfers power from a failed   political establishment and returns that   power to you the American people that's   what's going to happen that's what's   gonna happen   there's some more breaking news as you   probably heard that I'd like to share   with you right now telephone as you know   the FBI now has multiple open criminal   investigations into Hillary Clinton it's   includes the discovery of another   650,000 emails and also a far-reaching   criminal investigation into her   pay-for-play scheme at the State   Department last night CBS News just   confirmed that the six hundred and fifty   thousand emails include brand new emails   not previously seen by authorities she   said she gave him all in right she said   gave them all in well when we saw   650,000 we figured I guess that has to   be some surprises when you see what they   find in those 652 it won't be pretty   Hillary Clinton lied to Congress under   oath when she said she turned over all   of her work-related emails and that she   didn't send classified information on   her illegal server meaning she may now   face major problems for perjury how can   Hillary manage this country when she   can't even manage her emails did you   ever see hey folks let's forget all of   this stuff what a mess one of us and all   she had to do is follow the rules and   assume people are watching or listening   who cares right what a mess and for what   now we're going to have her running the   country for four years what it honestly   what a terrible terrible mess over over   what over nothing over what should have   been nothing what she had to do is   follow the rules unbelievable   and now she's going to run the country   she'll be under investigation for years   she'll be with trials our country we   have to get back to work right well one   of her top people I guess her top person   said this WikiLeaks said that she has   bed instincts what a bad thing bad   instincts she should fire him honestly   that would be good insects but she   should fire him John Podesta in an email   said Hillary has bed instincts do you   want that for your president and Bernie   Sanders said Bernie Sanders said bad   judgment but in all fairness he was   running against her so he said bad   judgment but the guy that's running a   campaign says Hillary really has bad   instincts then we're going to say oh   let's make a president the FBI agents   say their investigation is likely to   yield an indictment however the report   also showed that the political   leadership at the Department of Justice   is trying as hard as it can to protect   their angel Hillary Clinton why didn't   they protect general Cartwright and why   didn't they protect General Petraeus and   why didn't they protect a kid has taken   a couple of pictures of a submarine   that's an old submarine and they put him   in jail they put him in jail lovely   family lovely mother they put him in   jail because he wanted to have some   remembrance of where he worked the old   submarine believe me they have pictures   of that submarine that nobody knows   about probably right they put him in   jail and you see what she does and she's   allowed to run for president hey folks   folks and you know what it tells you the   system's rigged and I've been saying   that for a long time   Systems wreck she shouldn't be allowed   to run Hillary has engaged in a massive   criminal enterprise and cover up she   created an illegal email server to   shield her criminal activity and corrupt   pay-for-play she illegally transmitted   confidential information nothing you   just not allowed to do that forget about   the second go-around which she's in now   the first go-around you're not allowed   to do it you're not allowed to delete   after you get a subpoena she illegally   destroyed federal records including   33,000 emails which he deleted after   getting that subpoena from Congress if   she were to win that would create an   unprecedented constitutional crisis what   a mess I mean we went through it with   him with the impeachment of the lies   aren't we tired of this stuff she's   likely to be under investigation for a   long time concluding in a criminal trial   a president America deserves a   government that can go to work on day   one get it done real change begins with   immediately repealing and replacing the   disaster known as Obamacare   [Applause]   and Obama's you know he's campaigning   all over the place I left Miami   yesterday there was the play and he's   campaigning campaign he ought to be in   the White House working and getting our   jobs back and building up our military   and creating some semblance of a border   which we don't have now it's just been   announced that Americans nationwide are   going to experience a massive   double-digit premium hike in Obamacare   in the great state of Arizona we're just   left prima and I'll be back premiums are   going up more than one hundred and   sixteen percent Arizona 116 percent over   ninety percent of the counties in New   Hampshire are losing Obamacare they're   losing the insurers and that's going to   be next year so lots of luck negotiating   folks ninety percent premiums are   surging companies are leaving insurers   are fleeing doctors acquitting and   deductibles are going through the roof   other than that as a fantastic algebra   fantastic it's really fabulous isn't it   it was it was bad before they ever did   it I you have to say I'm pretty good old   a lot of things over the years right but   I said Obamacare is not going to work   before it was even approved and they got   it approved he got it approved my lives   because he said you keep your doctor   keep your plan and even Democrats it   didn't want it they said all right well   then and he got people they wish they   didn't approve it now believe me it's it   is a catastrophe yet Hillary Clinton   wants to double down on Obamacare making   it even more expensive than it already   is and it doesn't work I'm asking for   your vote so we can replace Obamacare   and save health care for every family in   New Hampshire and every family in this   country   [Applause]   real change also means restoring honesty   to government my contract with the   American voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption of which this   claim first thing we have to do is keep   Hillary Clinton out of office that'll be   that'll be that'll be a good start I   want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment to hear and heed the words   we all of us together about to say when   we win on november eighth we are going   to Washington DC and we are going to   drain a swamp   [Applause]   thank you okay thank you very much at   the core of my contract is my plan to   bring back our jobs that time the   terrible jobs report that just came out   shows the number of people not in the   workforce increased by another four   hundred and twenty-five thousand people   last month that's why you see these   phony numbers about five percent   unemployed people are stopping they're   not looking for work anymore because   they can't get a job then they take them   off the rolls these numbers are an   absolute disaster labor force   participation has fallen to its lowest   level in nearly 40 years that's what's   happening nearly one in four people in   their prime working years are not   working they want to work they're not   working after eight years Obama is the   first president in modern history not to   have a single year of three percent   growth we're growing at an average of   probably one to two percent nobody even   knows and nobody believes the numbers   anyway the numbers they put out a phony   as far as I cuz it for millions of   Americans it's an economic nightmare New   Hampshire's was one in four of its   manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal   signed by Bill Clinton and supported by   Hillary Clinton this is the one that's   hardest to believe of all America has   lost seventy thousand factories since   China entered the World Trade   Organization you people don't New   England what do you know it another bill   and hillary back disaster we are living   through the greatest jobs theft in the   history of the world and that's what it   is when you think we have a one-way   highway right into mexico and these   other places they take our jobs they   take our money they take our cash you   know we get out of it drugs and   unemployment it's going to end don't   worry about it folks don't even think   about it   don't forget it i have to say this   because I tell the story all over the   place I learned so much in New Hampshire   because I see this place it's so   beautiful to me it's one of the most   beautiful places on earth you nice   beautiful winding roads even the roads   everything so the trees and the little   lakes and streams i sat down because I   have so many friends up here because I   worked hard during those primers   remember I was supposed to lose the   primary I won in a landslide right   number they had the story the day before   it looks like Trump could lose New   Hampshire and the numbers come out it   was a landslide but what I learned is   because it was so it was sort of   shocking because I consider it you know   i love this kind of look and i consider   with the trees and the whole thing I   it's so beautiful and I sat down with   groups of people you know wasn't always   big rallies because I'd sit down with   people say what's the problem every   single group said heroin I said heroin   because it didn't make sense to me you   know you look at the streams and the   lakes the trees and then this is a   heroin and it was shocking that's why   I've never forgotten it I never forgot   those meetings and every single group   and then I met with your place you have   the great you have such great law   enforcement up here but they said to say   and so much of their crime is caused by   drugs that come from the southern border   largely and I said to you I said to you   and you remember this if I make it we   are going to stop that problem and then   we're going to work on all of the people   who is so seriously addicted and there   are things happening you know there are   things happening with medicines that the   federal FDA is not even releasing   they're not even releasing there are   things that are coming out that   potentially could really help but we're   going to work on the people that have   become so seriously addicted because   this tremendous it's not only our youth   you know I say poisoning our youth but   it's a lot of other people but I learned   that from New Hampshire then I go to   other states and it's a very similar   things but honestly never with as much   fervor as drugs in New Hampshire and it   just really had a great impact and I   said you I'm going to solve the problem   if I get there and boy are we getting   close now we're getting 12   through we're going to solve it when you   see the rusted-out factories and empty   buildings just remember this Hillary   Clinton's policies and others like her   her friends did this to us all of us   just look at the devastation Rockwell   laid off 169 people in Manchester and   move their jobs to Mexico Fisher these   are recent Fisher Scientific later of   213 workers in Hudson and move their   jobs to Mexico the woman I just   overheard her say oh I didn't know that   right now you know now you know see she   was a little louder than she thought   that's okay she didn't know it's now she   knows cock component technologies later   559 workers in Bedford and move their   jobs to Canada into Mexico a trump   administration will stop the jobs from   leaving America believe me and we will   stop the jobs from leaving New Hampshire   the theft of American prosperity will   end they've taken away our prosperity   from now on it's going to be America   first   they'll be consequences there'll be   consequences if a company wants to fire   their workers leave New Hampshire move   another you know to another country   wonderful enjoy yourself right and then   ship their products back into the United   States they will pay a 35-percent texts   okay and let me just tell you a little   right now they move they build they have   lots of fun and they just send it right   through a very weak border first of all   they're gonna have to send through a   very strong border but that's okay but   they can have a thirty-five percent tax   here's what's going to happen they're   not going to move because it doesn't   work anymore they're not going to move   they're going to stay in this country   they're going to stay in New Hampshire   they're going to stay in this country   it's so simple but the politicians will   never approve that because the special   interest of their donors want them to be   able to go and you know what's good for   them but it's not good for us a trump   administration will renegotiate NAFTA   and if we don't get the deal we want we   will terminate NAFTA and get a much   better deal for our workers we have to   have jobs you know I said before it's a   one it's a one lane highway we have to   have a lane coming in our direction to   folks we get nothing we get nothing we   will also immediately stop the   job-killing trans-pacific partnership   that's going to be the next disaster   it's another beauty that'll take the   jobs you have left as part of our plan   to bring back jobs we are going to lower

they're making it   impossible they make it it for the   miners for the fishermen they're making   it impossible for the steelworkers with   all the dumping of steel all over the   place we will become a rich nation again   a truly rich nation   some people think that doesn't sound   nice it's not politically correct we   have to but to be a rich nation we must   also be a safe nation Hillary Clinton   wants a five hundred and fifty percent   increase in Syrian refugees flowing into   account   that over and above the thousands and   thousands being led in right now by   Obama her plan would mean generations of   terrorism extremism and radicalism   spreading into your schools and   throughout your communities when I'm   elected president we will suspend the   Syrian refugee program and we will keep   radical Islamic terrorists the hell out   of our country sorry have no choice we   have no choice and we all have a heart   and we'll build safe zones and Syria   will help them we all have a heart but   we see what's happening to Germany into   France and to all of these hood it's a   disaster it's a disaster look at nice   this summer look at what's going on in   Paris and all of these all of these   different places we're going to work but   where you know we owed 20 trillion   dollars we're not going to spend the   money I'll get the Gulf states to put up   the money they have tremendous money   they need us to have to step up to the   plate they need us we'll get them to put   up the money will leave the effort and   we'll build safe zones all over Syria   and we'll take care of it we'll get   other people to pay will get other   people to park   [Applause]   who said that who that statement could   only be made in New Hampshire I have to   fold you people Wow   oh the press hears that statement you'll   be in trouble but somehow I think he'll   be able to handle it a trump   administration will also secure defend   the borders of the United States and yes   we will build a great wall we received   the first-ever endorsement from our ice   and Border Patrol officers we will work   with them these are great people by the   way would have been a lot easier if they   didn't look if Hillary got in all they   have to do is stand there and let people   walk right in front of these are great   people they know what's happening to our   country they see what's happening to our   country we will work with them to stop   the drugs from pouring into New   Hampshire throughout the country and   poisoning our youth the immigration   office is warned at a letter that   Hillary's plan is the most radical   immigration proposal in US history and   that will lead to the loss of thousands   and thousands of lives it's a quote from   them as Secretary of State Hillary   Clinton allows many many people she   allowed so many people the most   dangerous and violent criminal aliens to   go free because their home countries   very intelligently wouldn't take them   back we get these people that weren't   supposed to be here that are violent   criminals drug dealers gang members   heads of gangs we put them in a plane we   send them back their countries say we   don't want them we don't want we're not   taking them they'd call the Secretary of   State or her or her people they won't   take them back that's okay bring them   back let them out and then they kill   people okay or they do other things that   are very bad I promise you that when we   deport some real bad ones there will   never be a time when that plane or   whatever form of transportation they   want to is there will never be a time   when that plane comes back with that   person sitting on the toilet   ever never happened they don't respect   us these other countries don't have   respect Hillary supports totally open   borders there goes your country and   strongly supports sanctuary cities like   San Francisco where Kate Steinle was   murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported at least five times a trump   administration will cancel all federal   funding to sanctuary cities we will end   illegal immigration stop the drugs from   pouring into our country to port all   criminal aliens and save so many   American lives we will also reap and   let's say it's just like doesn't it make   sense we will also repeal the   obama-clinton defense II question and   rebuild our badly depleted military   greatest people on earth the greatest   people our Navy is the smallest it's   been listen to this how sad and then you   see China and the South China Sea   building their fortresses and taking our   money they take our money and they build   their fortresses and we'll have a great   relationship I have a great relationship   with China made a lot of money dealing   with China Chinese terrific look deal   with John is great but I'm and I'm not   angry a China for doing this stuff I'm   angry at our people for allowing it to   happen our Navy the smallest it's been   since World War one you believe that we   will build the 350 ship Navy that our   country needs and really is requesting   which means lots more work for the   Portsmouth Naval Shipyard   great shipyard not too busy but it's a   great ship will make it busy and you   know things like that number one we're   building up our defense it also puts our   great people to work right it's great we   will also expand the center of   excellence at Portsmouth to recruit a   large number of skilled craftsmen like   pipe fitters and welders that we need to   expand our fleet I'm honored to have the   endorsement of more than 200 top   Admirals in general and 22 medal of   honor recipients I was with them last   near Fort Bragg we were right near Fort   Bragg last night we had some amazing   people we had over 20,000 people it was   the most unbelievable evening and we had   tremendous numbers of Admirals and   generals and we had a lot of Medal of   Honor winners amazing who was an amazing   evening our new foreign policy will put   America first you haven't heard that for   a long time Hillary brought death and   disaster to Iraq Syria Libya she   empowered Iran and she Unleashed Isis   now she wants to start a shooting war in   Syria in conflict and it's in conflict   with a nuclear-armed Russia that could   seriously lead to World War three I   think she's an unstable person to start   off with I really feel I think she's   unstable   you   Oh   [Music]   you   she and Obama created it through the   vacuum Hillary   wars that never end wars that we never   win and now it's in worse shape than   it's ever been before and we have to   rebuild our country folks we could have   rebuilt our country twice and the Middle   East now is far worse than it was when   we started this whole mess they've   dragged us into foreign wars that have   made us less safe and they've left our   borders wide open at home isn't it   interesting how we fight for other   people's borders lose our lives the   lives the money the most important of   the lives the great lives will lose   lives the money and yet we want to have   open borders right explain that we fight   for borders for other countries half the   people never heard of these other   countries they want borders and then we   leave our borders open and they've   shipped our jobs and they've shipped our   wealth to other countries to all   Americans I say it is time for new   leadership we need change we need change   the last thing we need is four more   years of Obama with Isis   yeah that's really nice I think we're   gonna have a great great day on Tuesday   in New Hampshire you know one of the big   commentators political commentators is I   thought I'd say it's only good for your   ego but just said whoever wins New   Hampshire is going to win it's   interesting why she said you'll win by   five only five I want one of them let's   win Justin concluded just think about   what we can accomplish in the first 100   days of a trump administration we're   going to have the biggest tax cut since   Ronald Reagan and maybe beyond and   hillary wants to raise your taxes we're   going to eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation killing   businesses we will cancel every illegal   obama executive order we are going to   protect religious liberty   rebuild our military and

turnout   this is this is big stump   and a poll just came out Wall Street   journal/nbc we're leaving ohio by one or   two points polygonum win we are going to   win   thank you everybody I gave a speech   earlier today on the lies corruption and   false accusations of the crooked Hillary   Clinton campaign and the mainstream   media which they control and use quite   viciously they want to distract us from   WikiLeaks it's been amazing what's   coming out on wikileaks they want to   keep us from talking about the issues we   will not let that happen we're going to   talk about the real issues which is jobs   and illegal immigration and our depleted   military and taking care of our vets   and our Second Amendment and our Supreme   Court judges   and the repeal and replacement of   Obamacare don't forget that   which is a disaster every day between   now and the election we're going to talk   about our plans to make America great   again   in 26 days we're going to defeat the   corrupt establishment and we are going   to save the United States of America we   are going to say   the United States and we are going to   show the whole entire beautiful world   how much we love our country it's going   to be again America first it's been a   long time America first   twenty-one thousand people tonight kitty   twenty one thousand   and you got 7,000 people outside trying   to get in but they're not gonna make it   I give we're going to renegotiate our   absolutely terrible trade deals reduce   surging crime cut taxes and regulation   lift the restrictions on American energy   end common core   reduce the cost of college make child   care more affordable and repeal and   replace that horrible thing the   so-called Affordable Care Act Obamacare   which is not affordable at all   and the governor of Minnesota just   minutes ago announced that the   Affordable Care Act is not affordable   and Bill Clinton admitted the other day   that it's a crazy system and I've been   saying this for years and Bill Clinton   suffered last week he made that   statement and he actually told the truth   he had a rough evening I want to tell   you that I've been talking about how   it's not going to work before it was   even passed and it was a past if you   remember it was passed with a big lie 28   times keep your plan keep your doctor   over and over and over and we have a   real mess on our hands where the cost is   going up seventy two percent 78% next   year it will be over a hundred percent   it's a disaster we've got to repeal it   replace it it's no good our president is   incompetent believe me he's incompetent   and every time I see him lately he's   campaigning for crooked Hillary he   shouldn't be campaigning he ought to be   working on the border he ought to be   working on illegal immigration he would   have been working on bringing our jobs   back from Mexico and all of these places   that have taken our jobs he is a   disaster very importantly we're going to   get our economy growing again and   growing fast my economic agenda can be   sent and you know this and I think   you've heard us we want an agenda that   really is represented by what three   words go ahead jobs jobs jobs and people   aren't going to take our jobs and   countries are no longer going to be   taking our jobs there will be   consequences there will be a price to   pay   and one of the hardest hit has been the   state of Ohio manufacturing jobs your   steel jobs your miners are going to be   protected your miners are going back to   work that i can tell you   this election is a simple choice it's a   choice between putting our faith in   failed politicians and she is a failed   politician look at what she's done   everything she touches I'm going to be   very nice turns bad see I've learned or   putting our faith in you the American   people which is what we're going to do   this is a great movement that we've   created together a movement like has   never been seen in this country a   movement like they've never ever seen in   this country   never ever seen anything like this   and a november eighth we're all going   out to vote and we're going to have a   tremendous victory I think far greater   than some people are even predicting   because we're tired of corruption and   we're tired of incompetents and that's   what you get nobody wants four more   years of Obama and with Hillary Clinton   it'll even be worse   the Hillary Clinton documents released   by WikiLeaks just a little while ago   make it more clear than ever just how   much is at stake on november eighth the   corruption of the Clintons knows no   limits and we've known that for a long   time today wikileaks release new emails   from early 2015 from clinton campaign   staffers discussing how friendly hillary   was with attorney general Loretta Lynch   oh I'm shocked to hear them   this was only months prior to the   investigation of her illegal server and   the email server that gave foreign   governments access to our confidential   information think of this this comes on   the heels of the disclosures of the   kitten and you saw this disclosure the   Clinton campaign was colluding with the   State Department over the release of her   emails and revelations that the Clinton   campaign was colluding with Obama's   Department of Justice over the   investigation into Hillary's secret   server   there has never been anything like   what's happening in our country we've   never had a thing like this before and   it's a disgrace and they ought to be   ashamed of themselves and like I took   Hillary and told hilary the other day at   the debate which we did win quite easily   I will   look she's highly overrated believe me   you know she couldn't pass her bar exam   in Washington DC couldn't pass it she   failed she's an overrated person how   about during the debate I'm standing   there at my lectern not moving and she   walks in front of me right she walks in   front of   and she answers the question then she   walks right back right in front of me   and the next day I read in the   newspapers that I invaded her space do   you believe this me   but we have another debate coming up and   we'll do the same thing to her   yesterday new disclosures were made   showing again how Hillary Clinton's   pay-for-play works in 2010 saudia arabia   was looking to buy arms from the united   states in order to get the approval   clinton state department had to sign off   and they couldn't get it so what   happened what did saudi arabia dude they   paid bill clinton a fortune to do a   speech later that year Clinton State   Department signed off an arm deals   between the United States and Saudi   Arabia shocking shocking   Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000   emails after not before before would be   bad after is criminal it's criminal   after a congressional subpoena then made   13 iPhones disappear some with a hammer   as anybody used a hammer on their iPhone   he did what business are you in huh I   don't want to ask I don't want to know   she did that to cover up her crimes the   WikiLeaks documents show how the media   conspires and collaborates with Clinton   campaign including giving the questions   and answers to Hillary Clinton before a   debate I don't get him I want him I'm   angry at the Republicans they don't get   me the answers and the questions the   documents show how the DNC honestly   betrayed Bernie Sanders poor Bernie he   sold out if he wouldn't have sold out to   the devil he would have gone down in   political history as quite an important   man but he sold out and his people are   not happy and now with all of these   emails that they're finding and all of   these documents it's not a pretty   picture for Bernie looks bad looks bad   they really did rigged the system on   Bernie Sanders I'll tell you they rigged   this is the documents also show the   Clinton campaign says she has no core   she has no message what are we gonna do   she's got no message I have a message   you know what the messages make America   great   it's a good message and that's what   we're doing this for I didn't need this   folks believe me I built a great company   was having a lot of fun this isn't fun   you know many of the people although I   must say sort of is fun but   many of the people in this room we're   making more money 18 years ago than they   are now and they're working harder now   and in many cases you have two jobs so   you're working harder you're older and   you're making less but I'm older and I'm   working harder also so I don't feel bad   for anybody in the room we're all in the   same boat but it's going to pay off   because we're gonna turn our country   around return our control   what Hillary is instead is the hundreds   of billions of dollars he raised from   Wall Street special interest in fact the   email show Hillary has a private   position for Wall Street and a public   position a fraud for the voters she says   this to Wall Street she says this to the   bonus the emails also reveal how the   Clintons ripped off the wonderful people   of haiti doling out favors for their   friends and special interests so true   Americans have had it with the years and   decades of Clinton corruption and I will   tell you what happened with the Attorney   General of the United States Herrera   plane in Arizona when he was going to be   playing golf very hot I don't think he   was going to be playing God just   happened to me to happen to be on the   tarmac said oh gee let's say hello   stayed for 39 minutes had talked about   golf and his grandchildren he didn't   talk about golf and he didn't talk about   his grandchildren unless it was a minute   or two I would think he probably talked   about appointing her as the Attorney   General if Hillary wins this election   and you're not allowed to do that and   they were very embarrassed and they   thought it would be something where they   could sneak on and sneak off you know   I've had a plane for a long time I've   never had anybody stop it get on come   off on the tarmac does it happen and   then you have the director of the FBI   and some of the greatest people in the   world   some of the greatest people of really in   our country some of the great people are   in the FBI and based on what I read and   see and hear they are so angry at what   took place where they caught her called   she is a corrupt person she should not   be allowed to run for the presidency   she's a corrupt person   she should be locked up she should   and if I win I am going to ask my   Attorney General to appoint a special   prosecutor to look into her crimes   because what she did is a disgrace to   the United States of America   and we're also going to look in to the   investigation in other words we're going   to investigate the investigation because   what happened is it disgrace other   people their lives have been destroyed   for doing so much less and everybody   knows it you know when you delete   something or when you don't provide the   documents requested after after you get   a subpoena from the United States   Congress that's a criminal act that   alone forget about all of the other   things which are even worse in many ways   but that alone is a criminal act and now   as you heard last week two boxes of   information and emails are missing as of   last week what are we doing folks what   are we doing what are we living with   what are we living with this will   finally be the year where the American   people can say enough is enough   the cleanse are the past but we are all   going to be together a very bright   future   the new emails also show members of the   Clinton king viciously attacking   Catholics and evangelicals true   it's just the latest evidence of the   hatred that the Clinton campaign has for   faithful people in our country faithful   Americans Hillary Clinton thinks you're   deplorable and irredeemable and   irredeemable might be worse means you   can't help yourself I call you   hard-working American patriots and   together we are going to save our   country with the smartest with the best   we're gonna unify our country   these emails also revealed that Clinton   believed in global governance and   unlimited immigration into our country   speaking in secret to a foreign bank   Hillary Clinton said my dream is a   hemispheric common market there go your   jobs the rest of your jobs with open   trade and open borders hey she didn't   want to hear that she didn't want that   to get out behind closed doors when she   thought no one was listening she pledged   to dissolve the borders of the United   States of America's what's happening for   that's what's happened   we are going to have strong borders we   are going to have a great wall   and who is going to pay for that wall   one hundred percent they don't know it   yet but that doesn't now the Bexar goes   fine as I was there two months ago I met   with the President of Mexico very good   person and you know what we're going to   have a great relationship with Mexico   but right now they're leaders are too   smart for our leaders we have massive   trade deficits with Mexico they beat us   at the border they beat us with trade we   have massive trade deficits with China   they make our product and other   countries we don't make things any more   essentially but we're going to start   making things again we're going to start   making things again   we're gonna make them in Ohio believe me   we're gonna make them in Ohio Hillary   once and forever the American   independence that our soldiers fought   and died for to keep and protect us   either we win this election or we'll   lose our country and that's what's   happening that's your choice it's as   simple as that a trump administration   will secure and defend our borders   Hillary is so radical and immigration as   Secretary of State she refused to make   foreign countries take back their   criminal aliens I don't know if you know   what's gone on they would catch a   murderer they would catch a drug lord   they would catch some bad people top   gang members they bring them back into   their countries the countries would say   very intelligently we don't want him so   we'd bring them back she would put no   pressure of those countries we bring   them back and in many cases we just put   them right back on our streets where   they wreaked havoc wreaked havoc   i pry will get him over there and   they're not coming back I promise you   that promise promise away one such   killer who was set free on Hillary's   watch went on to kill a young American   girl named Cassie Chadwick the killer   who had already been convicted for   shooting a girl in the head should have   been sent home and should have never   been here in the first place instead he   was set free went on a rampage and   murdered casing Hillary Clinton should   be ashamed she should be ashamed she   also wants to increase Syrian refugees   coming into our country by five hundred   and fifty percent   [Applause]   this even though she admitted in private   according to wiki leaks just the other   day that she knows terrorists are trying   to infiltrate the refugee program which   they absolutely are Hillary support for   open borders with the Middle East will   give us the same problems as France all   you have to do is look on see what's   happening with Germany and so many other   countries with the multi-generational   terrorism embedded in our communities   all over all over the world and all over   our country so let me state this as   clearly and as nicely as I can I am   going to keep radical Islamic terrorists   the hell out of our country   at the same time we're going to   completely rebuild our very depleted   military that includes building a   state-of-the-art missile defenses in   which we need it's time when it comes to   keeping America safe I believe in three   very important words and we don't have   it now it's called peace through   strength but to be a strong country we   must also be a rich country sounds crass   but we got to be a rich country right   now we're a poor country we're a debtor   nation at the center of our economic   revival will be fixing our terrible   horrible incompetently negotiated trade   deals in our country 47 million   Americans are in poverty and 45 million   Americans are on food stamps amazing   right in this day and age this is the   legacy of President Obama and Hillary   Clinton no state has been hurt worse by   our trade deals to the state of Ohio I'm   going to bring back your jobs you're   going to have big expansion of your   existing companies and no more companies   are going to leave the state of Ohio   without there being serious economic   consequence for that company   the state of Ohio has lost one in three   manufacturing job since NAFTA signed by   Bill Clinton and supported heavily by   Hillary Clinton Hillary South Korea deal   also cost the united states another   hundred thousand jobs and do you   remember when Hillary Clinton ran for   the Senate in New York she said she was   gonna bring back two hundred thousand   jobs to upstate New York guess what more   and more and more companies left they   went to Mexico and other places she did   nothing but talk and that's all she's   doing now when she runs for president   she doesn't have the strength she   doesn't have the aptitude she doesn't   have what it takes if we're going to be   a great country again that I can tell   you one hundred percent   and you know what she's over in China if   she goes down in Tiananmen Square   they'll just leave her there they're   tough people just gonna leave her there   they're not gonna help her up they'll   say let her come up when she's ready   he's a tough people since China entered   the World Trade Organization another   bill and hillary back deal now listen to   this seventy thousand factories I   thought they meant 500-700 seven   thousand seventy thousand factories have   shut down or left the United States of   America 70,000   that's 15 factory's closing a day on   average in our country going to other   places we are living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world and it comes from our country   and goes to many others in particular   China Mexico Japan but plenty of   companies like carrier general electric   motor roll mattel Fiat Chrysler and so   many others are moving their jobs to   Mexico and now for just announced it's   moving all of its small car production   to Mexico also not good not good and I   will tell you this if I win when Ford   when carrier when these companies   announced that they want to leave fire   all of their American workers and go to   Mexico and in the case of Ford build a   two-million-dollar plant I will tell you   what's going to happen we will tell them   congratulations enjoy your new plant but   every time you make an air conditioning   unit or a small car or a big car or a   big truck and you want to send it into   the United States you can have a   thirty-five percent tax to pay a tower   now stronger   and they'll never move fuck shall never   move and if they do move that's okay too   because we're gonna make a fortune now a   lot of politicians aren't smart enough   to understand that and many do   understand it but they're taking care of   the companies that are moving its   corruption but they will not move and   the ones that do move will pay a big   price but when they hear this that I   movie it's very simple and in Cleveland   right now and throughout Ohio you have   companies negotiating to move some of   you work in those companies and many of   the people that work of those companies   are here now and you don't even know the   owners and the leaders of the company   are negotiating but with me you don't   have to worry about it because we will   make it economically very difficult for   them to leave the United States Philippa   oh so you don't have to worry if I win   day one we're going to announce our   plans to totally renegotiate the worst   trade deal ever made NAFTA   if we don't get what we wanted that   renegotiation we will leave NAFTA and   start over and get ultimately a much   much better trade deal we will also stop   the trans-pacific partnership the deal   Hillary Clinton lied about during the   debate when she called it the gold   standard and during the debate   never said that she lied she lied and   she lied about the line in the sand   remember she said no I never said that I   wasn't Secretary of State when Obama   made that stupid pledge lying in the   sand that he didn't honor just like some   people didn't honor the pledge to Donald   Trump when we all ran for the Republican   nomination there were a few people that   did not honor the pledge I would have   honored my pledge but some people are so   badly they'll never forget it so I guess   they couldn't handle it we are going to   start making things again in America we   are going to have apple and many   companies like Apple start making their   iPhones and their products in the United   States not in Vietnam and China and   every place but here   as part of our plan to bring back our   jobs we're going to lower our business   tax from thirty five percent to fifteen   percent right now with the highest in   the world we're going to be one of the   lowest our businesses are being for   south we can't let it happen wages will   rise jobs will return and factories will   come rushing onto our show we're also   going to fix our inner cities and help   African American and Hispanic Americans   who are being treated very very unfairly   forty five percent of african-american   youth live in poverty fifty-eight   percent of african-american youth don't   have jobs more than 3,000 people have   been shot in Chicago since January first   a very short period of times like a war   zone to those African Americans   suffering in our country we're in the   inner cities you have no jobs horrible   education and you oftentimes get shot   just walking down the street to buy a   loaf of bread I say this what the hell   do you have to lose vote for Donald   Trump I will fix it I   we'll fix   they've been run by these Democrats like   Hilary fur over a hundred years in some   cases unbroken I will fight harder for   you than anyone has ever fought before   nobody will fight like I'm going to   fight for you but I'm also going to   fight

umSgoyjoviE~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160907~FULL: Donald Trump Speaks on Military, Veterans in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (9/7/2016~18323.0~4.81583786011~518.0~25.0~   [Applause]   thanks everybody thank you very much   thank you very much it's a real honor to   be here   it's tough with the lights but I'm   looking over here I see some see some   friendly faces here a couple of things   first of all I'm going to go through   some just some comments here about some   of the things that are going on and then   and then introduced Donald Trump first   thing I want to do is I want to thank   the Union League of Philadelphia for   sponsoring this hosting this event this   is a super-important yeah give   yourselves a round of applause here so   it's an absolutely beautiful beautiful   facility here and and I know that this   organization doesn't awful lot for our   country across the country one of the   things I do want to I do want to   highlight here and we had this   announcement yesterday of these 88   generals and admirals that came out we   have a few in the audience today I will   tell you when that thing hit the street   we have had hundreds of others come   forward we wanted to time that thing   just like we did and I'd ask a couple   that are here today I know I see Gary   through the lights here I know that   there's a couple of others if you guys   could just stand up for taking a stand   so stand up for America thank you   [Applause]   yeah you know people know this I mean   what we are facing right now around the   world and this big speech today that   Donald's going to give is going to talk   about our military but we are facing one   of the most as it's been defined   described by many others many in our   government that this is one of the most   complex most dangerous times we've faced   in over 50 years and yet we are trying   to cut and downsize and just gouge our   military so you're gonna hear more about   that today you know one thing that I   that I always say when I when I do   introduce Donald Trump is the biggest   problem that he has is he tells the   truth I mean think about that you know   there's so many things so many issues   that he has raised that he's been so   spot-on about and sometimes it's the   harder truth that that really gets us to   wake up and I think it we need to wake   up in this country this is a critical   time for our country I mean there's so   many things at risk as we go forward   into the first half of this century   never mind trying to figure out where do   we want to be as a nation by the end of   this century and this is really what   we're talking about it's not so much for   the people that are sitting in this room   or or for me it's about our children and   our grandchildren especially our   grandchildren so today you're going to   hear about military readiness you're   going to hear about veterans I always   like to throw in our law enforcement   professionals as well although I know   Donald Trump talked a little bit about   our law enforcement professionals   yesterday won't talk too much about that   today but our law enforcement   professionals from the federal state   local tribal levels around this country   are part of our nation's security this   whole issue with exactly thank you thank   you   but and again when we talk about   military and our military readiness and   how we're monitor modernizing how we're   spending our money the size the scale   the scope everything that we are   involved in these days in this justjust   you know 15 years of perpetual conflict   that just seems like it is never going   to end and I think you're going to hear   some some very different things today in   in how Donald Trump will approach not   only our military readiness but how he   will approach the world stage again the   most complex and the most dangerous we   have faced in at least half a century if   not longer you know in warfare when you   when you have an uncertain situation to   your front one of the things you have to   do is you build up a reserve to be able   to deal with any surprises that come   your way and yet we have this uncertain   situation globally and we're cutting our   reserve we're cutting the forces that   actually you know are there to protect   us and we cannot have that any longer   again there's so many other things at   stake one of the other points that I   want to bring out about Donald Trump   today and it's a word that that he has   been tagged with I think by Hillary   Clinton and that's this issue of   temperament and I will tell you we   actually addressed it in the in the   letter that came out yesterday they   haven't seen that letter please take a   read through it you know   the funny thing about I think I actually   have known Donald Trump for some time   now and I've dealt with him one-on-one   I've dealt with him one on many I've   seen him interact you know I look at an   individual who has an amazing family   he's got an amazing global business and   the I would say that if I was going to   tag him with a strength it is the   strength of his temperament his   temperament is about winning it's about   winning and I think if we question   anybody's temperament we should question   Hillary Clinton's temperament I mean oh   my god Zach Lee exactly   and this and I know that this issues   gonna come up because you know they sit   there in you know in some some office   some campaign headquarters and they're   going let's pick the right word let's   make sure we try to stick it on hey give   him that label he has a temperament that   says we need to win we need to win at   the things that we are so desperately   you know in net in need of today I mean   everything from the Supreme Court of the   United States of America most people   don't know that right now we have five   Supreme Court justices between the ages   of 68 and 82 so the potential the   potential and normally a Supreme Court   justice either dies or departs office by   about the age of 75 so there's a   potential to the next president the   United States at least in the first four   years could change maybe three maybe   four potentially five potentially five   Supreme Court justices so so that you   know with all the other challenges all   the other kinds of things that we're   facing today and not to mention what's   happening with China I think everybody   just saw what happened with our   president over in China they just   totally disrespected him I mean it's   unbelievable to me   North Korea you'll hear about some of   these things today what is happening on   the sort of the eastern frontiers of of   Europe with Russia what Russia's doing   inside of the Middle East and frankly   you know again you'll hear some   different things coming out of Donald   Trump today but this is a guy that I've   known long enough and looked them you   know look them in the eyes and felt his   seriousness and passion for this country   as many of us in this room have and this   is a very very important time so I think   that what we need to all be doing is we   really need to reflect between now and   November 8th on how we want this country   to be going forward this is not about   you know well I wish that we had this   era or that era   this is about where do we stand today   where do we stand globally where do we   stand right here in the homeland and   where do we want to be going forward   well beyond four years it could be for   the next forty or for the next 400 years   so when you point it you listen to the   words that Donald Trump is going to talk   about today I want you to reflect on   this word that he's been labeled   which is temperament his temperament is   solid it's steady   he's very she's an unbelievable listener   he's somebody who takes in all of the   advice that he's been given and you've   seen you've seen the the great set   series of messages that he has been   providing for us for about the last   month if not the last year so this is   about winning this election is about   winning it is about putting the United   States of America back on a winning   track so with that ladies and gentlemen   I am humbly and honored to be standing   up here today to introduce to you the   next president of the United States of   America Donald J Trump   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   thank you everybody thank you very much   it's great honor today I'm here to talk   to you about three crucial words that   should be at the center always of our   foreign policy peace through strength   we want to achieve a stable peaceful   world with less conflict and more common   ground I am proposing a new foreign   policy focused on advancing America's   core national interests so important   promoting regional stability and   producing and easing the tensions within   our very troubled world   this will require rethinking the failed   policies of the past we can make new   friends rebuild old alliances and bring   new allies into the fold and we can do   that I'm proud to have the support of   warfighting generals active duty   military and top experts who know both   how to win and how to avoid endless wars   that were caught up in like the one we   have right now that just never ever ends   our longest war just yesterday   88 top generals and admirals endorsed my   campaign and these people are fantastic   thank you in a trump administration our   actions in the Middle East will be   tempered by realism the current strategy   of toppling regimes with no plan for   what to do the day after only produces   power vacuums that are filled simply by   terrorists gradual reform not sudden and   radical change should be our guiding   objective in that region we should work   with any country that shares our goal of   destroying Isis and defeating radical   Islamic terrorism   and we're going to form new friendships   and partnerships based on this mission   and this mission alone we now have an   administration and a former Secretary of   State who refused to say radical Islamic   terrorism and unless you're going to say   the words you're never going to solve   the problems very simple   immediately after taking office I will   ask my generals to present to me a plan   within 30 days to defeat and destroy   Isis   this will require a military warfare but   also cyber warfare financial warfare and   ideological warfare as I laid out in my   speech on defeating radical Islamic   terrorism   several weeks ago instead of an apology   tour which you saw President Obama give   over and over again   I will probably promote our system of   government and our way of life as the   best in the world just like we did in   our campaign against communism during   the Cold War   we will show the whole world how proud   we are to be Americans   at the same time immigration security is   a vital part of our national security we   only want to admit people to our country   who will support our values and love our   people they have to love our people   these are in fact the pillars of a sound   national security strategy unlike my   opponent my foreign policy will   emphasize diplomacy not destruction   Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq Libya   Syria has produced only turmoil and   suffering and death her destructive   policies have displaced millions of   people then she has invited these   refugees into the West with no plan to   screen them including veteran health   care costs and this was just announced   and read over the last number of weeks   the price of the wars in Iraq and   Afghanistan will total approximately six   trillion dollars we could have rebuilt   our country over and over again yet   after all this money was spent and lives   lost Clinton's policies as Secretary of   State have left the Middle East in more   disarray than ever before   not even close had we done nothing we   would have been in far better position   meanwhile China has grown more   aggressive and North Korea more   dangerous and belligerent than ever   Russia has defied this administration at   every single turn   Putin has no respect for President Obama   and has absolutely no respect for   Hillary Clinton sometimes it seemed like   there wasn't a country in the Middle   East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to   invade intervene in or topple she's   trigger-happy and very unstable whether   we like it or not that's what's going on   she's also reckless so reckless in fact   that she put her emails when an illegal   surfer that our enemies could easily   hack and probably have then Clinton's   team used a technology called bleach pit   which is basically acid and this is   going to acid wash her emails who would   do this and nobody does it because of   the expense who would do this they even   took a hammer to some of her 13 phones   to cover up her tracks in obstruction of   justice these email records were   destroyed after she received a subpoena   remember that word after after she   received a subpoena from Congress to   turn them over if you do that private   enterprise it's a violation of the law   she did this after receiving a subpoena   from the United States Congress in the   FBI report she claims she couldn't   recall important information on 39   separate and different occasions she   can't even remember whether she has   trained in the use of classified   information and she said she didn't know   the letter C means confidential or at   least classified if she can't remember   such crucial events and information   honestly she's totally unfit to be our   commander-in-chief totally unfair   but I have a feeling she did remember   and she does know and that also makes   her unfit her conduct is simply   disqualifying she talks about her   experience but Hillary Clinton's only   foreign policy experience ended up in   absolute failure everywhere she got   involved things got worse let's look   back at the Middle East at the very   beginning of 2009 before Hillary Clinton   was sworn in Libya was there Syria was   under control   Egypt was ruled by a secular president   and an ally of the United States Iraq   was experiencing a reduction in violence   the group that would become what is now   called Isis was close to being   extinguished would have never happened   would have never happened   Iran was being choked off by economic   sanctions fast forward to today what   have we gotten from the horrible   horrible decisions made by Barack Obama   and Secretary Clinton Libya is in ruins   our ambassador and three other brave   Americans are dead and Isis has gained a   new base of operations and taking their   very valuable oil Syria is in the midst   of a disastrous civil war Isis controls   large portions of territory a refugee   crisis now threatens Europe and the   United States and hundreds of thousands   of people are dead in Egypt terrorists   have gained a foothold in the Sinai   desert near the Suez Canal one of the   most essential waterways any   in the world Iraq is in chaos and Isis   is on the loose and Iran by the way will   be taking over Iraq and their vast oil   reserves Isis has spread across the   Middle East and into the West Iran the   world's largest state sponsor of   terrorism is now flush with 150 billion   dollars in cash being released and   released by the United States plus   another 1.7 billion that we just learned   about last evening in cash and some   payments we thought it was 400 million   turns out that it's now 1.7 billion   dollars in cash in other words our   country was blackmailed and extorted   into paying this unheard-of amount of   money as ransom and our president lied   to us   worst of all the nuclear deal puts Iran   the number one state sponsor of radical   Islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear   weapons and that path will go very   quickly this is Hillary Clinton's   foreign policy legacy failure and death   but that's not all President Obama and   Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep   cuts in our military which only invite   more aggression really we will have   aggression like you've never seen before   and you've got it already happening our   our adversaries are chomping at the bit   history shows that what America is not   prepared is when the danger is by far   the greatest we want to deter avoid and   prevent conflict through our   unquestioned military strength we have   the greatest people in the world we have   to give them the great   under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton   defense spending is on track to fall to   its lowest level as a share of the   economy since the end of World War two   we currently have the smallest army   since 1940 the Navy is among the   smallest it has been since 1915 some   hundred years ago and the Air Force is   the smallest it's been since 1947 when I   don't Reagan left office our Navy had   592 ships when Barack Obama took office   it had 285 ships today the Navy has just   276 ships the average Air Force aircraft   is 27 years old we have second   generation b-52 bombers their fathers   flew the same plane as they're flying   right now   this is not the United States our army   has been shrinking rapidly from 550   3,000 soldiers to in 2009 to just 479   thousand soldiers today some decrease   and they want to make it smaller in 2009   our marine corps had two hundred and two   thousand active marines today it's a   hundred eighty two thousand our ship   count is below the minimum of 308 that   the Navy says is needed to execute its   current Michigan's at a minimal level   President Obama plans to reduce the army   to 450,000 troops which would hamstring   our ability to defend the United States   it takes 22 years on average to field a   major new weapon system in 2010 the   United States spent five hundred and   fifty four billion dollars on non-war   base defense spending in the year   and I have to say currently we're   spending 548 billion dollars a cut of   10% and that number is going down very   rapidly looking into the future unless I   become your president   this reduction was done through what is   known as sequester but you've all heard   about or automatic defense budget cuts   under the budget agreement defense took   half of the cuts even though it makes up   only one-sixth of the budget so they put   it all in defense as soon as I take   office I will ask Congress to fully   eliminate the defense sequester and will   submit a new budget to rebuild our   military it is so depleted we will   rebuild   this will increase certainty in the   defense community as to funding and will   allow military leaders to plan for our   future defense needs and most   importantly we will be defended   because without defense we don't have a   country   as part of removing the defense   sequester I will ask Congress to fully   offset the costs of increased military   spending in the process we will make   government leaner and more responsive to   the public   I will ask that savings be accomplished   through common-sense reforms that   eliminate government waste and budget   gimmicks and that protect absolutely   protect hard-earned benefits for   Americans government-wide improper   government payments are estimated to   exceed 135 billion dollars per year and   the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated   to be as high as 385 billion dollars a   year we can also reduce the size of the   federal bureaucracy through responsible   workforce attrition that is that is when   employees retire they can be replaced by   a smaller number of new employees that's   the best way to do it we can also stop   funding programs that are not authorized   in law Congress spent 320 billion   dollars last year on 256 expired laws   these are laws that are done spend all   of that money removing just 5% of that   will reduce spending by almost two   hundred billion dollars over a 10-year   period the military will not be exempt   either the military bureaucracy will   have to be trimmed down we have to   create that strength and sometimes we   have to reduce bureaucracy   it just gets in our way   early in my term I will also be   requesting that all NATO nations   promptly pay their bills which many are   not now cool   only five NATO countries including the   United States are currently meeting   their minimum requirement to spend 2% of   GDP on defense they understand it they   know they have to do they can afford to   do it they have no respect for our   leadership they have no respect for our   country they will do it they'll be happy   to do it they will be happy to know it   additionally I will be respectfully   asking countries such as Germany Japan   South Korea Saudi Arabia to pay more for   the tremendous security we provide them   and they're fully understand their   economic behemoths they're tremendously   successful countries but we're   subsidizing them for billions and   billions of dollars   I think they'll fully understand finally   we will have at our disposal additional   revenues from unleashing American energy   the Institute for energy research cites   a short-run figure of as much as thirty   six billion dollars annually from   increased energy production tremendous   amounts of   tremendous numbers of jobs and   tremendous amounts of money and your   electric bills will go down there's   something nice about using these new   funds I will ask my Secretary of Defense   to propose a new defense budget to meet   the following long term goals we will   build an active army of around five   hundred and forty thousand as the Army's   chief of staff has said he needs   desperately and really must have to   protect our country we now we now have   only 31 brigade combat teams or four   hundred and ninety thousand troops and   only one-third of combat teams are   considered combat ready that's not good   for our country I actually don't even   like saying it because plenty of   countries are watching us right now but   we'll get it shaped up very quickly   [Music]   we will build a marine core based on 36   battalions which the Heritage Foundation   notes is the minimum needed to deal with   major contingencies right now we only   have 23 we will build a navy of 350   surface ships and submarines as   recommended by the bipartisan national   defense panel we right now only have 276   ships and it's not enough and we will   build an Air Force of at least 1200   fighter aircraft which the Heritage   Foundation again has shown to be needed   to execute current missions we now have   1113 not enough we will also seek to   develop a state-of-the-art missile   defense system   under Obama Clinton our ballistic   missile defense capability has been   degraded at the very moment in the   United States history and it's Alice we   are facing the strongest most heightened   missile threat that we have ever ever   had you look at Iran you look at North   Korea you look at terrorists we don't   even know where to look we don't know   where to look but believe me you can   look all over so we are going to do that   we need a form of shield we want to   protect our country   as these potential adversaries grow   their missile missile programs US   military facilities in Asia and the   Middle East as well as our allies are   increasingly in range with the United   States homeland and we are really   absolutely and potentially being   threatened and within two years we will   absolutely have a real threat they'll be   able to reach us so easily the way it's   going right now we propose to rebuild   the key tools of missile defense   starting with Navy cruisers that are the   foundation of our missile defense   capabilities in Europe Asia and the   Middle East the Obama Clinton   administration tried repeatedly to   remove our cruisers from service then   refused to modernize these very old   aging aging ships they're old they're   tired we will start by modernizing our   cruisers to provide the ballistic   missile defense capability our nation   needs this will cost around 220 million   dollars per modernization as we seek to   modernize a significant portion of these   22 ships it will also mean jobs for our   country paint jobs   and that is one of the big benefits it's   called jobs for our country which we   desperately need as we expand our Navy   toward the goal of 350 ships   we will also procure additional modern   destroyers that are designed to handle   the missile defense mission in the   coming years accomplishing this missile   rebuild and our military retooling will   be a 50-state effort every state in the   Union will be able to take part in   rebuilding our military and developing   technologies of tomorrow in other words   the workers and the jobs will take place   throughout the United States   in addition we will improve the   Department of Defense's cyber   capabilities a new threat a new problem   very expensive and we're not doing very   well with cyber Hillary Clinton has   taught us really how vulnerable we are   in cyber hacking that's probably the   only thing that we've learned from   Hillary Clinton   which is why one of the first things we   must do is to enforce all classification   rules and to enforce all laws relating   to the handling of classified   information Hillary Clinton put her   emails on a secret server nobody knew   about except for the man that was given   the fifth remember whatever happened to   him where is it   what happened to him where did he go he   pled the fifth never that's the end of   him   she put her emails on a secret server to   cover up her pay-for-play scandals in   the State Department   nothing threatens the integrity of our   democracy more than when government   officials put their public office up for   sale we will also we will also make it a   priority to develop defensive and   offensive cyber capabilities at our US   Cyber Command and recruit the best and   brightest Americans one of my first   directives   after taking office will be asking the   Joint Chiefs of Staff and all relevant   federal departments to conduct a federal   review of United States cyber defenses   and identify all vulnerabilities and we   have to do that immediately including to   our power grid our communication system   and all vital infrastructure   I will then ask for a plan to   immediately protect those   vulnerabilities and then fix them at the   same time at the same time we will   invest heavily in offensive cyber   capabilities to disrupt our enemies   including terrorists to rely heavily on   Internet communications Isis is using   the Internet to recruit Isis is using   the internet to intercept and do all   sorts of things to our country we have   to be many steps ahead of them and we   will be   these new investments in cybersecurity   and the modernization of our military   will spur substantial new job creation   in the private sector and help create   the jobs and technologies of tomorrow   it's what we have to do America must be   the world's dominant technological   powerhouse of the 21st century and young   Americans including in our inner cities   should get these new jobs through   training through education it will   happen   we must also ensure that we have the   best medical care education and support   for our military service members and   their families both when they serve and   when they return to civilian life   our veterans are not being treated well   our veterans in many cases are being   treated worse than illegal immigrants   people that come into our country   illegally our veterans are not being   treated well and by the way Hillary   Clinton has been doing this for 35 years   now she says she can do it she doesn't   have a clue doesn't have a rule   our debt to our men and women in uniform   is eternal always will be to all of   those who have served this nation I say   so strongly that I will never ever let   you down   we will protect those who protect us   it's very simple we will protect those   who protect us and we will follow their   example of unity we will work across all   racial and income lines to create one   American nation together we will have   one great American future our potential   is unlimited we will be one people under   one God saluting one American flag   [Applause]   and by the way we love our flag America   will be a prosperous generous and   inclusive society we will discard the   failed policies and division of the past   and embrace true American change to   rebuild our economy rebuild our inner   cities they need help so desperately and   rebuild our country we will bring back   our jobs and we will not let our jobs go   to other countries   we will make America strong again   we will make America safe again and we   will make America great again greater   than ever before thank you very much and   God bless you thank you   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]
Uzs-la2eyr8~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161104~FULL EVENT: Donald Trump Rally in Wilmington, Ohio (11/4/2016) Trump Live Wilmington Ohio Speech~58667.0~4.766913414~1907.0~118.0~   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   hey   [Music]   yes   [Music]   [Music]   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Applause]   have you been seeing what's happening   with those poles that like rocket ships   I'll tell you it's been great i love   ohio   I did well in Ohio gave me confidence to   go out with life but right at the   beginning I was in a while so we're   loving thank you everyone for coming   influence we are going to win the great   state of Ohio   of the one house   new polls just out have us with a very   substantial lead in Ohio nationwide   we're looking great in Florida we're   looking great at North Carolina we are   looking great in the state of   Pennsylvania we just left your Hampshire   we have a lead in New Hampshire he's   very dishonest people back to the media   to get it   you can vote early personally you can   show a November rain who is voted   great but you shaving right thank you   wanna be tradition   real change begins with immediately   repealing and replacing horrible   Obamacare that the residents of Ohio are   going to experience massive massive   problems with their Obamacare you know   about that I guess right you know about   it's a serious problem it is a serious   problem and you can have numbers in the   great state of Arizona it's gone up 116   percent okay 116 percent so you're gonna   have a lot of problems we're going to   work on it very hard 88 counties in Ohio   are losing at least 3 Obamacare ensures   a year okay so next year you're going to   have almost almost nobody even to   negotiate with by next year but it's not   gonna matter because if we win the   election you're not gonna have Obamacare   do   [Applause]   nothing to worry about the limit and we   are going to have great health care at a   much lower price and it's going to be   something you're going to be very proud   of right now it's an international joke   Obamacare it's an international joke   dreams are surging companies are leaving   insurers are fleeing doctors are   quitting I know so many doctors they   quit and generally speaking deductibles   are going through the roof some higher   than others we have deductibles I've   heard as high as fifteen or sixteen   thousand dollars yet Hillary Clinton   wants to double down and Obamacare   making it even more expensive I'm asking   for your vote so we can replace   Obamacare and save health care for every   family in Ohio but more importantly   because we don't want to think of   ourselves for every family in the United   States   [Applause]   real change also means restoring honesty   to government so we want to start by   getting rid of Hillary Clinton   [Applause]   the FBI now has multiple open criminal   investigations going on Hillary Clinton   lots of bad things are happening lots of   really bad things are happening but I'll   tell you what you're going to be amazed   when it's all finished when you look at   how it's all flushing out the system is   a beautiful system when it works we have   a rigged system so many times you see   this I mean you have things going on   there incredible that includes a   discovery of another 650,000 emails and   also a criminal investigation into her   pay-for-play corruption at the State   Department last night was just confirmed   that the six hundred and fifty thousand   emails include brand new emails not   previously seen by authorities likely   including classified information   Hilary is now facing major problems with   perjury the FBI agents say their   investigation is likely to yield perhaps   an indictment the reports also show that   the political leadership at the   Department of Justice is trying as hard   as they can to protect the arranger   Hillier this is no agent they want to   protect their range   did we ever have a situation like this   is first of all forget about as of last   friday with the new 650,000 emails it   was bad forget that she should have been   disqualified for running for president   from the first   [Applause]   we take a look at the first batch why do   we even have to go now we're doing it   all look what we found how many times do   we have to do this I believe the FBI   wanted to do it and she was protected by   friends of hers at the Department of   Justice that's the department where as   you know the Attorney General was on the   airplane now they service for 45 minutes   talking about the grandchildren I'm   talking about God for 45 minutes I don't   think so   think we were talking about a position   in other words a continuation of a   position I think that's what they were   talking about folks Hilary has engaged   in a criminal massive enterprise and   cover-ups like probably nobody ever   before remember John Podesta said she   has bad instincts and you know she was   getting off the plane they would just   announcing new wiki leaks that i wanted   to stay there but I didn't want to keep   you waiting   [Applause]   I didn't want to go there was some   beauties coming out and I'm saying do I   listen for another hitter you can listen   for hours but think of it John Podesta   her top person said she has been   instincts for the hell Watsa a president   where the person that knows her best at   her instincts her bed now Bernie Sanders   such as bad judgment but at least he was   running against her right but the person   working with idea what I would fire   Podesta very quickly by work he should   be fired and honestly shouldn't Huma be   fired I mean can you imagine can you   imagine did you get rid of all the   emails yes ma'am they're all gone yes   ma'am this is gone up for months did you   get rid of the emails yes ma'am they're   gone we deleted 33,000 of them they're   all gone I think we're in the clear and   then they find out going through a   pervert pile   Anthony Weiner anybody in New York knows   all about Anthony way and i predicted it   a year ago did you hear me right and I   said all the things I said and they all   said what a horrible thing to say I   turned out to be right even some even   some of these very dishonest people in   the media said Trump real troll that one   I called a lot of them I called the   bottom but can you imagine whom i get   rid of they're all gone 33,000 didn't I   do a good job and then they find out oh   we got bad news boss hey I think they   went on the cloud you know the time   never disappears off the clap for those   people when they advertise the cloud   never disappears she said was we're bad   news they just found 650,000 emails can   you imagine and I'll tell you some of   those emails all i would get anything   some of those emails are so bad they're   so classified dibby on classical they   have emails there that are beyond   classified   it's all coming down because I've always   had a lot of confidence in the FBI to   give amazing people in the FBI and   they're not happy they're not happy   about life what's up and they're not   happy about the way they're being pushed   around and you don't push them around   for long believe me she created an   illegal email sir to shield her criminal   activity and corrupt pay for play and   then she illegally destroyed 33,000   emails after this is the big key after   that's the key word after receiving a   congressional subpoena so after so she   gets to subpoena and she says get rid of   it and that's fun and yet they put four   star general last week james Cartwright   highly respected current four-star   general they may put him in jail for up   to five years for doing nothing by   comparison General Petraeus have   suffered suffered horribly reputation   destroyed for doing nothing by   comparison they took the kid who wanted   some pictures of the submarine that's an   old submarine they got plenty of   pictures of the enemy wants if they've   got bloody up he wanted to take a couple   of pictures they put him in jail for a   year I saw his mother the other night   I'll tell you what folks we've never   been in a situation like this and then   she's allowed to run for president and   general Cartwright is put in jail for   doing peanuts and he said he did it and   he said he said that he lied for   national security purposes who knows but   he did nothing by comparison to what   she's done if she were to win it would   create an unprecedented constitutional   crisis she is likely to be under   investigation for a long time concluding   probably in a criminal trial we all want   to go through a process and we want to   make sure everyone is guilty properly   guilty properly everything has to be   perfect but she did things where and we   have one child have to go but what she's   guilty she's guilty just if you took the   emails and that's the least of what she   did she got rid of emails that's the   least of what she did   if she ever got into the Oval Office   Hilary and her corrupt friends would rob   this country blind my contract with the   American voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption   [Applause]   correction to establish to hear and heed   the words we all are about to say we all   you ready it amazing how this phrase is   called I didn't like it I thought it was   corny I thought it was really sort of   corny phrase I don't like it when we win   a november eight we're going to   Washington DC and we are going to drag   [Applause]   went to one now yet another and they're   all screaming drain the swamp but Frank   Sinatra didn't like by what he did like   till he sang it you it is when crazy   sang it again became number one over   suddenly loved it very much at the core   of my contract is my plan to bring back   our jobs   informants manufacturing jobs and staff   to deal signed by Bill Clinton and   supported by crooked Hillary Clinton   America's losses one of the hardest   things to believe because it doesn't   seem physically possible 70,000 factory   since China entered the World Trade   Organization another bill and hillary   backed disaster we're living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   the world it's true to single greatest   job step you take a look at what's   happened not only are you look at   upstate New York you look at   Pennsylvania look at North Carolina look   at South Carolina you look at what's   going to look at new england new england   boy they got in general motors laid off   1151 workers in moraine and move their   jobs to Mexico China and various other   countries   for easier laid off 356 workers in Troy   anybody from Troy good you still have   your job and move their jobs to Mexican   Delta Phi later 5805 what's with delphi   you know about that right 5805 workers   in dayton   boy oh boy that's a lot of jobs and move   their jobs to Mexico   we have a one-way highway going into   some of these countries especially   Mexico everything goes in I always say   they get the jobs the plants the money   we get the drugs we get the unemployment   so one way straight not going to happen   any more folks not gonna happen   there has to be consequences when that   happens they're going to be consequences   we're going to fight I don't worry but   we'll build the wall it's gonna be   [Applause]   and every time I see a Delphi and every   time I see these companies leaving that   wall gets a little bit higher we're   going to fight for workers and we're   going to fight the Delphi of these other   companies don't leave us and they're   going to be consequences because the   people got a raw deal and they deserve   so much better a trump administration   will stop the jobs from leaving Ohio or   from leaving America and will stop the   jobs I tell you wat like you've never   seen before it will happen quickly the   theft of American prosperity will end if   a company wants to fire their workers   leave Ohio move to another country build   their big beautiful fact ship their   products back into the United States we   will make them pay thirty-five percent   tax going through a very strong   is   [Applause]   and you know what's gonna happen they're   not get a little fucking late now the   politicians could do something about   this how long have we been ducted about   this 15 years he's gotten really bad   over the last five or six years really   bad it's gotten to be catastrophic   catastrophic but know this i mean some   dude something some are not exactly i   won't say some are too bright that mark   and some are getting tremendous amounts   of money from donors and from people   that want to see those companies leave   that reasons for the companies to leave   including ownership interests and those   companies the problem is the politicians   are working for those donors they're not   working for the American people they're   not working for all the people that got   fired what we're good job   so what's going to happen is they won't   leave her the ones who do leave that's   okay too because the country will make a   fortune because that's going to be   called the consequence we can stop it   dead and as we speak right now you have   leaders in your cup going out right now   as we're speaking you have leaders going   out trying to negotiate deals to leave   Ohio in other places go to Mexico got   other countries but don't worry about   because if I get elected MP very little   negotiation a drop the package French   will renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't   get the deal we want we will terminate   NAFTA and get a much better deal for our   workers i want free trade   what's free trip to keep going to three   track well I want featuring two but i   really want fair trade fair to this   country and for our workers that's   what's going to be will get up there   fair trade   we will also immediately stop the   job-killing trans-pacific partnership   from happening that's going to be your   next visit that's another NAFTA   potential as part of our plan to bring   back jobs we're going to lower taxes on   American business from thirty-five   percent 250 we will simply cut taxes for   the middle class we will also unleash   American energy including jail oil   natural gas and clean coal we're going   to put our miners back to work we're   going to put our steel workers back to   work   we will cancel big masters of global   warming payments to the United Nations   [Applause]   by the way nobody even knows what   happens to that money I could that's a   pretty good idea but nobody even knows   what happens and we will use that money   to invest in that includes proj is like   improving Interstate 71 card is anybody   like that I got like a lot of them save   the money you know we owe 20 trillion   okay do you like the idea of improving   the interstate I mean it's not exactly   you're not thrilled by it let's not do   with that with it let's save the mother   and replace it the Brent Spence

police   officers are up forty five percent just   now just a couple of hours ago to New   York City police offers supposed to be   too great people were shot in the Bronx   badly badly shot   we send our thoughts and prayers to the   officers and their families just   happened moments before I left the plane   [Applause]   unbelievable a trump administration will   protect those who protect us and we will   stop this tremendous surge in grunt   we will also keep America safe from   terrorism Hillary Clinton wants a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees flowing into our country   that's above the thousands that are   coming in now under the Obama plan five   hundred and fifty percent above the   thousands already coming in her plan   will import generations of terrorism   extremism and radicalism and it's   something we can't allow to happen   they'll be in our schools they'll be in   our communities and honestly we want to   take care of people and we have to and   will help them we'll build safe havens   will get the Gulf states who have   nothing but money and they haven't done   their job they will pay for it we're not   paying for it we have 20 trillion we're   not paying for it when I'm elected   president so we will take care of it we   want everybody here wants to take care   of it but we don't want to end up like   France you see what's happening in Paris   and nice you see what's happening in   Germany the problems we have enough   problems in our country we will suspend   the Syrian refugee program and we will   keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell   out of our country   [Applause]   and we have a president by the way all   he does his campaign shouldn't he be   back like trying to get jobs and working   on Isis and maybe not giving a four   month notice that we're going into Mosul   to attack them you saw that whole   situation we will be attacking Mosul in   four months I say why don't don't tell   me I don't want to hear that because we   are going to capture the leaders of Isis   by attacking mausam you see what's going   on right I'd say it all the time and   every military leader general Flynn   who's great general Kellogg they're all   saying you're so right so we have a   president frankly doesn't know what the   hell he's doing he doesn't know what   look at what's happening with so many   things whether it's jobs but why is he   spending all of his time campaigning for   somebody under federal investigation all   he does is campaign and campaign he   ought to be back in the Oval Office he   ought to be back there working you ought   to be back there working   I have a lot of good suggestions up here   okay so we're gonna make our country   strong again we're going to build up our   military which is so badly depleted so   badly depleted you know these are the   greatest people there are and we have   old equipment we have old fighter jets   we have all planes and guns and   everything the enemy has newer and   better equipment than we do in many   cases recently they had a documentary on   the Jets they're 18 19 years old you saw   it look a lot of people solve it where   they can't replace the parts they can't   replace the parts they have to go to   plane graveyards and plain museums   because they don't make the parts   anymore so all of these things are   happening we are going to have a   top-notch modern military we don't have   a choice we don't have a choice   [Applause]   we are going to do something else how   many vets are in the audience wow that's   a lot of vets we are going to take care   of our vets and we're going to take care   of them properly we have illegal   immigrants coming into the country that   are taking better care of then our vets   and that's not going to happen that's   not going to happen our vets are waiting   on line for five days six days seven   days 10 days to see a doctor for a   simple procedure or a simple   prescription not going to happen anymore   not going to happen you know that and   this is a number two numbers are the   hardest to believe that we lost seventy   seven thousand factories that i told you   about 77 I thought they meant 700   factories or 7,000 77,000 the other one   is that we have a suicide rate 22 vets a   day it's in I said that can't be right   you mean 22 a year no 22 a day and a lot   of that is because of the horrible   horrible situation that's taking place   run by the Veterans Administration and   this has gone on for years and Hillary's   Hillary Clinton said it's fine it's just   fine the way it is and you know that she   said it's just fine the way it is and   that's the thing during the debate she   was very interesting and I did win the   debates in all fairness you   did you see where she said all the time   I'm in debate prep Hillary Clinton is   debating I mean she's in the background   she is in debate prep she was in there   for weeks you know what it was it was   really an excuse for her to go to sleep   and Rex she was in debate prep and I   kept hearing I felt guilty she'd sort   like a week and a half before and she   was in debate prep she wasn't at the   background and the truth is if you don't   know the subject so well that you have   to prep for two weeks you're the wrong   person anyway but it was really an   excuse for her to sleep and to rest okay   but we did well so we did win the   debates read every poem every single   Paul said we won the debates but I I   learned something in the debates because   she's saying we will fight Isis we will   do this we will do that we don't like   what you did with taxes startled trunk I   said well that's okay why didn't you   change the tax cut by the way all of her   friends do the same thing torrent but   why don't you change the tax code you   were there you were senator Secretary of   State you're with I mean you were the   wife of the president she doesn't like   it you know so I'd watch she's like a   critic she complains but she'll never do   anything about it she said we'll get rid   of Isis well there was no Isis when she   became Secretary of State ice is formed   during her tenure right it came out of   the vacuum because the way they got out   of Iraq was unbelievable he's stupid and   ice is formed now they're in 32   countries she has zero chance of getting   rid of Isis I have one hundred percent   chance okay i have 100   we have no choices is like we're living   in medieval times this is it like it's   war and people get shot and people get   killed and it's horrible this is   people's heads are chopped off by the   hundreds by the thousands and if you're   Christian you have no chance and it's   very hard you know if you're in Syria   I've heard this for years it's amazing   even before the migration if you're a   Christian it was almost impossible to   come into the United States almost   impossible and yet these people were   under this horrible horrible rule and   they were being decimated and killed and   by the way the evangelicals Christians   Jews Catholics I have such tremendous   support it's unbelievable some believe   it's unbelievable so we're going to do   things that are going to make you very   proud and we're going to be strong again   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and as I said when these young   attractive people started screaming they   want the wall we will build a wall that   will make you so happy to that group   over there   a lot of uthia we're going to build a   great wall and Mexico's gonna pay for   the wall and the reason we're gonna have   a great relationship with Mexico the   mexican president short while ago very   nice with a great meeting but mexico is   beating us at the border they're killing   us entre we have a trade deficit with   mexico that nobody would believe it's a   fraction of what we're talking about   with respect to the cost of the world   because a lot of politicians ask me the   question how are you going to get Mexico   to pay I said when you see their trade   deficit billions and billions of dollars   and you look at the cost of the wall   then you'll understand how easy it's   going to be so we're going to build a   wall it'll be a great wall Mexico's   gonna pay for the wall we're going to   stop those drugs from pouring in and   poisoning are you we're gonna stop and   it will be a great well maybe someday   they'll name it after Trump who the hell   knows I really don't know if I want a   wall but that's we received the   first-ever endorsement from our ice and   Border Patrol officers   it's just been reported that as a result   of our open borders violent   transnational cartels have spread into   all 50 of our state's you've read that   more than ninety percent of those   arrests are here illegally so ninety   percent of the people that are here   doing the things that you and I know   they're doing are in our country   illegally they're killing innocent   Americans and others threatening schools   and totally destroying communities a   government that will not protect its   people is a government unworthy to lead   unworthy to leave I mean think of it   think of it with respect to radical   Islam where you have a president that   won't mention the words and you have a   candidate that won't say radical Islamic   terrorism how do you solve a problem if   you refuse to acknowledge Hillary will   never protect your family which is why   she can never lead this country but   that's only one reason why the other   reason why is that she is guilty of so   many crimes   and that's why it's a rigged system   because she should not be allowed to run   and when you look at what's going on   with her protection you'll understand   exactly what I'm saying when I say   rigged system you could ask Bernie   Sanders about a rigged system the   mistake he made what he endorsed Hillary   Clinton he made a deal with the devil   and his stock went way down and we're   going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders   people supporting us because he was   right about one thing he was right about   the borders and trade and you know what   I'm much tougher on trade that he was   ever ever a lot of his people are coming   over should have never made a deal he   would have gone down is a great person   in political history had he not made   that deal and now he just goes out and   speaks before small crowds and then you   see WikiLeaks all the bad things they   say about him that alone should stop   that alone should stop it and just like   I said that's why Hillary should fire   Podesta how do you have people working   that say these horrible things about you   where I love reading those WikiLeaks the   immigration office is warned in their   letter when they endorsed me that   Hillary's plan is the most radical   immigration proposal in united states   history it will lead to the loss of   thousands and thousands of lives and   they know what they're talking about   folks as Secretary of State Hillary   Clinton allowed many many many people   the most dangerous and violent criminal   aliens to go free because their home   countries refuse to take them back now I   don't blame their home countries but   when we catch drug lords killers gang   members and we bring them back into   their home country I give you my word   there won't be one instance where that   country doesn't take those people   and we are going to have a plan because   they keep coming back and back and back   and back because we're weak and were   ineffective when they come back five   years in jail when they come back again   more than five years in jail and when   they come back a third time much longer   than that let me tell you folks that   never coming back it's a very simple   solution than never coming back they'd   come back 12 x 13 times they look at us   they laugh Hillary supports totally open   borders there goes your country and   strongly support sanctuary cities like   San Francisco where Kate Steinle was   murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported at least five times here in   Ohio 60 year old Margaret Castle dick   was murdered in cold blood by an illegal   immigrant last July in nearby concord   township earlier that day her illegal   immigrant killer attempted to rape a   fourteen-year-old girl and shot another   woman while she was with her children in   the Park Police encountered the illegal   immigrant more than three weeks before   the crime spree but federal authorities   refused to take him in just refused to   take him into custody he was set free   and then he went out and killed Margaret   and people that knew him by the way were   begging begging that he'd be   incarcerated but our weak immigration   policies are responsible for many many   deaths many deaths a trump   administration will end this nightmare   of violence we will protect American   lives we will cancel all federal funding   to sanctuary cities we will stop illegal   immigration deport all criminal aliens   and dismantle every last criminal cartel   and it will happen within the first week   of my presidency   [Applause]   when we win you will finally have a   government on your side fighting for   your community and protecting your   family we will also repeal the   obama-clinton defense sequester and   rebuild our so badly depleted military   we will build new advanced aircraft at   places like wright-patterson Air Force   Base you like that place I like it for   I'm honored to have the endorsement of   more than 200 top Admirals and generals   and more than 22 medal of honor   recipients they were with me last night   we're in Fort Bragg that was an amazing   evening we had 21,000 people last night   most incredible brave people you've ever   seen Hillary brought death and disaster   to Iraq Syria Libya she empowered Iran   and she Unleashed Isis across the world   that's what she did through and   competence through gross incompetency   and Obama Unleashed Isis now she wants   to start a shooting horn Syrian conflict   with a nuclear-armed Russia that could   easily lead to World War three she's an   unstable person folks I know my people   she's an unstable person I mean look at   the way she handled this email mess do   you want that handling our country   Hilary and our failed establishment have   spent listen to this one this is the new   number six trillion dollars on wars in   the Middle East that we never win that   go on forever never win them I wonder   what General MacArthur would say I   wonder what General George Patton is   spinning he's going to spin they're   spinning in their graves they made us   less safe they've shipped our jobs and   our wealth to other countries and   they've left our borders wide open at   home we send troops to fight and die and   defend our borders but we don't care   about our borders we're more interested   defending the borders of countries that   a lot of people have never even heard of   some believable think of it we fight to   defend a border and someplace far away   but we don't even have borders in our   country that will change in november   eight   and by the way two things I want people   to come into our country we're going to   have Aegis 7 a big and beautiful door   we're going to have the big beautiful   doors but they're going to come into our   country legally legally they're coming   into our country legally and the process   is going to be speeded up and it's going   to be brought into a modern age it's now   archaic people in line for 10 and 12   years but people are going to come in we   want people to come into our country but   they're going to come in through a   process they're going to come in Legally   a trump administration will never ever   put the interests of a foreign country   before the interests of our country   I'm not running to be President of the   world to believe me I'm running to be   president of our great United States of   America   and from the day I take office it will   be always America first to all Americans   I say it's time for change in it's time   for new leadership can you imagine four   years of Hillary Clinton now I mean   seriously forget about running forget   about the race can you imagine four more   years of Isis four more years of high   taxes four more years of nothing but   problems in addition to all of the   legalities that she's done ayeeee ayeeee   I don't even like to think about it just   think about in closing what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trump administration we are going to   have the biggest tax cut since Ronald   Reagan she is raising taxes very   seriously you saw her tax increase its   massive you know we have the highest tax   nation in the world and she wants to   raise taxes we're going to eliminate so   many different things but our taxes are   going way down and we're going to get   rid of all unnecessary job-killing   regulations we're going to cancel every   illegal Obama executive order we will   protect religious liberty   rebuild our military and we are going to   take great care as I said of our   veterans provide school choice and put   an end to common core we're bringing   education local we will support the   great men and women of law enforcement   we're going to save our Second Amendment   which is under siege and appoint   justices to the Supreme Court who will   hold you know this look this is one of   the most serious things Justice Scalia   died very unexpectedly we have one the   next president could appoint as many as   34 I mean there's even a scenario it   could be five if we don't get this right   we will not have a country many people   think it's like the most important thing   so we're going to appoint justices to   the United States Supreme Court who will   uphold and defend the Constitution of   the United States so important   for all those people that don't even   mention that it's one of the really   important elements of what we're doing   and one of the very most important   things that we're going to be doing it   is time to cut our ties with the fail   politicians of the past Hillary Clinton   is a candidate of yesterday we are the   movement of the future we are fighting   for every citizen who believes that   government should serve the people not   the donors and not the special entry we   are fighting to save everything honestly   we're fighting to save everything we're   not just looking at having a strong   military and having that we're fighting   to save everything our country is a   total mess you just take a look you just   take a look we're also fighting to get   rid of sanctuary cities we're fighting   to get rid of sanctuary cities we're   fighting to save the next worker from   being laid off when their job is ship   unexpectedly to another country we're   fighting to save our government from   crime corruption you look at what's   happening our government's being eaten   alive cronyism and kick the crooks out   of Washington DC don't let the pundits   the politicians of the media tell you   what kind of a country you have don't   let them limit your dreams because they   want to limit your dreams you can have   any future you want all we have to do is   stop believing in our failed politicians   and start believing in America again   I'm asking you to reject the cynics and   to dream big because with your vote we   are just four days can you believe it   four days this started on june sixteenth   of last year it seemed like it was never   going to end 17 people 17 people one by   one by one they said Donald Trump is   inexperienced I've been in politics on   my life but I've been on the other side   of the equation i must say but one by   one by one and then they disappeared   some great people ben Carson supporting   us incredibly Mike Huckabee so many   great I mean so many good almost all of   them great people and we actually do   have a very unified Republican Party   I'll tell you but most importantly we're   going to make such great decisions for   this country we're going to make such   great you're going to be so proud but so   think of a june sixteenth of last year   and now it's four days away from the   change you've been waiting for your   entire life   you're gonna think back to this day and   you're gonna say that was a great day   that was a beautiful day I even like mr.   Trump's plane made in America by the way   was better than me he's made in America   I don't make them like that anywhere   else but you're going to say this was a   very very important day because it led   to your vote on november eighth or   whenever you do it before that is fine   just as long as you do it do it anytime   you want but do it and our country   started winning again we started winning   with trade we started doing things   properly we built up our military we   knocked the hell out of Isis we started   winning again we took care of health   care we got great health care at a much   much much lower cost it's unacceptable   but we started winning again together we   are going to make America wealthy again   we will make America so very strong   again we will make America safe again   and we will make America great again   thank you very much everybody thank you   God bless you everybody god bless you   get out and vote thank you thank you   everybody   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Applause]   [Music]   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   yes   [Music]   you   [Music]   you   you

there's no place safer that I   can tell you lata love is a la la la I   just want to tell you this and I needed   from the bottom of my heart is no   membrane if we went not me we went I'm   the message I've done a good job is the   message about fuck but we all know what   has to be done and we are going to do   something special on my promise in this   I will never ever let you down and not

are the   welders young and old rich and poor   black white is Santa but above all else   we're Americans and that's the support   where America   [Applause]   heard this word and while my opponent   Hillary Linda knife   how many years have we been saying this   name you know I keep hearing that she   wants to do this she wants to do that   where is he meant for 35 years she's   been doing this where has she been my   opponent slanders you as deplorable   and a word that has it been picked up to   the same extent irredeemable that means   you can't be made better or whatever   that means you're always going to be   deplorable right I don't think so I   don't think so I call you hard-working   American patriots who love your family   and love your country and you want is   you want to see it be better   [Applause]   Hillary Clinton's comments and they were   angry comments as you see her making   this I was watching I was starting to   fall asleep watching because it's hard   to stay awake l'espace so I'm starting   to doze off and then I heard the word   deplorable I said whoa an irredeemable   thinkable but her comments display the   same sense of arrogance and entitlement   that letter to violate federal law   secretary say hi and delete 33,000 email   think of it 33,000 but it really had to   do with yoga and the wedding yo so what   do we do we give yoga 5 and the wedding   three right where the rest o destroy   your phones and think of this with a   hammer bomb 13 fo put classified   information in the reach of our enemies   lie to Congress and self-government   favors and access to self-government   favors and asses it's the same attitude   of arrogance and entitlement that   explains why she has never taken   accountability for the disaster she   created in the Middle East what you're   seeing is largely a creation of Barack   Obama and Hillary Clinton   before she came into office Libya was   stable Syria was under control right you   just said it Iraq was seeing a reduction   in violence and Iran was being totally   choked off by sanctions they were not   they were not going to make the group we   today and you see today we call Isis   this is the group that was formed we   call Isis and it was close to being   extinguished now after Hillary here's   what we have Libya Syria and Iraq are a   total chaos Iran is on the path to   nuclear weapons and is becoming not a   local power but a world power so fast   how fast is the second they were dying   two years ago look what's happened and   remember the four hundred million in   cash well that turned out to be wrong   I'm sorry it turned out to be one point   seven billion in cash   but can you imagine can you imagine the   scene of 1.7 billion in cash different   denominations I mean the whole thing is   so it wasn't 400 really there was one   point seven billion who does this is   where were these people coming from and   now you look at Iran and they are bolded   they want to shoot down our airplanes   you see with the little boats going   around our ships you see that and   talking and talking they feel emboldened   after all of this oh boy oh boy oh boy   is going to be so different folks that   promise   [Applause]   can you imagine the captain on the   destroyer as they keep circling with his   little box he wants to shoot them out of   the water so bad he was standing there   like he's just looking just looking   saying what is going on where have we   where have we come in God Isis is   spreading everywhere and launching   attacks against the West her judgment on   the economy is so bad Hillary's donors   and advises are the same people who gave   us after the worst trade deal is a   history not of our country in the   history of our world there is never been   a trade deal as bad as dr. anywhere in   the world you looking upstate New York   you look into England you look at   Colorado you look at the manufacturing   that's been ripped out of Ohio and   Pennsylvania and everywhere and it's got   to Mexico and other places and I tell   the story because i have a friend better   than a consultant it costs me nothing he   is a great guy he builds plans and I   said to him how are you doing he said   I'm doing unbelievably we're building   the greatest plants in the world where   said to Mexico what about our country   not so much it's good to change bugs   good to go the opposite believe   they're loud China the entry into the   World Trade Organization you see where   that goes and now she wants to approve   trans-pacific partnership this will be   she called it the gold standard this   will be a disaster her policies have   produced suffering everywhere but   especially in our inner cities   forty-five percent of African Americans   under the age six are living in poverty   fifty-eight percent of african-american   youth are not employed more than 3,000   people have been shot in the city of   Chicago since January first can you   imagine by the way by the way that's   worse than Afghanistan that's worse than   these war-torn countries it's going   dangerous the jobs are gone the schools   are failing the communities are totally   unsafe and to the African Americans   living in those communities I say vote   for Donald Trump what do you have to   lose what happens I will fix it I will   fix it   I'll bring back your jobs and you   security and I'll fight for you hotter   than anyone has ever fought before he   cities have been run by the policies of   Hillary Clinton and her friends and I'm   telling you they're only getting worse   they're getting worse every time she   wants you vote and then she said see you   like in four years but hopefully we're   not going to be worried about   it is really sad it is really sad what's   happened to our inner cities they want   your vote and by the way the Democrats   have run them for 50 60 70 even a   hundred years uninterruptedly a hundred   years and look what you have I will fix   it remember that I will fix it what do   you have to lose somebody said oh that's   not a nice thing what do you have to   lose how can you be any more accurate   than that what do you have to lose   everywhere she goes scandal and failure   follow just look at what she did in   upstate New York's he promised 200,000   jobs and they ended up losing jobs   remember she was running for the said it   was a total disaster she said we're   going to bring jobs back it was a tote   she didn't bring anything with us just   the only people she delivers for our her   domes I'm going to deliver for the   American people I promise you   [Applause]   and I'm spending my money on this race   folks I'm spending my money I got a lot   of time energy and my money invested   that's for sure   so that includes lifting the   restrictions we have to do this on   American energy there's 50 trillion   dollars of untapped energy reserves in   our country and we're going to unlock   that vast potential   [Applause]   that's going to be an amazing unlocking   to believe me this one action alone will   raise the quality of life for tens of   millions of Americans will be a rich   country again we'll start paying off our   day will lower your taxes it's going to   be a very beautiful thing to watch   [Applause]   we're also going to completely reformed   our trade deals for ford motor company   just announced they're moving all of   their small car division they're moving   where are they moving they're moving to   Mexico   this won't happen if I'm elected   president believe me people are not   going to be sealing our companies and   we're not going to be losing our jobs   out of somebody like Ford or carrier or   all of these thousands of companies that   are moving if they think they're going   to move fire all their employees so we   get unemployment and we get no text   they're going to make product and brand   new plants is another country selling   into our country against and remember   this it will not be crossing a very very   strong boy okay very funny we're going   to charge them a thirty-five percent tax   on their product and you know what   they're gonna say they're going to say   we're not moving because if we have to   do that no longer makes sense to move   and the politicians could have done it   they could have done it they don't want   to do it because they're controlled by   special interests folks it's very soon   meanwhile if we just stop China from   stealing our intellectual property alone   with saved two million jobs a year we   don't even talk to China battle right   now our trade deficit a good all over   the world is nearly 800 billion dollars   a year think of it who makes these deals   what makes this dish we have a trade   deficit of 800 billion dollars a year   and then they say I'm against strike   while I'm against deals like that I can   tell   you better work I mean to better up   without this subtracts from our GDP our   economy grew only one point one percent   in the last quarter and that's a   catastrophe if China goes down to seven   or eight reset it's like a national   emergency we have 1.1 percentage of that   this is the weakest subfolder covery   since the Great Depression another 14   million people have left the workforce   and entirely it all came in in tiring   since president obama came into office   another major reform is going to be   school jobs i've outlined a plan to   provide every disadvantaged child in   America to choose the private-public   magnet or religious school of his or her   choice for those of you that believe in   education like I do this will help lift   millions of African American and   Hispanic children out of poverty since   President Obama came into office another   two million Hispanic Americans have   fallen into poverty this is unacceptable   to the Hispanic community I say we are   going to protect your jobs we are going   to build up your schools and we are   going to deliver safety and opportunity   to your children and you deserve   [Applause]   earlier this week along with my daughter

at a news conference well that's   a very good question Jim we're going to   hit him from the front on october seven   at three o'clock in the afternoon and   then we're going to attack them from the   back if we do well from the front but by   that time the front is so well fortified   we may not do as well okay now can you   imagine a single   i will give you good results don't worry   how I get there okay please   [Applause]   we had a clown today an absolute loud   rock with gates he's supposed to be an   expert in there forever by the way he   writes his book he says bad about   everybody that is working for he's been   there for a long time everybody that his   work for he's got he's a nasty guy   roughly has a problem that we don't know   about what he says nasty guy and he   spoke badly about bush he spoke badly   about amongst expanded about it never   met the guy never saw him I saw   Montalban did you like them the end   result was look where we are is a mess   okay he's the

gave us look at the best of   all of these people that have been there   for so many years look what we have look   at the Middle East if we never touched   if we would have been a hell of a lot   better off that we are right now wanna   shave all of the money but most   importantly the blood that a death and   what do we have now we're in worse shape   than we were 15 years ago by a factor of   10 and we spent six trillion dollars six   trillion that seems to be the new number   six trillion much more importantly the   lives that we've lost because we're   dealing with incompetent people we're   dealing with stupid people we're dealing   with people like Robert Gates that don't   have a clue and then when they leave   office they criticize everybody I don't   like critics I don't like British I like   the people that get it done and get it   done right   [Applause]   we need to embrace a new inclusive and   prosperous future we can do that jobs   will return it comes will rise and

supporter   right from the beginning so we want to   thank Rudy one of the issues I addressed   at length is the issue of government   corruption I put forward a plan to stop   it my opponent has no plan to end   government corruption because she is the   embodiment of government corruption the   embodiment   [Applause]   [Applause]   I have to be at you people in Naples you   have a lot of energy this is finished   and I like those pink signs the best I   hate to tell you I like them   I'll tell you what we're doing well in   the polls but you know I really think   those poles are very inaccurate when it   comes to women I think we're doing   better with women than with men Frankie   so we're setting records with men but i   want to set records with women to me and   i hate to tell them in this but if I   could swap I'd swap you out so fast you   you have no idea how fast well I want to   thank them in but i'll tell you the   women we have a lot of we have   tremendous support i appreciate   [Applause]   ha   [Applause]   is there any place that's more fun to be   and we're going to get a lot done   because come november eighth it's work   but right now we're having an amazing   time talking about our country and what   our country's going to be we're left at   all over the world our military is   depleted we owe 20 trillion dollars it   doubled in less than eight years under   Obama we are going to make America great   again folks but is there any place more   fun to be we love it a trump rally   and hopefully we're going to be having   Trump rallies for eight years and after   that let somebody else do it after that   somebody else is going to be doing even   as she was preparing to run for   president WikiLeaks emails show Hillary   was trying to get 12 million dollars   from the King of Morocco in yet another   pay-for-play scheme my goal is to keep   foreign money out of American politics   Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the   Oval Office up for sale to whatever   country offers the highest price that's   what she does   so I have a message today to the voters   of American it's a message for   Republicans and Democrats and   independents and everybody it's a   message for those living in rural   America urban American suburb in America   because we are all just one America oh   yeah and we're going to put again we are   going to put America first it's a   message for everyone who wants to take   back our government from special   interest and donors and I've been on the   other side folks believe me I was very   very comfortable there but I also knew   that our country was heading in the   wrong direction and bad bad things were   going to happen and you know when I   talked about inside or outside are sort   of the ultimate insider who was more of   an inside I get along with everybody   they loved me and then one day on june   sixteenth of last year coming down the   escalator with melania you know what I   became an outsider like they've never   seen before they left   but we're doing the right thing we had   to do it I love this country we had to   do it we had to do it so my message is   this if we win on november eighth we are   going to fix our rigged system it's a   rigged broken corrupt system it's rigged   it's broken its corrupt they want me to   take that back let me tell you folks   it's a rigged system and we are going to   drain the swamp of corruption in   Washington DC   [Applause]   you know everybody said I won the third   debate I won the second debate but the   third debate they didn't like the one   answer because they said all I talked   about this millions of people take a   look at the statistics and so they use   it they said well maybe he won but that   one answer I think the Pope is of people   here I think you understand that this is   a rig we're in a rigged system we're in   a broken and corrupt system and Bernie   Sanders was in a rigged system and now   he sees you notice how quiet has been   for the last three or four days because   he's been watching and reading WikiLeaks   WikiLeaks is talking about all of the   things they said behind his back they're   thinking about how about where they said   she has bad instincts that Hillary   Clinton has bad instincts this guy   Podesta is a nasty guy man I wouldn't   want people speaking like me you know   about me behind my back but he said bad   instincts Bernie Sanders said about   Hillary Clinton bad judgment so she's   got bad instincts she's got bad judgment   you take a look at all of the harm and   all of the things she's done it's a mess   she gave us Isis the vacuum heard obama   it started off as nothing remember the   JV team these are real genius to JV team   now it's in 32 countries and then she   gets up i will stop Isis she has no   chance they are dreaming that hillary   clinton becomes president Isis that   number one dream Hillary Clinton let her   become president she's the one that   allowed it to form she's the one that   watched it go now they say it's in 32   countries worse than ever the change   includes a new foreign policy that puts   America first Hillary Clinton's foreign   policy has squandered trillions of   American wealth overseas yet for all the   money spent all Clinton delivered was   death   destruction and terrorism all over the   world she unleashed Isis and the turmoil   in Iraq and Syria and Libya and by the   way our country because she's allowing   she's allowing from Syria five hundred   and fifty percent more people from Syria   the migration to come into our country   we don't know who they are and that's   over and above the thousands and   thousands of people that Obama is   letting pour into our country we have no   idea who they are but believe me it's   like the story of the Trojan horse and I   don't want people looking back at us in   a hundred years and 200 years and saying   that's the modern-day trojan or it's not   going to happen not going to happen   we're going to shut that door and we're   going to shut it tight   next trigger happy and you know she's   trigger happy she looks weak and she   looks ineffective and you watch her and   you watch her at the end of the debate   where she's like exhausted she could   hardly make it to her car oh let's get   out let's go the end of the debate two   of them she was like exhausted but she's   trigger happy and she wants to start   shooting wars in Syria what the hell are   we doing with Syria so now Russia's on   the side of Syria we created a monster   with Iran by giving them a hundred and   fifty billion dollars how about the 1.7   billion that we gave in cash that had   Philip this whole stage how about the   1.7 billion in cash that we thought was   400 million you remember how about the   800 people that were getting ready for   deportation because they weren't exactly   the finest you know in this country to   put somebody they've got to be bad so   they have 800 people ready for   deportation this is two weeks ago and   guess what happened they made a mistake   congratulations they became citizens of   the United States instead of being too   home   except that that was incorrect because   it wasn't 800 it was almost 1,800 people   to which I said okay you made a mistake   let's undo it undoing and send him out   they said we can't do that that would be   unconstitutional how stupid away how   stupid are our leaders so she's got bad   judgment she's got bad instinct and just   is reckless and far too reckless to be   allowed into the Oval Office I mean look   what she's done Hillary also started the   negotiations that led to the Iran deal   and thus ultimately leading to the 1.7   billion dollar think of it we paid 1.7   billion dollars for ransom you know you   can call it whatever you want and it was   in cash this man knows that was in cash   and it wasn't even in green because they   wanted denominations and they wanted   currency of other countries that's   probably because they figure anybody   that makes a deal so stupid I don't want   to bank on that deal anymore let me get   the currency from another country   Clinton gabar ran everything they wanted   and more including we gave them Iraq   folks we're fighting from also the   reason we went in in my opinion was   Obama wanted the show what a tough guy   he is before the election but it's not   working so good because they dug in so   about three months ago I started reading   that we're going to attack Mosul and the   reason we're attacking is and I've heard   this for a long time the ISIS leaders   are supposed to be ensconced and also   I've been here in that for a long time   everybody has right okay so if they're   there and these we do know this more   people right if they're there why are we   giving them all of this information what   happened to the element of surprise   remember the old little say the elements   of surprise so for three months of   reading we're going to muscle and we're   going to get those people out well those   people left about two seconds after they   heard they were   they're gone but what is it gone and who   isn't gonna fighters and they're using   human shields and they've got tunnels   and they've got and it's turning out to   be a mess we are so stupid we have the   stupidest leadership whether it's on   trade or in military but think about   muscle we want to get the leaders why   don't we go in and knock the hell out of   em and don't talk and let's talk let's   talk in about five days because you'll   knock them out fast with the leader so   the leaders now are gone and they have   fighters that are fighting to the death   and it's turning out to be very tough   and they are using human shields can you   imagine in this day and age can you   imagine the poor people living there   they're using human shields can you   imagine the great general george patton   or douglas macarthur or any of our great   generals can you imagine what these   people must think right spinning   spinning spinning in their grave the   stupidity of what we do so the people   that we want have long gone I've been   reading about it for how long three four   months that were going in why don't we   do it and then have the news conference   a week later to announce guess what we   had it totally successful we're going to   have a very much different country we're   going to have a great country again we   are the laughingstock of the world with   a laughing stock of the world now Iran   is in bold d revolted we gave all that   money we gave them everything they   wanted we have a clear path they have a   clear path to nuclear in 10 years   they'll go faster than that but they   have a clip if they decide to adhere by   the grid which they haven't they're   already testing missiles and everything   else and now they're rich as hell they   were ready to fail and we gave them all   this money we gave him all this power   and no matter what Kerry who took   crooked Hillary's place this guy never   walked the only time he walked was to be   in a bicycle race when he fell and broke   his leg right   then he walks in three weeks later on   crutches what a group what a group we   have a group of real losers that's what   we've got and the only thing Obama does   the only thing he does his campaign he   ought to work on jobs he ought to work   on our military so that instead of being   depleted it'll be the opposite he ought   to help our veterans who are being   treated horribly in the latest insult to   America the government of Iran did you   hear this one this just happened last   night is demanding quote quote many   billions of dollars in new ransom   payments for an American businessman and   his ailing father adding to the insult   Iran has released a video of their   captive that includes footage from   earlier this year of American soldiers   being forced to the knees at gunpoint   so we gave them back a hundred and fifty   billion dollars and don't forget our   sailors the ten cellars where they got   off course and instead of saying hey   folks come on get over there they   capture them they drop them to their   knees they're begging and the only   reason I released them is because the   payment started coming in the following   day stupid they're not so they released   them after making them humiliating them   and humiliating our country but now   they're asking for many billions of   dollars for the gentleman with his   father his father was very sick the   humiliation for our country never seems   to end it's a humiliation brought on by   a secretary of state who was more   interested in getting paid by foreign   countries than in representing the   country in which she lives to cover up   her crime is Secretary of State crooked   Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted   33,000 emails   [Applause]   phone   people   Oh   [Music]   Oh   [Music]   don't say it i don't want to hear it's   horrible so she is a piña over there   from Congress from Carlos his Congress   United States Congress sends a subpoena   she gets to subpoena she said oh this is   bad get rid of the all the evidence and   no problem who's representing us who the   hell is representing us and then and   then just so you understand to make it   even worse two days ago general donald   john cochran a great justice Donald   Trump's go on aim to something like that   that's crazy as you know but now he's   like and we want to change your what's   happening somebody's first alive so   let's say like one time she's lied   hundreds of times lied one time you know   what's the body now going to do   his life was destroyed tiny fraction   chance   including   Oh   [Music]   sell over government favors and accents   the Clintons end up with the money as a   marital trends opening which is some of   my humiliation when I'm president   America will be respected in the world   again and we won't have situations like   taking place right now in Iran that also   means standing up against the oppression   of the Castro regime in Cuban and   standing in solidarity with   freedom-loving people in Venezuela and   as you know doral which I own has a   great great Venezuelan community amazing   amazing people thank you and all across   Latin America people are living baby has   the moment that I don't think station   has obeyed and our friends a lot the   focus going forward he did

opening   brand new factories across this state we   are going to bring back the jobs and the   wealth that have been stolen from us the   economic policies of Bill and Hillary   Clinton have bled Pennsylvania dry you   know it I know it we've watched it   happen to corrupt Clinton's gave those   NAFTA China's entry into the World Trade   Organization the job-killing deal with   South Korea another Hillary disaster and   now she wants trans-pacific partnership   which will be absolutely unacceptable it   will take what NAFTA hasn't taken but   it'll all change in november eighth is   going to be a big big change big big   change   and as you all know real change begins   with immediately immediately repealing   and replacing the disaster known as   Obamacare   it's just been announced that the   residents of Pennsylvania where I went   to school by the way are going to   experience massive double-digit premium   hikes high high numbers I know your   number I will not tell you because   everybody's happy tonight I don't want   you leaving in a fit of depression I   refuse but you'll find out but it's not   going to matter because we're getting   rid of it you're going to end up getting   great health care at a fraction of the   course so don't worry about it in the   great state of Arizona premiums are   going up more than one hundred and   sixteen percent all 67 counties in   Pennsylvania are losing Obamacare   insurers next year you've heard about   that lot's of luck premiums to surging   companies are leaving insurers are   fleeing doctors are quitting and   deductibles are through the roof fifteen   sixteen seventeen thousand dollars in   some cases yet Hillary Clinton wants to   double down on Obamacare making it even   more expensive than it already is I'm   asking for your vote so we can repeal   and replace Obamacare and save health   care for every family in Pennsylvania   we'll do it we'll do it real change also   means restoring honesty to government   will start by getting rid of Clinton all   right that'll be a good start Hillary   Clinton is the most corrupt person ever   to seek the office of the presidency of   the United States   the investigations into our crimes will   go on for a long long time the rank and   file special agents at the FBI won't let   her get away with these terrible crimes   including the deletion of 33,000 emails   after receiving a congressional subpoena   right now she's being protected by a   rigged system you can't review 650,000   emails and eight days you can't do it   from Hillary Clinton is guilty she knows   it the FBI knows it the people the   people know it and now it's up to the   American people to deliver justice at   the ballot look we are going to deliver   justice the way justice used to be in   this country at the ballot box or   november eighth we are going to do   something so special it will be so   special it will be an amazing day it'll   be called brexit plus plus plus you know   what I mean and you know the polls are   coming in and these very very dishonest   people back there the media they're not   happy   and that happened they are not happy   folks we're leading in Ohio we're   leading in Iowa we're leading into   Hampshire we're leading in North   Carolina   [Applause]   you   [Music]   and they never show these crowds I never   show these clouds believe me they don't   show the crowds but I've learned two   things during this incredible tour   number one how great the American people   are and number two how totally dishonest   American media is spawned a leaf my   contract with the American voter begins   with a plan to end government corruption   and take our country back from the   special interests you know I used to be   on the other side in case you didn't   know but I love our country and I said   our country not only heading in the   wrong direction we weren't going to have   a country anymore you look at what's   happening trade 800 billion dollar   deficit worldwide trade our deals with   China we have a deficit of almost 500   billion dollars each year we weren't   going to make it folks we weren't going   to make it drugs pouring through our   borders our jobs take it away we'll   build a wall don't worry we will build I   promise we're building the wall and   Mexico will pay for the wall I problems   I want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment to hear the words we all   I'm your messenger just a messenger   doing a good job but just a messenger we   all are about to say when we win on   november eighth we are going to drain   the swamp   there's a great crowd and I just got   back from Michigan I'm actually can you   believe after this I go to Virginia   where we do what can you believe it will   call it will call it a midnight that'll   be my fifth of the day and then tomorrow   we have five or maybe six so we set them   up 24 hours one tweet and everybody   comes you've got to do that you've got   to get you've got to get to the ballot   box on November right that's the key we   have we have one of the great great   movements of all time we have the   greatest movement ever put together in   this country it's a movement of common   sense keeping our jobs strengthening our   military so many things you've got to go   and vote you've got to go and vote at   the core of my contract is my plan to   bring back our jobs Pennsylvania has   lost almost forty percent of its   manufacturing jobs since NAFTA NAFTA you   heard about NAFTA the worst the worst   trade deal ever signed by anybody at any   time it was a deal that was started and   signed by Bill Clinton and totally   supported by crooked Hillary Clinton   America has lost seventy thousand   factories since I think of that number   you know think about 700 that's a lot   right then think about 7,000 that's a   lot think about 70,000 factories we lost   how many jobs that is since China   entered the World Trade Organization   other bill and this was a bill and   hillary backed disaster also we're   living through the greatest jobs theft   in the history of the world no country   has ever lost their jobs like we do to   other countries because we're led by   stupid people we're led by people that   don't have a clue   what led by people that take money from   special interests and donors and they   want bad things to happen a trump   administration will stop the jobs from   leaving America believe me and we will   stop the jobs from leaving the great   state of Pennsylvania if a company wants   to fire their workers in Pennsylvania   moved to another country and then ship   their products back into the United   States we will make them pay a   thirty-five percent tax and believe me   they won't be leaving our country very   quickly believe me they could have done   that a long time ago but the politicians   never wanted to do it they never wanted   to do it and for bad reason a trump   administration will renegotiate NAFTA   and if we don't get the deal we want we   will terminate NAFTA and get a much   better deal for our workers and our   companies we will also immediately stop   the job-killing trans-pacific   partnership that'll take the rest of   your jobs well that's a Hillary deal she   said that's the gold standard then she   lied about it during the debate she also   lied about the fact that she didn't get   the questions can you believe she got   the questions to the debate and nobody   even talks about it and they don't even   write about it they don't even write   about it   they are the most bias dishonest people   can you imagine if Donald Trump got the   questions to the debate they would say   he must immediately stop his run she   gets the question nobody even talks   about it in other words he cheated like   a dog and nobody talks about it given to   her by donna Brazile nobody cares if I   got him it would not be a pretty picture   they would reinstitute the electric   chair right what a double standard and   all we want to do is make America great   again I mean it's like just a crazy   thing how they are how they react they   are very very dishonest people as part   of our plan to bring back jobs we are   going to lower taxes on American   business from thirty-five percent all   the way down to fifteen percent we were   with the highest tax nation in the world   we're now going to be among the lower   tax Nations we will massively cut taxes   for the middle class Hillary Clinton is   going to raise your taxes very very   substantially we will lift the   restrictions on American energy   including shale oil natural gas and   clean beautiful call put our miners back   to work hillary wants to shut down the   mines and she wants to ban shale   production not going to happen a trump   administration will unleash a shell   energy revolution and you know all about   shale you know more about shale than   anybody right here in Pennsylvania we   will also rebuild our inner cities we   are going to rebuild our inner cities   the african-american community the   Hispanic community has been treated very   very unfairly by our politicians they   want a vote and then they say thank you   very much i'll see you in four years f   that election we are going to rebuild   our inner cities we're going to bring   back jobs we're going to bring back   education we're going to bring back   safety safety so unsafe going to be very   happy I will tell you people are going   to be very happy we will become a rich   nation once again but to be a rich   nation we must also be a safe nation   Hillary Clinton wants a five hundred and   fifty percent increase in Syrian   refugees pouring into our country   [Applause]   and virtually unlimited immigration from   the most dangerous regions of the world   pouring into our country her plan will   import generations of terrorism   extremism and radicalism into your   schools and throughout your communities   when I'm elected president we will   suspend the Syrian refugee program and   we will keep radical Islamic terrorists   the hell out of our country I will tell   you that we will keep them out we have   enough problems folks we have enough   problems we have plenty of problems we   don't need these here in Pennsylvania   you've seen firsthand the problems   caused by refugee programs with large   numbers of poorly vetted refugees coming   into your state without your knowledge   support or approval a trump   administration will not admit any   refugees without the support of the   local community where they are being   placed be about time that people know   you have people bring brought into your   community nobody knows who they are even   your governors and your top politicians   aren't old we're going to change that   and we will pause admissions from tara   prone regions until a full security   assessment has been performed and until   a proven vetting mechanism has been   established we only want to admit those   into this nation who will support our   country and love our people a trump   administration will also secure and   defend the borders of the united states   and for that young gentleman that keeps   saying wall yes we will build a great   great wall   and Mexico will pay for that wall they   will pay for it they understand that   they will be paying for the wall   you   Hilary supports totally open borders   there goes your country and strongly   supports sanctuary cities like San   Francisco where Kate Steinle was   murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported perhaps more than five times   thousands of Americans would be alive   today if not for the open border   policies of Obama and Clinton this   includes Americans like Josh Wilkerson   whose mother I've gotten to know during   the campaign Josh a great student in a   high school was murdered at the age of   17 he was tortured strangled and beaten   to death by an illegal immigrant and   then his body was set on fire people   begged and they pleaded with the   authorities not to let this killer the   killer of Josh free incarcerate him send   him back to his country but the Obama   administration said no we won't do that   they said no a trump administration will   end this nightmare of violence believe   me we will protect American lives we   will cancel all federal funding to   sanctuary cities we will stop illegal   immigration to port all criminal aliens   and dismantle every last criminal gang   in cartel threatening our citizens we   will also repeal the obama-clinton   defense II question and rebuild our   badly depleted military we need our   militant   I'm honored to have the endorsement of   more than 200 top Admirals and generals   and 22 medal of honor recipients our new   foreign policy is going to always put   America first strange words you don't   hear those words you're going to hear   them plenty to all Americans I say it's   time for leadership it is time for   change just think about what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trump administration be so great we're   going to have the biggest tax cut since   Ronald Reagan even bigger add Hillary   Clinton wants to raise those taxes not   going to happen   we will save and protect your Social   Security and Medicare she will reduce   and cut your Social Security and   Medicare benefits we will eliminate   every unnecessary job-killing regulation   cancel every illegal Obama executive   order protect religious liberty rebuild   our military and take great care for   once and for all of our veterans are   great great veterans they are not being   treated properly provide school choice   and put an end to common core we're   bringing our education local support the   great men and women of law enforcement   we are going to save the Second   Amendment which is totally underseas   totally under seas and appoint justices   to the United States Supreme Court who   will uphold and defend the Constitution   of the United States it's time to cut   our ties with the failed politicians of   the past Hillary Clinton is the   candidate of yesterday she's been there   folks for 30 years it hasn't worked it   hasn't worked she wants to fight Isis   she's the one that started Isis when she   was

and gentlemen introducing the   next president of the United States   [Music]   this is a young group of people right   I'll tell you what and I want to thank   high point because it's a great school   great strong thank you and the big thing   is early voting starts here October 20th   so ideally you get out and you vote   right you get out early don't wait   november eighth is the big day but don't   wait october twenty if you start early   voting so if you can get it in there and   then you can just relax although on   november eighth you shouldn't relax you   should get all of your friends to vote   you know that right okay so it's   wonderful to be back in North Carolina   an incredible place we won this in the   primers as you remember and it was a big   victory and so I have a warm warm spot   in my heart I was an important victory   come november eighth we're going to win   this state and we're going to win back   the White House it's about time we're   going to win back   and we're going to bring back your jobs   which have been ripped out of our   country we're bringing back your jobs   we're going to cut your taxes massively   and you know people don't understand but   Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes   very substantial tax and crazy so people   don't understand that we're going to   renegotiate our disastrous trade deals   we're going to protect our country from   radical Islamic terrorism that one's not   even close over the weekend there were   Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota   New York City and in New Jersey these   attacks were made possible because of   our extremely open immigration system   which fails to properly vet and screen   the individuals or families coming into   our country attack after attack from   9-11 to San Bernardino to Orlando we   have seen how failure to scream who is   entering the United States puts all of   our citizens in great danger so let me   state this very very clearly and as you   know at least most of you know I've been   saying this for a long time this didn't   just happen like yesterday immigration   security is national security   now I assume she'll be changing this but   you know what's been happening my   opponent has the most open borders   policy of anyone ever to seek the office   of presidency it's not even close as   Secretary of State she allowed thousands   of criminal aliens to be released into   our communities because their home   countries wouldn't take them back they   were too bad they didn't want them so we   took him now Obama wants to bring in as   of two days ago an additional one   hundred and ten thousand refugees and   Hilary wants I mean honestly honestly   it's hard to believe and Hilary wants a   five hundred and fifty percent increase   in Syrian refugees altogether Hillary   Clinton's plan would bring in six   hundred and twenty thousand refugees in   her first term alone with no effective   way to screen or vet them her plan would   cause four hundred billion dollars in   terms of lifetime welfare and   entitlement costs this isn't just a   matter of terrorism but also a matter of   quality of life and many of you are just   starting off on this incredible journey   and it is about quality of life and it's   about safety it's about safety sorry   have to have a safe country we want to   make sure we are only admitting people   into our country who love our country my   highest duty as president is to protect   our citizens and to uphold the   Constitution of the United States I will   honor that duty to the fullest extent   every single day and I will never waver   in that sacred obligation it's just a   plain fact that our current immigration   system makes no real attempt to   determine the views of the people   entering our country we have no idea who   they are what they think since nine   eleven hundreds of immigrants and their   children have been implicated in   terrorism and terrorist related activity   within the United States now we learned   that another 858 immigrants it's just   the other day from dangerous countries   have slipped into our country and been   granted citizenship despite the fact   that they were supposed to be deported   they probably press the wrong button on   a computer so they were supposed to be   deported and they were given citizenship   welcome to America   we're going to build a wall we're gonna   we're gonna we're gonna build we're   going to build the wall Mexico is going   to pay for the wall one hundred percent   but the over 800 people really had   nothing to do with the wall you know   they had to do with a lot of other   things and it's a very very sick can you   imagine we made them citizens and they   were getting ready for deportation so if   something was very wrong or they press   the wrong button at a computer but   either way can have it all together   there are nearly 1 million individuals   in the United States with deportation   orders who have not yet been removed in   the 20th century the United States   defeated fascism Nazism and communism   now we must defeat radical Islamic   terrorism   yet my opponent won't even say the words   radical Islamic terror in fact Hillary   Clinton talks tougher about my   supporters than she does about Islamic   terrorists   she calls the patriotic Americans who   support our campaign many of them cops   and soldiers deplorable and irredeemable   has she ever talked that way about   radical Islam or about those who oppose   and murder women and gays overseas no   has Hillary Clinton ever called people   to support these practices deplorable or   irredeemable know in many countries   overseas non-believers face the death   penalty whether it's Hillary's   condemnation I mean where is it where is   her condemnation of these people where   is their condemnation of these countries   let's ask Hillary how many people who   subscribe to radical Islamic views and   support the oppression of non-believers   would you call deplorable were   irredeemable that's a terrible word that   hasn't been reported but that was a word   that you used are those words reserved   only for hardworking Americans that   truly truly support us and truly love   our country seems that way America can   never elect a president like Hillary   Clinton who apparently with her choice   of words thinks that the decent American   citizens are bigger threat than radical   Islam can't do this anyone who cannot   name our enemy is not fit to lead this   country remember   and if you can't name your enemy you   don't know what the problem is and if   you don't know what the problem is   you're never going to fix the problem   anyone who cannot condemn the hatred   oppression and violence of radical Islam   lacks the moral clarity to serve as our   president the commander-in-chief of this   nation must speak with moral clarity and   conviction our system of government is   the best in the world and as your   president I will defend our values and   speak out against those who assault our   values in any way shape or form right   it's also time to remember one very   important word accountability all this   disaster with Isis happened on Hillary   Clinton's watch happened with her her   bad judgment her bad decision making her   policies in Iraq and Libya and Syria are   responsible for the rise of Isis her   attacks on me are all meant to deflect   from her record of unleashing this   monstrous evil upon us you ever notice   all she does is attack me constantly   attack attack everyone says you should   never have your successful never run for   political office but that's the kind of   person you need hate to tell you that   that's what we need but they've always   said all my life all of my life I've   heard of your successful never run for   political office but it's time we have   to bring our country back we have to   make our country great again we have to   do something because it's not working   right now the way it is her time chart   bow and it's you know this is so true   her timetable and withdrawal from Iraq   her push for regime change at Libya and   Syria her open border policies these are   the actions that unleashed the ISIS   disaster so she will say and do anything   to distract from that record of total   failure and let's see how much she   changes her policies over the next   couple of days because she's been for   open borders she's for people pouring in   from Syria she's from all of these   things I think it's getting very hard   for anybody that's rational or even sane   if you look at it I mean how can people   believe this way how can they do that   how can people believe this when they   see what's happening all over the world   look at Germany look at what happened to   merkel then the recent election look at   what's going on we have to use common   sense we have to be smart we have to be   tough we have to be vigilant her claimed   that my opposition to radical Islamic   terrorism   is a recruiting tool to what how does   that have to do with I'm being tough why   is that a recruiting I'm much tougher   than her on this problem is horrible   situation but she goes around saying   it's a recruiting tool you know somebody   gave her that from Madison Avenue you   know about it that's advertising they   gave her that from it they said let's   call it a recruiting tool but why   because I'm tough it's a recruiting tool   it demonstrates a level of ignorance   about the terror threat that really is   disqualifying for a person seeking the   presidency when she says my opposition   to radical Islamic terror provides aid   and comfort to the enemy we know that   Hillary Clinton has once again   demonstrated that she's really unfit for   office   her comments are not only reckless but   beneath the dignity of the office that   she seeks Isis is torturing murdering   executing and exterminating people in a   campaign of genocide and what is Hillary   Clinton suggesting what is she   suggesting you know what you see let's   let more people come in that we should   censor our vocabulary so as not to upset   these butchers I have news for Hillary   refusing to call out radical Islam will   not lessen the danger it will only   increase and embolden the danger just   like we have seen during her disastrous   and fail term as Secretary of State it   emboldened   just like Iran is emboldened you look at   Iran they're emboldened they made this   deal and instead of becoming our friend   it looks to me like it's gotten worse   the rise of Isis is Hillary Clinton's   foreign policy legacy one of them many   others that are not good Secretary   Clinton has helped to toppled regimes   displace millions and then open the door   to Isis potentially to enter this   country now you think of this it's a   disaster so how is this policy a smart   policy Clinton's decisions overseas have   left us with the threat we face today   and her immigration policies will invite   this thread onto our shores as soon as   you as sure as you are there in front of   me standing watching that's going to   happen right onto our shores it's   happening we must stop the massive   inflow of refugees which Hillary Clinton   is trying to drastically increase now   she may change your mind because this is   what's been happening for a long time   but it's getting harder and harder   because how are you electable when you   have policies like that we should   temporarily suspend immigration entirely   from regions where safe and adequate   screening and I mean extreme vetting   cannot occur   right pew polling shows that in many of   the countries from which we draw a large   numbers of immigrants extreme views   about religion such as the death penalty   for those who leave the faith are   commonplace the death penalty it's the   job and really of government to admit   those and only those who we expect to   succeed in to flourish here and become   part of our incredible country and home   [Applause]   Hillary Clinton disagrees with his   common sense rule and it's one more   reason why she will not win the election   on november eight it's time to break   with the corruption the bad judgment and   the failures of the past it's time to   have a new American future we are going   to change our immigration system to   reflect American values we're going to   stop the policy of regime change   overseas and instead focus on working   with our allies on a military campaign   to utterly destroy Isis and defeat   Islamic terrorism this will not only   require military warfare but also   financial warfare cyber warfare an   ideological warfare but to win this   struggle we need to be strong at home   we're going to rebuild our country our   infrastructure is a disaster our country   is a mess with 20 trillion dollars in   debt thank you for 20 trillion dollars   at the center of the effort will be in   fact the rebuilding of our inner cities   nearly four and ten african-american   children live in poverty including forty   five percent of african-american   children under the age of six think of   them fifty-eight percent of   african-american youth are not working   violent crime rose in America's 50   largest cities last year it went through   the roof homicides are up nearly fifty   percent in Washington DC and more than   sixty percent in Baltimore more than   3,000 people have been shot in Chicago   since January think of it since yeah   near 3,000 people that's like worse than   the war-torn nations that   you're looking at that's worse than   Afghanistan the schools are failing the   jobs are leaving and millions are   trapped in poverty so to the   african-american community I say vote   for Donald Trump I will fix it I will   fix it   I will bring back your jobs I will fix   your schools and I will fight for your   safety you'll be safe it's time for new   civil rights agendas and one that   promises safe communities great   education and a good paying job now I   say this and I say this all the time   what do you have to lose your education   is broken your communities are unsafe   there are no jobs it's been run by   Democrats for sometimes up to a hundred   years unbroken what do you have to lose   I will fix it my whole life so true so   true they've really let you down they   ask for your vote you give me a vote   year after year you give me a vote then   in the presidential at Lisa and every   other one but in the presidential they   say hey see you man see in four years   that's what they do they say see in four   years we'll be back and then they come   back and they promised your things and   nothing happens and you vote so it's   time to change what do you have to lose   I will fix it remember them my whole   life   has been about creating jobs thousands   and thousands of jobs Hillary Clinton   has spent her career destroying jobs   just look at upstate New York and her   terrible trade deals Hillary supported   NAFTA she supported China's entrance   into the word World Trade Organization a   disaster and she supported the   job-killing deal with South Korea that   helped make them a fortune and us we   lost jobs we lost factory we lost money   the South Korean deal was supposed to   create 70,000 jobs instead we lost a   hundred thousand jobs and our trade   deficit with South Korea has more than   doubled these are the deals we make next   Hillary Clinton wants to approve the   trans-pacific partnership that deal will   be a disaster for North Carolina for   every state your state your state has   lost more than four and ten   manufacturing jobs since NAFTA signed by   her husband I'm going to renegotiate   this disastrous deal and if we don't get   the deal we want we'll walk away and   we'll start all over again   our trade deficit with the world is   nearly 800 billion dollars a year think   of that 800 billion dollars you almost   say who's negotiating these deals we   have a trade deficit worldwide of almost   800 billion this is really the economic   legacy of Hillary Clinton now four more   years of obama four more years of   clinton you can't do it you can't do it   people aren't going to take it but we're   going to turn it all around my economic   agenda can be summed up in three very   beautiful words jobs jobs jobs   I'm going to get rid of massive   absolutely massive amounts of   unnecessary regulations and your tax   cuts are going to be so happy you're   going to be so happy when you bring all   that money on Big Texan she'll raise   taxes i'm lowering taxes that's a big   difference I'm going to repeal and i'm   going to replace Obamacare which has   turned out to be an economic disaster   for family i'm going to create American   energy independence I'm going to make   our government lean responsible and   efficient I'm going to fix our terrible   trade deals and defend the American   worker I'm going to rebuild our depleted   military and take care of our great   veterans and I'm going to appoint   justices to the Supreme Court who will   follow the Constitution of the United   States   we will rebuild our roads our bridges   our tunnels highways airports schools   and hospitals American cars will travel   the roads American planes will soar the   skies and American ships will again   patrol the Seas and it's about time   American steel will send news look you   know all about skyscrapers right anybody   going to be an architect anybody going   to be a developer developer any   developers any young develop a 12 he's   already a developer American steel will   send those new skyscrapers into the   clouds American hands will rebuild this   nation an American energy harvested from   American sources will power our nation   American workers will be hired to do the   job   we will put new American steel into the   spine of this country I will fight for   every neglected part of our nation every   single part of this great nation and I   will fight to bring us together as one   American people imagine what our country   could accomplish if we started working   together as one people under one God   saluting one flag   [Applause]   it's time to break with the bitter   failures of the past and to embrace a   new inclusive prosperity and the   American future because that's what it's   going to be new factories are going to   come rushing in they're going to come   rushing rushing in you wait till you see   what happens we will incentivize people   to stay and they will be decentralized   if they leave our country they're not   going to just come out fire all our   people build product outside of the   country and sell it into our country so   easily it's going to be a whole   different ballgame and now they'll say   you know what I think we're not leaving

interests a lobbyist and the   corrupt corporate media that have rigged   the system against every single American   I've been reading stories over the last   couple of days that are so inaccurate   and so dishonest I have never seen   anything like it in my life and I'm   willing to take it on because and I   didn't eat it believe me I didn't need   have a great company I built this great   company and somebody said you know he   could be at a point where he's enjoying   the fruits of his labor in here i am   working harder than ever before i'm like   a lot of people in the different rooms   in the different stadiums where true   where we're 18 years ago their wages in   real wages were higher than they are   today they had one job now they have two   jobs they're working much harder much   harder than making much less money and   that's what's happened in our country   and the only thing I can say is I'm also   working harder okay so we're working   harder together we're working a lot   harder together and I'm spending a lot   of money on my campaign I'm spending   tremendous tens and tens and tens   millions of dollars and I like it   because you know what we're not going to   be controlled we're not going to be   controlled so important   we're not going to be control we're   going to we're going to take our country   back and it's going to be a beautiful   thing this is a movement we have a   movement going on like I think they've   never seen before and everybody's   talking about it the big thing is on   november eighth we have to get out there   folks otherwise this movement will be   wonderful to read about some day but you   know what it won't mean a damn thing   okay won't mean to me won't mean a damn   thing we're going to create new   government that serves you your family   in your country lower taxes by a lot   less regulation more affordable   childcare fair trade deals secure   borders thriving family farms millions   and millions of new jobs we're going to   end the clinton corruption total crap   horrible horrible what's going on to   this country is horrible and restore   dignity and honesty to government   service Hillary Clinton is an insider   fighting for her donors and her insiders   mostly fighting for herself I am an   outsider fighting for you were fighting   together fighting today everything you   need to know about Hillary Clinton can   be understood with this simple phrase   follow the money and believe me that's   what's happened in her campaign for   president Hillary Clinton has received   100 million dollars in contributions   from wall street and the hedge funds she   received 4.1 million dollars in speaking   fees from financial firms I'd like to   see what she said where are the papers   Bernie Bernie was asking for the papers   but Bernie gave up the same groups   paying bill and hillary for their   speeches were lobbying the federal   government 22 groups paying bill clinton   for speeches lobbied the State   Department while Hilary was Secretary of   State and don't forget that Clinton   contributors were appointed to advisory   boards by the Secretary Clinton or all   the favors and access was granted and   guess what they wrote checks the favors   were granted and all of these people who   are at least a lot of them wrote checks   she even gave up twenty percent of   uranium you know what happens with   uranium don't you   and who controls that twenty percent   Russia Russia Russia she disgraced the   office of Secretary of State by putting   it up for sale and if she ever got the   chance she would put the Oval Office up   for sale too and nobody has any doubt   about it and we can't let that happen   that's why you have to go out and vote a   november eighth and early voting in Iowa   starts tomorrow get out don't take a   chance   don't take your chance   [Applause]   you not take a chance she deleted and   bleached 33 thousand emails nobody ever   heard of the bleaching nobody ever heard   of it and they don't use it's a very   expensive process people don't use it   but she used it and nobody understands   how she can get a congressional subpoena   she gets the subpoena this didn't happen   before the subpoena she gets the   subpoena and she then goes out and she   deletes 33,000 emails you know if   somebody Sue's you and they want your   records and you do that as a private   citizen it's you know where you go she   gets a congressional subpoena and I'm so   disappointed with the people in   Washington for allowing her to get away   with this I'm so disappointed and that   means on both sides by the way I am so   disappointed when they say there's   nothing they can do there's nothing they   can do   she gets rid of thirteen phones how many   people have gotten rid of thirteen   phones and how many people got one hand   what business are you in what's your   business I think he was just a wise guy   about something but she destroyed a   number of them with a hammer how many   people have destroyed an iphone or a   phone with a hammer anybody in the room   huh a couple of hands go up I don't know   if they're kidding i think they're   kidding but who knows her staffers   taking the Fifth Amendment how about   that and her ringleaders getting   immunity is down she has people taking   the fifth amendment four people plus the   guy who illegally did the server you   know he put in the illegal server so   there are five people taking the fifth   amendment like you see on the mob right   you see the mob takes of it if you're   innocent why you're taking the fifth   amendment   [Applause]   and then they read a whole list of   charges she's guilty on every one of   them and then what do they say but   that's okay and yet other people that   have done two percent of what she did   their lives have been destroyed you tell   me you tell me what's going on with our   country what's going on with our   government foreign enemies with easy   access to hacker server lies to Congress   under oath about turning over her   work-related emails which are largely   destroyed although I have a feeling they   could get emails you know I've always   heard you really can't destroy humans I   don't think they tried too hard to get   them to you does anybody think I don't   think they tried too hard the Clintons   have perfected the politics of profit   but more importantly when you look at   what's happening I think it has more to   do with other things large corporations   who support terrible trade deals and   offshore jobs and they're donating to   the Clintons when you look at some of   the deals that we all have to suffer   with and you look at the deals that are   made a lot of those deals it's not   because the politicians are so stupid   now in some cases they are seriously but   not all probably in most they aren't   friend of mine said to me how is it   possible that such and such a deal was   made and then you look at who's making   contributions to the campaign and you   see why the deal is made okay it's very   sad when you look at and what does it   mean it means our jobs are fleeing our   country our companies that employ the   people are leaving from Mexico and other   places China can devalue their currency   and do whatever they want The Wall   Street investors who have rigged the   regulations against the middle class   they're donating to Hillary Clinton   they're certainly not donating to me the   wealthy donors who want to shut down   American energy they're donating to   Hillary Clinton and by the way ethanol   we like ethanol   right you like afternoon special   interests who want open borders are   donating to Hillary Clinton and you have   your problems here with open borders and   I've been hearing a lot about open   borders even hear you don't think of   this part of the world for open borders   you have your problems a lot of people   are telling me that's why Hillary   Clinton is pushing I will build a wall   we will build that wall okay we're going   to throw the world we're going to build   a wall and Mexico is going to pay for   the wall believe me one hundred percent   Mexico is doing very well thanks to the   United States Mexico is very happy with   the United States Mexico's leaders are   so much smarter than our leaders so   Hillary Clinton's pushing for five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees coming into our country   it's actually unbelievable I have to be   you know I said up here and I stand up   here and I do all of these speeches and   discussions and I read all I read and I   see all I see and you hear a thing like   that five hundred and fifty percent   increase in fact i used to say five   hundred percent and the president Trump   is wrong so I figured well I figured its   three four five hundred percent lower   they said he was wrong it's actually a   five hundred and fifty percent increase   in other words she's allowing more they   even correct you on the upside that's   the first time that ever happened she   and her financial backers will say   anything to do anything they lie about   anything to keep their grip on power to   keep their control over the country the   American people have had it with corrupt   Clinton ways they've had it   they're tired of the lies they're tired   of trivial politics they're tired of   being talked down to look down upon and   treated like second-class citizens smart   people not being treated right how many   more Clinton scandals can this country   take one after another after another you   know the story folks you've seen it for   years and years and we can't take   another four years of Barack Obama and   we can't take it out of the four years   of crooked Hillary Clinton you can't do   it   they're the suited pass we're gonna have   a bright future we're going to make   America great again we're going to make   America greater than ever before we can   do that but if we don't win this   election it'll never ever happen I tell   you what we're never going to have   another shot this is it the tables will   be turned and it'll be too late well our   campaign outlines big changes and bold   solutions to make your life better the   Clinton campaign focuses only in small   and petty distractions never in American   history have so many serious challenges   been met with so unserious a campaign as   the campaign of Hillary Clinton and I'll   tell you what you know we had to debate   the other night and every single online   poll had we winning by sometimes a   landslide and then you go on television   and these are Time magazine Drudge   phenomenal man Drudge big big groups I   mean other than I'm on the cover of Time   magazine a lot but they had no friends   of mine believe me and I'm winning by   massive margins in many cases and one   was eighty percent to twenty percent but   I'm winning all of these polls how many   were there seven or eight or nine   hundreds of thousands of votes and then   I have to sit back and you have to sit   back in here how those polls don't mean   anything but when they pull 300 people   that means a lot right and so we won   every single online poll hundreds and   hundreds of thousands of voters and then   you sit back and you hear how she did so   well in the debate I don't think she did   well in the debate at all I don't think   she said well at all   and I just walked in and I saw some of   the great people that represent your   state and they said wow you did so great   in the debate and we understand it we   understand it and we'll see as the poll   start coming out the other polls having   to do with the States but I hear we're   doing very well we're leading in Ohio   we're leading in Florida we're leading   in North Carolina here we're doing very   well and they are not happy back there   those people back there with the cameras   they are not happy they are not happy   now they're very dishonest this will be   the year the American people say enough   is enough   it's time for real change a new foreign   policy a new economic policy and new   immigration policy and a new trade   policy Hillary Clinton a vessel for   special interests trying to strip this   country of its wealth its jobs and its   status as a sovereign nation she's a   globalist who has made a career of   taking jobs from this country and giving   them so stupidly and so sadly to other   countries you've been seeing it for   years and years and years it's going to   stop it's no longer going to be a one   lane highway going out of our country   with our jobs at our money it's no   longer going to be I'm not running to be   President of the world I'm running to be   President of the United States and we're   going to protect your wrinkles   from now on it's going to be America   first have you out there it's gonna be   great right we gonna have a good time   and you have a good time when you love   what you're doing I always tell people   when they ask me for advice pick   something you love we love our country   we love what we're doing it's   inconvenient at this time of the day for   many of you to be here but you here and   we love you we love you too right but we   love our country and that's why we're   doing it you have wondered why is it   that all things the American people want   never seemed to happen it never seems to   happen simple things we want to create   jobs they go to China they go all over   the place China makes our product China   cheats us you know when we talk free   trade these are stupid people when we   talk free trade it's supposed to be free   trade so China sentence product in no   tax please come in they dump steel they   hurt our steel workers they do so many   different things you try selling into   China I have many friends that are   manufacturers it's impossible for them   to do business in China and then   sometimes China would say all right come   build a plant but they don't even want   that they want their people to build the   plant they don't even want that to one   way street and you know where the   streets going to lead you know it you   know the result I said the other day I   said we're in a big bubble the only   thing we have going is a phony Wall   Street because the interest rates are so   low because the Fed is controlled by the   politicians never happened before why   can't we have the schools that we want   and the borders that we want and the   security that we want   why can't we have policies that support   small businesses or family farms or the   miners and the steelworkers why can't   wait and by the way for the family   farmers Hillary Clinton's plan proposes   an estate tax of sixty-five percent   sixty-five percent so you can have a   state tax of up to sixty-five percent   lot's of luck having your kids hold on   to your farms not going to happen the   answer is simple because the financial   interest to control our politics and our   media don't want these changes to happen   these special interests they control and   they have total control over Hillary   Clinton they give her so much money boy   she's got a lot of money I have had more   commercials I am I just want to see a   regular ivory snow commercial I'm dying   she has got so much and somebody said   she's going to out commercial us 50 to 1   don't think of it is that possible 51   think of it now she's spending hundreds   of millions of dollars and I think we're   leading I don't know where the tide are   leading right   which tells you how bad she is honestly   I truly believe this Hillary Clinton is   incompetent she's incompetent I really   believe this you know I told somebody   that they said no that's not possible   she failed her bar exam in Washington DC   and I said I'm not that surprised   actually but I'm telling you she's   incompetent and she's certainly   incompetent for you that I can tell you   that I know for sure she's their chosen   representative you can disregard   everything she said and just remember   this raise follow the money she's there   for one reason and that's to protect her   donors and special interest you look at   a career she's been there and I brought   this up the other night at the debate   first time really she's been there for   30 years almost and she's never done   anything for you and your family now she   wants to do this she wants to fight Isis   Isis wouldn't be there if her and Barack   Obama ended the war the way it was   supposed to be ended and didn't create   the big vacuum   and I'd bet if he had it to do over   again knowing what he knows he would   have never picked her a secretary of   state I bet you she's failed at   everything she's failed in Iraq she's   failed in Libya she's failed in Syria   she's failed in Iran how about the Iran   deal how about that that was the   beginning of that deal don't forget that   was her genius that got that one that's   one of the great catera how about 400   million in cash going to these guys and   then they made a mistake right they made   a mistake it wasn't for a hundred I said   oh good maybe it was like 1,000,000 now   what 1.7 billion it wasn't 400 it was   1.7 billion in cash do you know what   that looks like that would fill up the   whole corner of this room up halfway to   the ceiling cash cash and one of the   things that Obama or somebody said well   we couldn't open up normal check-in   relations so we had to give it to him   cash where did these people come from   where do they come from chief elder on   Russia on China and on North Korea she   failed in upstate New York you know when   she ran for the Senate upstate New York   is it's a disaster what's happened up   there are jobs have all flown to Mexico   our companies have all left and they've   gone not all but massive massive numbers   have gone to Mexico in other countries   and what he was running for the Senate I   remembered so much it sounded so   wonderful we are going to create 200,000   new jobs in upstate New York didn't   happen because once your lecture was   over she went to Washington she named   the road she named a post off chic past   three bills there were nothing those   three namings that's all she did did   nothing she did nothing and what   happened in upstate New York is a   disaster you have to see it now that's   why I one in the primers New York in a   massive landslide in a landslide because   people are tired   of what's going on in our country and   they're tired of what's going on in   politics so I really believe that you   take a look and I said I think that   we're going to have a turn out like   you've never seen before she failed the   inner cities she's failed women and   children I've created thousands of jobs   for women in this country women of   incredible talent Hillary Clinton has   been a Washington for many many years   and now 70 million America this 70   million American women and children are   in poverty or the brink of poverty in   our country this is in the United States   of America and she's been a disaster on   the borders let him in let him in   Hillary Clinton supports sanctuary   cities which is basically sanctuary for   some very tough paper where was the   sanctuary for Americans like Sarah root   the beautiful daughter of mrs. root who   you just met the only people Hillary   Clinton has ever really delivered for   her her special interests and her donors   her single greatest achievement maybe   getting away with her massive email   scandal and her criminal cover-up I   think it's her greatest achievement   our campaign is taking on big business   and big media and big donors we're   taking them on for you we're going to   see maybe we'll do it and maybe we won't   but if we win you're gonna be so happy   and so proud and you'll have the future   for you and your children and your   grandchildren that you want because if   we don't make that turn now including   the appointment of Supreme Court   justices this country is in big big   trouble   and even senator Ted Cruz endorsed me   the other day and I know the people of   Iowa like Ted Cruz but he endorsed this   the other day and I thought that was   very good that includes and we have to   include this we have to keep your   family's safe new FBI statistics show   that homicide rose fifteen percent last   year in America's large cities and that   it's the largest single year increase in   45 years you don't hear this stuff you   only hear it from Trump but let me tell   you you'll also hear positive for Trump   because we're going to turn things   around somebody said gee whiz it's not a   very optimistic message and somebody   else that actually is very optimistic   because we explained the problem and   then we fix it like you have to know the   problem like Obama and Hillary Clinton   they don't want to say radical Islamic   terrorism I don't want to talk about it   and if you're not going to explain the   problem you're not going to fix it more   than 3,000 people listen to this have   been shot in Chicago since January think   of it it's hard to believe from I   already 3,000 people have been shot   since January not since like 30 years   ago since January sixty percent of   murder victims under the age of 22 in   this country are african-american forty   five percent of african-american   children under the age of six a living   in poverty I will never back down from   fighting to save American lives we can   okay   I will never back down from fighting to   create safety and wealth for our inner   cities my economic agenda can be summed   up in three very beautiful words you   know what they are jobs jobs jobs we   will cut your taxes massively and by the   way she has a major tax increase reduce   regulations including to our farmers our   farmers are getting absolutely destroyed   with regulating negotiate great trade   deals instead of the horrible deals that   we have to live under right now like   NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton unleash   American energy and we are going to   repeal and replace Obamacare   we're going to protect the renewable   fuel standard and corn based ethanol   we're also going to end common core and   offer school choice to every   disadvantaged child including every poor   Hispanic and african-american child in   America the people getting rich off the   rig system are the people throwing their   money at Hillary Clinton remember follow   the money our campaign is about breaking   up the special interest monopoly in   Washington DC we're trying to disrupt   the collusion between the wealthy donors   the large corporations and the media   executives they're all part of the same   political establishment they go to the   same restaurants they attend the same   conferences have the same friends and   connections and some of them even like   me I'll be honest with you but that   doesn't matter and they're not along   when Hillary Clinton slanders you as   deplorable and as irredeemable your   irredeemable they said now I don't think   so people don't know how great you are   people don't know how smart you are   these are the smart people these are the   smart people these are really the smart   people and they never like to say it but   I say it and i'm a smart person these   are the smart we have the smartest   people we have the smallest people and   they know it and some say it but they   hate to say it but we have the smartest   people government will start working   again fixing things is what I do just   look at my projects in New York and   around the world where I revitalize   neighborhoods and lift it up skylines   and I'd like to say that but this is the   kind of president we need it's not that   I want to say it   an article that appeared recently in the   New York Post was called how Donald   Trump helped save New York City the   article said quote Trump waded into a   landscape of empty Fifth Avenue   sufferance the Dust Bowl mugging ground   that was central park and a wall street   area seemingly on its last legs as   companies moved out of New York City   Trump almost by will row to the rescue I   hate to read this to you I'm embarrassed   expressing rare faith in the future he   was instrumental in kick-starting the   regeneration of neighborhoods and   landmarks almost given up for dead in   fact I had our great mayor mayor   Giuliani he knows rudinos and he did a   fantastic job that's what I want to do   for our country I want to go into the   neglected neighborhoods and the great   neighborhoods and all neighborhoods I   want to fix the failing schools the   Forgotten stretches of this nation I   want to unlock their potential for all   of our people together we can accomplish   anything we want but that means you need   to show up and vote in november eight   that it means you need to start voting   immediately   don't forget early voting you have to   knock on doors you have to pick up that   phone you have to get everybody if you   have somebody that says I'm sorry Harold   I can't make it today I'm so so sick I   don't think I'll be able to get out of   bed you look at that person you say get   out of bed you have no choice you have   to campaign on the streets spread the   love that we have in this room to all of   the people in your state and in your   country to beat the system remember I   was the one long time ago when I was   winning states and I wasn't getting   delegates remember and i was saying   what's going on remember I went to   Louisiana and I wasn't expected to win   the evangelicals were great there too   and I went down and I said let's give it   one shot and I gave it a speech at a   massive airplane hangar we had   unbelievable thousands and thousands of   people and I left that was on a Friday   night the election was on a Saturday and   I said this doesn't look like the crowd   of a second place a third-place finisher   by that time I think they were down from   17 to about 12 people and I one big   Saturday night i won big and then I'm   looking at delicates listen wait a   minute how come I have fewer delegates   than people that I beat and they said my   people they got so used to it well sir   that's the way the system is I said when   something wrong with the system and   that's what I said the system's rigged   and Bernie Sanders had the rig delegates   and Bernie Sanders had the rigged DNC   the rig do you remember Deborah   Wasserman Schultz I don't know how   Bernie Sanders can be on the side of   Hillary Clinton when the DNC the   Democratic National Committee run by   Hillary Clinton's person Deborah   Wasserman Schultz what they did to   Bernie Sanders was unbelievable and   now she's supporting he's supporting her   you know what I said although I think a   lot of the Bernie Sanders people are   coming to us because I'm much better and   trade than Bernie Sanders even was and   he was ok but he's supporting her and   you know Bernie Sanders could have gone   down in the record books as being a   great great man but when he made that   deal it was over now he goes and he has   crowds of a hundred people nobody wants   to watch him nobody wants to listen not   that they dislike him but he doesn't   draw anybody he doesn't draw anybody and   it's a whole different thing had he not   made that deal he would have been   legendary but once he made that deal and   then she picks a vice president who is   sort of the opposite of Bernie Sanders   didn't even pay him the respect i mean   you know one of those things and Cain   when he was governor of Virginia in the   first week he approved a tax increase of   four billion dollars in his first week   in office and he wasn't popular in   Virginia they didn't like him in   Virginia he won very close race and I   said to myself you know when she picked   him I said oh boy I hope we're not going   to lose Virginia now and we're doing   great in Virginia because nobody likes   Cain he approved a four billion dollar   tax increase in his first week but we do   like Mike Pence that I can tell you that   I can   Triple A rating Indiana Triple A rating   we're going to have a triple-a rated   country to let me tell you that we are   going to have a country that in so many   ways is

xpj1lVf6yzM~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20160908~FULL: Donald Trump AMAZING Speech in Cleveland, Ohio (September 8, 2016)~38292.0~4.69581747055~972.0~80.0~   thank you very much please sit down   thank you great honor to be with you   Cleveland terrific place we've had a   terrific relationship with Ohio and with   Cleveland so thank you all very much   school choice we're going to be talking   about it and so important just bet some   of your students and they are terrific   they have a great future they'll be   taking my job someday and I'll be happy   about it in particular though I want to   thank mr. Ron Packard where is Ron is he   here someplace yes he is thank you Ron   fantastic Jenna and Miss de Bourgh amaze   who has really done a incredible job   Deborah thank you thank you what a good   job for hosting us at this beautiful   school today we're going to discuss one   of the most important issues in this   campaign school choice but before we do   I want to briefly discuss new   revelations about Hillary Clinton's very   famous emails according to the FBI   report the FBI did not find that hostile   foreign actress and would think of this   it's so important when they went around   they went around and were so vigilant at   least as far as this but they found that   hostile foreign actors gained access to   the personal email accounts of   individuals with whom Clinton was in   regular contact and in doing so obtained   emails sent to or received by Clinton on   her personal account and every time she   talks about the subject it's different   she's got to get her act together   remember Hillary Clinton was emailing   about the drone program among many other   extremely sensitive matters this is yet   more evidence that Clinton is unfit to   be your commander-in-chief by the way   the whole country so how unfit she was   at the Town Hall last night where she   refused to take accountability for her   failed policies in the Middle East that   had produced millions of refugees   Unleashed horror of radical Islamic   terrorism all over and made us less safe   than ever before   throughout it all she put the country   and I mean the entire country at risk in   order to cover up her pay-for-play   scandals as Secretary of State   these include scandals giving up uranium   to Russia doing favors for UBS Bank and   selling contracts to friends and family   in Haiti it's all about hiding criminal   enterprise and that's what it's about as   part of our criminal cover-up Hillary's   and you know her staff you know it well   you read about it all the time you just   read about it and it's getting worse and   worse Hillary Clinton's staff deleted   and digitally bleached which is asset   cleaned her emails after receiving a   congressional subpoena   that's after receiving not before that's   after receiving she gets a subpoena from   the United States Congress and she   deletes and bleaches she also and her   staff destroyed some of her 13 different   phones but this time with a hammer I've   never done that   then when she was interviewed by the FBI   she claims she couldn't remember   important events 39 times she couldn't   even remember whether she was trained or   handling classified information didn't   remember anything about it so she really   didn't remember that's a problem and if   she did remember that's a problem she   even said she didn't know what the   letter C stood for whether was   confidential classified information or   something all the while as Hillary and   Bill raked in millions of dollars from   special interests the world was falling   apart Hillary Clinton's policies   produced ruin in Libya Iraq and Syria   absolute ruin and death she failed in   Russia she failed in China she failed   miserably in North Korea her policies   unleashed Isis spread terrorism and put   her ran on a path to nuclear weapons not   to mention the ransom payments oh those   rents and payments remember two weeks   ago it was four hundred million dollars   in cash well yesterday we found out that   in cash there was one point seven   billion dollars these are unheard of   this is cash this is in wire transfer   this isn't check this is cash 1.7   billion dollars and then you say is that   going to Tara   or is that going to people's bank   accounts I actually think it's going to   both   on top of it all Hillary Clinton is   trigger-happy totally trigger-happy   she's raised to invade intervene and   topple regimes   she believes in globalism not   Americanism everybody understands last   night she even falsely said no American   died in Libya now I heard that and I   said could she have forgotten so quickly   then she also falsely said there's no   ground troops in Iraq even though we   have 5,000 military personnel there   right now Iraq is one of the biggest   differences in this race I opposed going   in and I did oppose it despite the media   saying oh yes   no I oppose going in and I opposed the   reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out   along with President Obama   letting Isis fill that big terrible void   but I was opposed to the war from the   beginning long after my interview with   Howard Stern but three months before the   Iraq war started I said at an interview   with Neil Cavuto that perhaps we   shouldn't be doing it yet and that the   economy these are quotes that the   economy this was on live television the   economy is a much bigger problem as far   as the president is concerned this was   before the war started by a very short   distance then on March 25th of 2003 just   after the war it started just days after   just a little while after I was quoted   as saying the war is a mess and yet more   evidence that I had opposed the war from   the start I said the war is a mess on   television somewhere in July of 2003 I   said I would love to see New York City   and some of our cities and some of the   states of our nation get some of the   money   that's going toward Iraq and other   places because you know they really need   it and they need it badly well I said   that we have numerous other quotes due   by the way both before and shortly after   then in August of 2004 very early in the   conflict extremely early in the conflict   right at the beginning I made a detailed   statement in an interview to Esquire   magazine so right at the beginning   and by the way numerous honest reporters   said well Trump may have said it at the   beginning and some said he did say it at   the beginning because they had kabuto   clip and other clips but some said well   you know doesn't matter because right at   the beginning he made very strong   statements this many years ago and   here's what Esquire magazine said this   is a quote an absolute quote look at the   war in Iraq and the mess that we're in   so right after the war sir I would never   have handled it that way does anybody   really believe that Iraq is going to be   a wonderful democracy where people are   going to run down to the voting box and   gently put in their ballot and the   winner is happily going to step up and   to lead the country so innocently   I go come on two minutes after we leave   there's going to be a revolution hmm   pretty good and the meanest toughest   smartest most vicious guy will take over   well that's going to be combinations of   Isis and Iran Iran's taking over they're   taking over   among the richest and largest oil   reserves in the world we let him do it   we let him do it should have never been   in the war but we should have never ever   gotten out of the war the way Barack   Obama got us out along with Hillary   Clinton because we opened it up   for Isis so it continued what was the   purpose this is me right at the   beginning of the war in an article what   was the purpose of this whole thing what   was the purpose hundreds and hundreds of   young people are being killed and what   about the people coming back with no   arms and with no legs not to mention the   other side   all of those Iraqi kids who've been   blown to pieces and it turns out that   all of the reasons for the war are just   blatantly wrong all this for nothing all   this for nothing this was right at the   beginning of the war then they see you   know I see the lies last night Donald   Trump was always in favor of the war in   Iraq that's why I had to do this because   the media is so dishonest so terribly   the dishonest and you understand it you   understand it and you understand it the   media is so terribly dishonest so I had   to do this I ended with I would have   been tougher on terrorism bin Laden   would have been caught a long time ago   before he was ultimately caught prior to   the downing of the World Trade Center so   this was right at the beginning and   those other statements were before the   war even started and the Howard   statement was long before and was the   first time anybody ever asked me about   Iraq and he said I said my I don't know   then I was very very but that was   superseded because before the war much   closer to the war   I gave statements that we shouldn't go   in and shortly thereafter immediately   thereafter and honestly a lot of   reporters said hey right at the   beginning he made this statement and   that statement was a very major story in   Esquire magazine so I just wanted to set   the record straight there is so much   lying going on and Hillary Clinton lied   last night about numerous things   including her email but she also lied   about this had I been in Congress at the   time of the invasion   I would have cast a vote in opposition   four years I've been a critic of this   kind of reckless foreign invasions and   and look let's face it interventions   that's what they are that have been a   hallmark of trigger-happy Hilary and her   failed career spin a disaster here's the   bottom line I was a private citizen I   had no access to briefings or great   intelligence surveys that she did I had   no access to anything that's a private   citizen frankly nobody really cared too   much about what I said I'm doing   business I don't even know why I was   asked the question I guess because I was   asked the question that's who knows but   I didn't have access to access to all of   the intelligence information that she   did and everybody else did but in Iraq   my judgment was right and hers with all   of this information and all of this   great intelligence   information was wrong along with a lot   of other people in all fairness it's a   big mistake   totally destabilized the Middle East it   was a big mistake death death to so many   people Hillary Clinton is always   complaining about what's wrong I just   watched her on the tarmac she tried to   make up for her horrible performance   last night it was a horrible performance   so she went on the tarmac and told more   lies but she's been there remember this   she's always talking about things that   she's gonna do but she's been there for   more than 30 years and she's never done   anything about it never done anything   and all you have to do is look at New   York State when she ran for Senator she   said she will bring jobs back to New   York State it's a disaster   no jobs have come back jobs have left   New York State upstate New York and the   areas that she was talking about   they are disasters all you have to do is   look at New York State she said she was   gonna bring tremendous jobs back it will   be wonderful just like she's saying now   she wouldn't know how to bring a job   back she wouldn't have a clue so it's   all talk but nothing happens and that's   what's gonna happen with our country on   jobs   and nobody he's gonna bring jobs back   like Donald Trump I will be the greatest   jobs producing president that God ever   created and I say that with my pastors   in the front row my pastors believe me   so we're on track now to spend listen to   this six trillion dollars six trillion   could have rebuilt our country twice all   together on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan   and the Middle East   meanwhile massive portions of our   country are in a state of total   disrepair it's time to rebuild America   and when I say that we will also before   we get totally started we will take out   Isis remember that we have no choice   too many Americans living in our inner   cities have not been included in the   American dream we are a nation and we're   one nation when any part of our country   hurts our whole country hurts my goal as   president will be to ensure that every   child in this nation african-american   Hispanic American all Americans will be   placed on the ladder to success and I   define that as great education and a   great job the ladder rests on a   fundamental foundation we need safety   to such danger in our inner cities   there's such danger in our communities   in order to help our children succeed   our first duty is to ensure that every   kid in America can grow up in a safe   community you read what's happening you   see what's happening you can't have   prosperity without security this is the   new civil rights agenda of our time the   right to a safe community a quality   education and a wonderful job including   for those great students that I met just   a little while ago they're gonna do   great they are really doodly you've done   such a great job with the education here   our campaign represents the long-awaited   chance to break with the bitter failures   of the past and to embrace a new and   strong American future there's no failed   policy more in need of urgent change   then our government-run education   monopoly and you know in the back that's   exactly what it is they're protecting a   lot of people that have a lot of really   high-paying jobs and they're not doing   the jobs like Deborah that I can tell   you and dobara that make it a lot more   money than you but we'll have to talk   about that later   the Democratic Party has strapped   millions of African American and   Hispanic youth in failing government   schools that deny them the opportunity   to join the ladder of American success   it's time to break up that monopoly have   to do it I want every single inner-city   child in America who is today trapped in   a failing school to have the freedom the   civil right to attend the school of   their choice their parents will choose   to the finest school they will attend   that school this includes private   schools traditional public schools   magnet schools and charter schools which   must be included in any definition of   school choice our government spends more   than enough money to easily pay for this   initiative with billions and billions of   dollars to be left over it's simply a   matter of putting students first not the   education bureaucracy and that's what's   happened let's run through the numbers   at the state and federal level the   United States spends more than six   hundred and twenty billion dollars on   k-12 education each year that's an   average of about twelve thousand two   hundred and ninety six dollars for every   student enrolled in our elementary and   secondary public schools the federal   government pays for about 10 percent of   the k-12 costs the other roughly 560   billion dollars spent on k-12 education   comes from the states themselves we   spend more per student than almost any   other major country in the world and   we're doing very poorly in terms of a   list we spend more by far and we're   doing very poorly   so obviously Common Core does not work   all right our largest cities spend some   of the largest amounts of money on   public schools the biggest costs New   York City spends twenty thousand two   hundred and twenty six dollars per pupil   Baltimore spends fifteen thousand two   hundred and eighty seven dollars per   student   Chicago spends eleven thousand nine   hundred and seventy-six dollars per   student at Los Angeles it's ten thousand   six hundred and two dollars   just imagine of each student in these   school systems was given a scholarship   for this amount of money allowing them   and their family to choose the public or   private school of their choice wouldn't   that be great not only with this empower   families but it would create a massive   education market that is competitive and   produces better outcomes and I mean far   better outcomes these schools would then   cater to the needs of the individual   student and family not the needs choose   a disadvantaged children and the success   of these schools will be a top priority   in a trump administration we have to fix   education we have to military education   health care but these things all go hand   in hand we have to fix my first budget   will immediately add an additional   federal investment of 20 billion dollars   toward school choice this will be done   by reprioritizing existing federal   dollars we have to reprioritize   specifically my plan will use twenty   billion dollars of existing federal   dollars to establish a block grant for   the 11 million school-age kids living in   absolute poverty we will give States the   option to allow these funds to far   the student to the public or private   school they attend the parents will be   so happy   number one will have safe streets and   number two they'll walk their child to a   school that they want to be how about   that   how is that what a difference what a   difference compared that to today where   you just people say how do you do it how   do you do it   distribution of this grand will favor   states that have private school choice   and charter laws encouraging them to   participate they're going to be   encouraged to participate this twenty   billion dollars will instantly extend   choice to millions and millions more   students a state like Ohio will benefit   greatly from these new funds Ohio is a   leader in school choice Ohio has five   private school choice programs that   serve over 30,000 students and 384   charter schools serving one hundred and   twenty three thousand eight hundred and   forty four students great job but the   twenty billion dollars is only the   beginning as president I will establish   the national goal of providing school   choice to every American child living in   poverty that means that we want every   disadvantaged child to be able to choose   the local public private or charter   school a magnet school any of these   schools that is best for them and for   their family for mom and dad each state   will develop its own formula but we want   the dollars to follow the student so   important that dollars will follow the   student and the student will follow in   the right school they're going to follow   the right school nine and ten dollars   spent on k-12 education is spent at the   state and local level to achieve this   long-term goal we will have to make this   a   shared national mission to bring hope to   every child in every city in this land   in our country in our great country I   will use the pulpit of the presidency to   campaign for this in all 50 states and I   will call upon the American people to   elect officials at the city state and   federal level who support school choice   so important my administration will   partner with the leadership of inner   city and I mean any one of them any one   of them any inner city in America   Chicago Baltimore Detroit Cleveland we   love Cleveland we got a great experience   in Cleveland that's all I know and by   the way your Police Department did a   phenomenal job and that's any city that   is willing to run a pilot program to   provide school choice to every child in   that community in Baltimore for instance   that would mean more than $15,000 in   funds available per student can't beat   that   I'm confident that the politicians will   not be able to suppress the will of the   people anymore it's too much too strong   eventually they break the politicians   always break they certainly break on   trade for our country we don't make any   good deals right they break on an hourly   basis if we can put a man on the moon   dig out the Panama Canal and win two   world wars that I have no doubt that we   as a nation can provide school choice to   every disadvantaged child in America if   the states collectively contribute   another 110 billion dollars of their own   education budgets towards school choice   on top of the 20 billion in federal   dollars that could provide $12,000 in   school choice funds to every single k12   student who today is living in poverty   the money will follow the student that   means the student will be able to attend   the public private charter or magnet   school of their choice and each state   will develop its own system that works   best for them they're going to develop   systems the likes of which you've never   seen and some states will do better than   others and then you're going to get   those people to come to your state and   then other things will be happening   it'll be so exciting and it's not really   a question of the money because we'll be   saving money and having a far better   education as your president I will be   the nation's biggest cheerleader for   school choice I understand many stale   old politicians will resist a lot of   pressure they've got a lot of pressure   on them but it's time for our country to   start thinking big and correct   once again we spend too much time   quibbling over the smallest words when   we should spend our time dreaming about   the great adventures that lie ahead   I will also support merit pay for   teachers the great teachers so that we   reward our best teachers instead of the   failed tenure system that rewards bad   teachers and punishes the good ones and   the bad ones are making the same money   and sometimes more than the good ones   can have that at the same time we have   to ensure that jobs are waiting for our   young kids when they graduate high   school and college my policy will   admissions of new jobs through our   country especially for african-american   and Hispanic communities I'm gonna do   such a great job my plan to lift   restriction   when the production of American energy   will not only make home energy bills a   lot cheaper your electric bills will be   a lot less but we'll add an estimated   half a million jobs per year by reducing   radical regulations and over taxation   we're bringing you taxes way down we can   bring thousands of new companies into   our poorest communities crucially my   trade reforms will create a   manufacturing revival in America as you   know all of your companies Cleveland is   a great example but your companies are   being ripped out of your community and   your people are being left jobless and   your governments being left with no   taxes we have a nearly eight hundred   billion dollar think of that 800 billion   dollar annual trade deficit with the   world we trade with the world we have a   trade deficit of eight hundred billion   dollars who is negotiating these deals   who's doing it that's actually very good   Hillary Clinton is absolutely a good   answer   Hillary Clinton and people like Hillary   Clinton that haven't got a clue and the   clue they do have goes to their donors   and the special interest believe me   that's money coming straight out of the   states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and   Michigan and Maine and so many others   I've seen so many it's so sad when I   campaigned during the primaries   I saw everything and it was so sad to   see communities that have just been left   jobless where the companies have moved   to other countries Mexico in particular   but other countries by ending foreign   currency manipulation product dumping   and other predatory trading practices we   will be able to open thousands of new   plants and factories across America in   driving over today I passed so many   places factories 20 30 years ago they   were thriving and they just dead   worthless a real estate person you   wouldn't pay anything worthless   we'll put them back into action again   the future is filled with limitless   possibilities for a nation and exciting   opportunities for a wonderful children   we all have to do and we just have to   work we all have to work but we all have   to cut our ties with the failed politics   of the past you have to cut your ties   have to cut your ties these are the   people that put us in this situation   they're not gonna take us out they're   not gonna take us out that includes in   wars and Hillary Clinton created a lot   of the problems and now she's saying how   she's gonna take us out she doesn't have   a clue not even a little clue we've had   such a failed foreign policy with the   people we have now they failed education   policy a totally failed economic policy   and underneath it all   a failed political system that rewards   politicians for how many donors they   have or how many journalists they know   not how many Americans they help to live   better and more prosperous lives that's   how they get rewarded they'll talk to   you and talk to you they'll come into   Cleveland she'll be saying what a   wonderful job she's gonna do she'll get   your vote then she'll say see in four   years she might even say see in four   years suckers because that's what it is   see and for your suckers but the   failures of the past are about to end   that ending begins on a very special   date for this country November 8th get   out and vote we will have one American   nation   we will be one American people we're   fighting to give every child in every   forgotten stretch of this country the   chance to live out their dreams in   safety and in peace   that means a safe neighborhood a quality   education and they secure high paying   and exciting job we only have bad jobs   we don't have good jobs anymore many of   our good jobs have left their God this   is how we will rebuild our future this   is how we will make America great again   for everyone god bless you thank you   very much thank you thank you very much   appreciate it   [Music]

extended did you hear about   this through tomorrow so register you   gotta go and register or we we've really   you know we're doing something that's   incredible it's a movement but if we   don't

absentee ballot today and vote really   early we've got to win the Hillary   Clinton documents released today by   WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just   how much is at stake in this election so   much corruption this election will   determine whether we remain a free   country in the truest sense of the word   or we become a corrupt Banana Republic   controlled by large donors and foreign   governments the election of Hillary   Clinton would lead to the destruction of   our country believe me it will lead to   the destruction of our country today we   learned amazingly that the Department of   Justice fed information to the Clinton   campaign about the email investigation   so that the campaign could be prepared   to cover up her crimes what is going on   Rudy Giuliani said it this is collusion   and corruption of the highest order and   is one more reason why I asked my   attorney general I will ask to appoint a   special prosecutor   we have to investigate Hillary Clinton   and we have to investigate the   investigation this was a disgrace this   was a disgrace Hillary bleached and   deleted 33,000 emails after   congressional subpoenas can you imagine   that they got a subpoena from the United   States Congress and then they deleted   everything if you did that in private   life you go to jail and then destroyed   her phones some with a hammer boom   anybody destroy your phones before with   a hammer anybody know anybody know and   people have gone to jail for doing far   less she also lost think of this she was   Secretary of State lost as much as six   billion dollars in taxpayer money while   she was running secretary of state now   some people say it was misplaced Oh   billions of dollars misplaced these   wikileaks emails confirm what those of   us here today have known all along   Hillary Clinton is the vessel a corrupt   global establishment that's raiding our   country and surrendering the sovereignty   of our nation this criminal government   cartel doesn't recognize borders but   believes in global governance unlimited   immigration and ruled by corporations it   also believes in no borders just come on   folks come on in speaking in secret to a   foreign bank again just revealed Hillary   Clinton said my dream is a hemispheric   common market with open trade and open   borders will there go the rusty of   businesses and there goes your country   folks she doesn't say that behind closed   doors when she thought no one was   listening she pledged to dissolve the   borders of the United States of America   no borders you don't have borders we   don't have a country   WikiLeaks has given us a window into the   secret Carter's of government power   where we see a former Secretary of State   announcing her desire to end forever the   American independence that our founders   gave to us and wanted us to have   American soldiers have fought and died   to win and keep America's freedom and   now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender   that freedom to these open borders open   trade and a world government and by the   way we want a government for the United   States we're very happy with it we're   very happy crooked Hillary is so radical   and immigration that as Secretary of   State she refused to make foreign   countries take back their criminal   aliens we have mall over the place she   didn't want to bring him back they'd   bring him back the countries were smart   they say we don't want him would say   okay we'll take him and then you look at   the crime and you wonder why and by the   way do you know it was just announced   that murder is the highest it's been in   our country in 45 years you've heard   that right one such killer who was set   free on Hillary's watch went to a jail   came out and went on to kill a beautiful   young American girl named Casey Chadwick   people have heard that name beautiful   wonderful person the killer who had   already been convicted for shooting a   girl in the head should have been sent   home instead he was set free and stabbed   Casey in the face and neck 15 times   violently and stuffed her body in a   closet the corrupt establishment in   Washington wants to surrender America's   borders even as they send our troops   overseas to protect the borders of   foreign countries were protecting the   borders of foreign countries but not our   borders a trump administration will   secure control defend and protect the   borders of the United States   we are going to protect and the Border   Patrol agents just gave us as you know   their endorsement never did it before   ice just gave us their endorsement   sheriff joe from arizona just gave us   his advice even Chelsea Clinton the   WikiLeaks email show expressed serious   concerns about conflicts of interest at   the Clinton Foundation and the State   Department during a recent trip to   Florida I had a chance to spend some   time with the incredible residence of   Little Haiti the Haitian community has   contributed so much to this country and   to this state I also learned from them   firsthand how much they despised the   Clintons for what they did to the people   of haiti new emails revealed today by   ABC News show that during the deadly   earthquake in Haiti which killed over   150,000 people at least the Clintons   couldn't stop cashing in as people were   dying in Haiti Clinton insiders were   separating out requests from friends of   bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs   so that their business interests or   contracts would receive very special   treatment people who were labeled not   friends of bill were placed very much on   the sidelines in their biggest project   the Clintons used four hundred million   dollars in aid and US taxpayer funds to   build what amounted to a massive   sweatshop and guess who set it up Cheryl   Mills Hillary's chief of staff who   helped destroy her emails and then got   immunity from the FBI that included the   destruction of her computer   never been anything folks there's never   been anything like this there's never   been what's gone on here with the email   destruction with the deletion of   thousands and thousands and last week it   was revealed that two boxes of emails   and information were missing they were   missing their God the company that   benefited from Mills actions then   invented in a company they put a lot of   money in a company owned by Cheryl Mills   they invested today as Hades death toll   from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise we   should never forget how Bill and Hillary   Clinton handled Haiti the last time out   to all of our friends in Haiti and to   all of our friends in Little Haiti who   are so amazing your day of justice is   coming and it arrives on november eighth   we've got to do this gotta go we've got   to do it not only have the Clintons   ripped off Haiti but the new emails show   members of the Clinton team attacking   Catholics while this is offensive it's   just the latest evidence of the hatred   that the Clinton campaign has really for   everyday Americans and you see it and   you see so much from these wikileaks you   see so much this so much we've all read   the reports and heard the stories about   how disrespectfully she treats law   enforcement you've seen it how   disrespectful she is to the Secret   Service and many others in uniform even   there to protect her and by the way   these are weapon carrying people they   carry weapons Hillary Clinton wants to   really dismantle our Second Amendment   you know so maybe she should start with   her security people not carrying weapons   does that make sense to you   maybe maybe she should she even smeared   all of America's police officers as   essentially racist you heard that   recently essentially racist and by the   way I want to give a shout-out and   salute to our great people of law   enforcement our police have done an   amazing job I'm proud of the fact that   I've always treated the working people   of this country with dignity and respect   especially our military and law   enforcement personnel these are amazing   people the WikiLeaks emails show that   Hillary staff even has given up secret   notes on when she needs to smile it's   all a phony deal with her by the way did   everybody see the debate right gotten   good reviews good reviews gotten good   reviews we'll see what happens but Pat   Buchanan said the greatest of any   presidential debate the greatest   performance thank you very much folks   like you and we had eight online polls   and every one of those it's time   magazine and Drudge and so many others   and every one of them said we won by a   massive Marchant so let's hope it all   boils down let's hope it all boils down   to winning on november eighth otherwise   honestly i've wasted my time you've   wasted your time I will have spent over   100 million dollars on running for   office a lot of money a lot of money   that's not the thing if I don't win it   will be the single greatest waste of   time energy and money and you know   somebody told me recently a pundit said   doesn't matter whether you want to lose   what we've done all of us what we've   done but what I've done has never been   duplicated there's never been anything   like this in American history you look   at our crowds I mean Bernie Sanders was   second his crowds are tiny did you see   him   written today she had this little crowd   and they say always the biggest crowd   she had nothing she had nothing and they   start talking on television because the   media is rigged let me tell you the best   thing she's got going my opinion the   only thing she's got going is the rigged   media that she's got nothing going can   you imagine working with her for four   more years the last thing we need the   last thing we need is another four years   of Barack Obama we don't need that   believe me that's what we're going to   get did we get her but the emails also   show yet again that the DNC Democratic   National Committee rigged the democratic   election the primary process to take it   away from birdie and give it to Hillary   Clinton the DNC vice chair was caught   feeding information about Bernie Sanders   plans to the Clinton campaign that's   supposed to do that supposed to be you   know if I was Bernie I wouldn't be too   happy after watching what came out today   and WikiLeaks a Bernie was used and in   all fairness Bernie made a deal with the   devil and he made a big mistake he could   have gone down as something very   important in American history when he   made that deal he sold out he sold out   and very very bad but to all the Bernie   voters out there don't vote for a Wall   Street sellout like Hillary Clinton and   you remember this the one thing I had in   mind and one thing we had in common with   crooked Hillary was borders the borders   are much stronger that's why I have all   the endorsements from everybody on the   borders but Bernie knew that we were   getting ripped off on trade and he was   right except my numbers are much   different we're going to redo it we're   going to have unbelievable trade deals   we're going to make unbelievable deals   but to the bernese to the Bernie Sanders   people you get sold out   but remember this I'm much stronger on   trade so much stronger on trade that   Bernie and trade was a big deal because   he was right we are getting sold out our   jobs are being lost our jobs are being   taken we're being sold out a vote for   Hillary is a vote for more reckless   foreign invasions more Wall Street   cheating more terrible trade deals and   as confirmed yesterday by WikiLeaks   Hillary also wants to cut Medicare and   Social Security she wants to do that a   vote for Trump is a vote for America   first and as a vote to protect Medicare   and Social Security believe me we're   going to protect our Medicare we're   going to protect our social security   she's not gonna do it she's also going   to raise your taxes big league folks   that we're going to lower your taxes   minor minor thing but just remember it   WikiLeaks also shows something I've been   warning every of everybody everybody   about for a long time the media is   simply an extension of Hillary Clinton's   campaign it's just one more way that the   system is rigged a big way really a big   way reporters who work for these outlets   like The Washington Post or the New York   Times may think of themselves as   journalists but they're actually just   cogs in a corporate political machine   the dishonesty of the New York Times is   unbelievable the dishonesty of the   Washington Post is unbelievable the   dishonesty of all of those cameras so   many of them not all of them is   unbelievable the emails show the New   York Times The Boston Globe Univision a   third-rate reporter named John Harwood   what a third-rate reporter that one is   they remember he did the debate and made   a total fool of himself he's of CNBC all   doing favors for the Clinton   and reporters smothering the Clintons   with praise why why you saw Hillary on   the debate stage do you think do you   think that's really worthy do you really   think that's worthy folks do you think   that's what this country is all about   the new york times even gave clinton   veto power over her quotes in a major   story i've never heard about that i'd   like to have veto power when they   misquote me all the time it's actually   corruption the emails also show that   hillary was given the CNN Town Hall   questions before her big debate against   Bernie Sanders is that possible donna   Brazile the DNC vice chair email from   time to time I get questions in advance   she said oh that's fair how do you think   that's fair to Bernie I'm starting fear   they really aren't we starting to feel   sorry for Bernie Sanders like a little   bit right the media can't report on the   establishment because the media largely   is the establishment and the corrupt   media is teamed up against you the   American people and I used to get great   press until I said I'm running then they   said he's running we don't want him to   run but I used to get great who got   better press than me I got great press a   lot of press my wife said the other day   used to get such great press now every   single story is a slant and I'll tell   you what it's libelous and slanderous   it's horrible and it's really unfair but   we're going to beat the system we're   going to beat the system we're going to   break up the failed establishment and   the chronic corruption and create a new   and bright American future I didn't need   to do this folks I didn't need to do   this but we have to do it and we have   the greatest people on earth the the   people of our country these are the   greatest people on earth   to know so many our veterans are so   incredible they're not being taken care   of our military our police we have the   greatest people on earth Hillary Clinton   the candidate of the past today dredged   up Al Gore did you see him anybody see   him did he say was the founder of the   internet he wasn't to campaign with her   in Florida al gore wants to eliminate   the combustion engine essentially and   flies around the world on jets and   pushes plans that would help create   China make it stronger they make so much   of our product they make so much they   make so many of our big windmills and   you know when they're making them that   steel and all of that stuff that they   talk about going up into the air but   it's got to go up into the air maybe we   should be making them instead of China   Germany and other places the   obama-clinton TPA spend billions on   failed climate projects instead of   repairing water infrastructure in cities   like flint remember Flint what a shame   my administration will address important   environmental priorities like the   Everglades and it's your quality water   all across America including the fixing   of water problems like Lake Okeechobee   it's amazing you know Lake Okeechobee   they're always letting the water out   gibbehh notice we always have droughts   they're always letting the water out I   said keep it in we won't have so many   Krauts we won't have any droughts but   Lake Okeechobee and you know a lot of   things have happened Hillary has   received millions of dollars from donors   who want to shut down American energy   all together radical activists like Tom   Steyer have promised to spend more than   70 million dollars this election to get   Clinton and Democrats like are elected   in return Clinton wants to shut down   energy production all across the United   States what you see your energy bills   we're going to put the miners and the   steelworkers of our country back to work   do it Hillary Clinton and Al Gore   support the Paris deal which will cost   america over five trillion dollars and   cause Florida electricity rates to   skyrocket over the years skyrocket think   of it we're going to spend five trillion   dumbs and you know it's going to happen   we're going to become non competitive   with other countries other countries are   eating our lunch right now they're   eating our lunch we're going to become   non-competitive the Paris deal also   allows China the world's largest   polluter by far to increase emissions   for more than a dozen years while the   United States makes drastic cuts   immediately right now what's that all   about why are we doing it together   what's that about who negotiates our   deals it's one more way the Clintons   have surrendered American prosperity to   China and so many other countries we are   led by people that are grossly   incompetent folks they grossly   incompetent how about the 400 million in   cash that they gave a rand that turned   out to be one point seven billion   you know what 1.7 billion is it's like   this stage loaded up with money nobody   has ever seen it can you imagine these   people on Iran when they see the money   they say can you believe this boy did we   hit the jackpot three years ago before   we made them rich they would die as a   country they were ready to go but we   made them rich we made him rich how   about the 800 people ready for   deportation remember two weeks ago ready   for deportation they made a mistake they   all became United States citizens right   and these were people that were not   exactly too good that's why they were   being deported but the 800 turned out to   be wrong somebody actually said Trump   was wrong in the number i said oh man   here we go was it 400 was it 799 no it   was one I guess was what 17 1800 it   turned out so much more than the eighth   they said I was wrong because I was low   and the whole thing is crazy so I said   you know what that's okay just reverse   the proj you know get him you can deport   him they said that wouldn't be   constitutional hey folks don't we're   being led by stupid people we're being   led by stupid people and Hillary Clinton   will be worse than Obama if I'm elected   president we are going to start winning   again we don't win anymore the WikiLeaks   peaches even show Clinton praising the   president of China for promising to   assert his authority my energy proposals   will unlock the 50 trillion dollars in   energy reserves right here in America   this means new jobs in florida not new   jobs in china we're going to make   America first folks America first   it's all part of our plan to make   America rich again but to make America   rich again we also have to repeal and   replace the disaster known as Obamacare   bill clinton in a rare moment of truth   telling said Obamacare was a crazy   system where people wind up with their   premiums doubled and their coverage   cutting head now on this he was right   right on this to you was right we got to   give him credit oh boy did he suffer   that night can you imagine that was last   week he suffered gravely when he went   home I EI EI the next day he came in he   said the event other sort of i'm only   kidding i'm only kidding bring memories   are going to surge next year here in   florida beyond what you've ever seen   before and all across the country i just   left texas great state they're gone up   sixty percent through bluecross   blueshield sixty percent and remember   this the election on november eighth   they're trying to announce many of these   massive increases after the election   don't let it happen you're going to have   hundred percent increases you're going   to have ninety five percent increases   but you've already got sixty-eight   percent seventy-two percent insurers are   fleeing patients are losing their   doctors remember you can keep your   doctor you can keep your plan 28 times   obama said that he lied and the best   students don't want to be doctors   anymore they used to want to be doctors   doctors have more accountants working   for him now than they have nurses it's   so complicated it's a giant mess a giant   catastrophe that will destroy American   health care for good if we don't get rid   of it and this election is going to be   so pivotal in terms of your health care   in terms of costs for health care so   remember you're going to get great   health care at a far far reduced course   you're going to be much less expensive   this Obamacare is a nightmare   it is a nightmare and by the way Hillary   Clinton wants to go to a single-payer   the government's going to take care of   your everything it's going to cost so   much money you know in Canada where they   have a better version that what she's   for talking about when people with some   money want an operation they come into   the United States to get it it's slow it   doesn't work doesn't work anywhere we   have concepts that is so good in fact   concepts that are so good that they'll   only get better so much less money so we   have to repeal and replace Obamacare   it's killing the country and it's   killing the people that have to pay for   it both of it but you have to get out   we're going to do it and you have to   vote we're going to replace Obamacare   with health savings accounts so you can   choose the private doctor that you want   at the center of our economic revival   will be fixing our terrible terrible   trados if you remember on june sixteenth   of last year that is when i said we're   going to run you know it takes a lot of   guts and courage to do this i started   off there were 17 people great people   all nice people some didn't you know   honor their pledge but these are minor   details right but we had some great   people many of whom are supporting us   dr. ben Carson we have great guy great   guy good man chris Christie mean we have   incredible support mike huckabee he's   been so great on television he's so good   he's so good he said the other night   Donald Trump won that debate by a   landslide but that doesn't mean the   press is going to report that they all   reported Trump won but Mike Huckabee   said it better he said Trump want it   easy not even a contest but that doesn't   mean that the CNN's of the world will   say that okay they won't never say it   they will never say if the late great   Abraham Lincoln debated and he was   representing our point of view CNN would   say Abe Lincoln went down to a mess of   defeat   I mean these are dishonest people were   dealing with these are very very   dishonest people and it's really a shame   and their ratings are not very good   either that's good you know why because   some people they lose credibility New   York Times is losing credibility   remember they wrote the story about   Trump with women was on the front page   of the New York Times that I was a   little bit lewd lewd but they had the   story few months ago with women and they   put in the front page in here comes and   then the women called and said I didn't   say that I like him a lot he's a great   guy you know from 30 years ago and 20   years ago and 15 years ago and I was so   honored that they had the courage to do   it but the times never gave me a thank   you know any kind of a retraction it's a   disgrace what's going on with the media   is disgraceful and it's happening to all   of us believe me it's happening to all   of us 47 million Americans are living in   poverty and 45 million Americans are in   food stamps this is the legacy of Obama   Clinton my economic reforms on energy   taxes regulations and trade will create   at least 25 million new jobs over the   next 10 years it's going to be   unbelievable I will be the greatest jobs   president that God ever created believe   me   the state of Florida's lost one in four   manufacturing job since NAFTA and China   deals happened thank you love you too   darling it's good I love Florida I love   the people of flour I've created many   many jobs in florida many many jobs you   have jobs on Miami Beach doral is a   tremendous success and Maura Lago and   the clubs and we've done all of that   he'll he's done nothing for Florida so   and remember when we were in the primary   I ran against Marco Jeb all these guys   and we had a great hey look Marco has   been very very nice lately and I hope he   wins I do but we won by 21 points   remember that everyone said what   happened how about all of these sites   you know I went into a couple of states   Trump was one point down does it look   like and then we win by like 14 points   we could have this happen we're pretty   even in florida and i'm a little   disappointed because hillary hasn't   created a job and I've created thousands   of jobs in florida thousands in at Doral   I have over a thousand people working   just at Doral itself mar-a-lago Trump   International many many jobs buildings   along the beach in Miami now we've   created a lot of jobs so flora doesn't   if you guys don't vote me as a victor   i'm going to be very angry at you Hilary   doesn't come down to Florida she comes   down to Florida to try and get you vote   than you won't see her anymore if   Hillary Clinton gets in the   manufacturing that's left in Florida   Ohio North Carolina Pennsylvania   Michigan will be shipped to other   countries shipped overseas and go to   Mexico look there's no doubt about that   if I win day one we're going to announce   our plans to totally renegotiate NAFTA   which is a one-way street for businesses   to leave our country   they get the businesses they get the   cash and you know we get we get the   drugs that's what we get we get nothing   we get unemployment and we get drugs the   years of all talk no action politicians   like her will end I'm not controlled by   special interest so i'll immediately   begin to go to work on this that's why   I'm putting up my own money for the most   part other than we're getting massive   amounts of small contributions average   61 dollars you saw the numbers in fact   they're going to be announced tomorrow   set records for a Republican on the   small contributions I love that I love   that and we're doing good we just came   out with a new commercial and crooked   Hillary she's crooked as a three-dollar   bill I used to say a two-dollar bill but   now they make two-dollar bills if we   don't get the deal we want on NAFTA   remember this remember I said it we will   leave NAFTA and start over again and   make a much better deal okay we will   terminate a trump administration will   also stand up to China's product dumping   and currency cheating and the steel what   they're doing to our steel companies is   unbelievable with the dumping we're   going to start making things again in   America we're going to have apple make   their iPhones and make things in this   country not make everything in China and   Vietnam and these other countries   we're going to bring apple and many   other companies they're going to be back   in the United States our jobs we're   going with much lower business taxes   we're bringing the tax rate from thirty   five percent to fifteen percent and we   are going to be booming again our taxes   are so high our taxes are so high that   businesses are forced to leave and by   the way when businesses want to be   ripped out of Florida ripped out of your   community not going to happen anymore   because there's going to be consequences   like carrier air conditioning in the   state of Indiana where Mike Pence by the   way is doing a great job for me do we   like Mike okay so Mike did a great job   he absolutely beat Tim Kaine who who you   know Tim Kaine raised taxes in his first   week when he was governor of Virginia   not a popular governor he raised him by   four billion dollars Mike on the other   hand Indiana you take a look I mean he   has done such a great job so here's my   question to you by cheering who did   better in the debate are you ready for   your gonna give you go to cheer you let   me know so I did very well did you see   Hillary today did everybody see the   debate yeah you lost but killed I look   forward next week we have another one I   look forward hey did you see wait wait   wait did you see where she said that I   entered her space so here's i am i'm   standing right you saw that this is a   liar so i'm standing at my podium I've   got my chair and crooked Hillary walks   across the stage right in front of him   I'm standing I didn't move right right   so I'm standing and she walks across the   stage he's standing right in front of me   I didn't care I didn't care and she's   answering a question and then she walks   right back okay that's fine I didn't   make a big deal next day I said I read   the paper   you entered my space she entered my   space right but did you see did you see   what she said that I entered her space I   didn't move and I was very careful   because years ago somebody did come in   and talk to her and the poor guy lazio   he got just killed so I said I'm not   getting near this woman no I'm not   getting near this woman at all no   interest no interest I have no interest   but resaw that right so I'm standing   there she walks she stands right next to   me and the next day they said Donald   Trump entered her space these are   dishonest people anyway but next week we   have another debate in Las Vegas so   that'll be America if I get elected will   become when when they always go when   went by like that you know kind of leave   you you don't want to sound too   egotistical the polls are pretty even in   Florida you don't let me down don't let   me down honestly don't let yourselves   down maybe more importantly America will   become the great jobs magnet of the   world remember them we're also going to   fix our inner cities and help our Latino   Americans and believe me that's what we   have to do the Hispanics in this country   have been treated very unfairly the   African Americans have been treated very   very unfairly forty five percent of   african-american youth live in poverty   fifty-eight percent of african-american   youth don't have jobs only forty-one   percent on their own home that's much   much lower than other groups forty-one   percent that's a very low number one of   the lowest more than 3,000 people have   been shot in Chicago since January first   three thousand people so the inner   cities   don't have jobs have a lousy education   right have lousy horrible and they're   unsafe you get shot walking to the store   so I say to the African Americans   suffering in our inner cities what do   you have to lose vote for Donald Trump   what do you have to lose I will fix it I   will do the job and in four years from   now when we have another election I will   win with african-americans and I will   win with Hispanics in very large numbers   we're going to fix it these politicians   have been lying to you for years these   Democrats they've run the inner cities   for up to a hundred years even more   uninterruptedly come for your vote every   four years Hillary Clinton comes for   your vote and you'll get a vote and then   after you get the votes you'll say bye   bye I'll see you in for you she hasn't   do anything she didn't do anything for   New York State remember upstate New York   a disaster she came out and she said an   upstate New York she's going to create   200,000 jobs guess what everybody left   it was like a disaster she was a   disaster and she's a bad person remember   that she's a bad bad person I will fight   harder for you than anyone ever has   fought before and that's why I want to   get the african-american vote and I want   to get the Hispanic vote we're going to   fix your communities we're going to fix   those inner cities for once and for all   we're going to fix them and we're going   to create jobs and great education and   we're going to have safe inner cities   instead of these horrible horrible death   traps and that's what they are   we're going to fight for the Latinos   trapped in poverty that includes school   choice for every low-income   african-american and Latino Hispanic   child in this nation disadvantaged   children will be able to send their kids   to the public private charter or magnet   school of their choice i also have a   message for our wonderful cuban-american   community where any Cubans here Cuban   Cuban America not too many but I'll say   it anyway all right Obama made a   one-sided deal with the Castro regime by   executive order everything's executive   order because he doesn't have enough   time because he's playing so much golf   he doesn't have enough time to convince   Congress to do it this guy plays more   golf than people on the PGA Tour we will   cancel the Obama order unless we get the   deal that we want including political   and religious freedom for the people of   Cuba we will also stand with our friends   in Venezuela as they struggle for   freedom and Doral is located in a big   community where we have tremendous   numbers of people from Venezuela amazing   people the people of Venezuela and Cuba   know how dangerous corruption is and how   dangers socialism is two more reasons   why we have to keep crooked Hillary   Clinton out of the White House here are   some more amazing things as we finish up   that we're going to do for our country   starting in 2017 would right around the   corner we are going to massively cut   taxes and regulations she is going to   increase taxes substantially we're going   to protect Internet freedom you see   where they want to sell now they want to   have the internet run by the world all   right did you see what Obama wants to do   oh I hope we can stop that deal fast did   you see that wants to give up that   tremendous right we're going to defend   religious liberty   we're going to safeguard a very obsolete   electrical grid from cyberattacks   cyberattack is a new big problem we're   going to rebuild our depleted military   and we are going to take care of our   great veterans we have tremendous   veteran support tremendous veteran   support we're going to construct a

you too I love you too I   love you too as you heard earlier today   the FBI after discovering new email   [Applause]   is reopening their investigation into   Hillary Clinton   [Applause]   the investigation is the biggest   political scandal since Watergate and   it's everybody's hope that justice at   last can be delivered in a very brief   remarks tonight Hillary Clinton tried to   politicize this investigation by   attacking and falsely accusing the FBI   director of only sending the letter to   Republicans another Clinton lie as it   turned out the letter was sent to both   Republican and Democratic leaders in   Congress the FBI would never have   reopened this case at this time unless   it were a most egregious criminal   offense   as you know I've had but in your words   about the FBI lately but I give them   great credit for having the courage to   write this horrible wrong justice will   prevail prior to today's events i was   going to start off this speech by   talking about how great we've been doing   in the polls we've been running an issue   based campaign focus on change   accountability and of course repealing   and replacing obamacare   [Applause]   we're campaigning all over the country   with a plan to bring back our jobs and   provide safety for our families in   recent days Remington Paul's which is   highly respected showed us searching for   points ahead in Ohio going three points   ahead in North Carolina we're up   according to Bloomberg at least two   points in Florida and by the way the   people standing on lines in Florida and   so many other places are unbelievable   early voting States and a lot of them   have red hats to have white hats they   have pins they have shirts that happen   to say make America great again and for   the most part these are people that are   voting for Trump right for the most   when they have the whole deal and plenty   of buttons we've got their vote but the   lines have been incredible all over the   country we pulled thank you we pulled   ahead nationally in numerous balls and   this was all before this recent disaster   for her but justice for the country okay   we had gaps but we are really moving and   I just wanted to say that because I   don't know what's going to happen now   and by the way speaking of Iowa and   speaking of poles the Des Moines   Register not my favorite paper pads us   up four points you know   [Applause]   in 11 days we are going to win the state   of Iowa and we are going to win back the   white early voting is underway so make   sure you get out and vote it's a   movement like nobody has ever seen   before in this country you must get out   and vote we're going to take back the   White House we're going to bring common   sense to government we're going to bring   honesty to government get out and vote   thank you so much is at stake in this   election when we win in November we are   going to have honest government once   again Hillary Clinton destroyed   thirty-three thousand emails destroyed   13 iPhones two boxes of email evidence   went mysteriously missing maybe now   they'll be able to find it she put her   office up for sale to large corporations   donors and foreign powers those same   special interests are now spending   millions on her campaign in an effort to   keep their corrupt grip on power and I   have to tell you I was in Florida a   couple of days ago and they say it's 50   to one adds 50 to one now is the   beautiful 50 to 1 all of that wall   street money going to help crooked   Hillary and we're leading how are you   leaving when it's 50 to one   [Applause]   and boy am i spending a lot of my money   and I oh wow dan gable would say you   shouldn't be spending that much mr.   truck but he knows about winning more   than anybody and i'll tell you what we   are going to win we are going to win and   we're going to return power to the   people you know i was on the other side   and I understand the other side probably   as well as anybody but I love our   country I really love our country and I   saw what was happening and I had to do   this and on june sixteenth of last year   when i announced coming down the   escalator with melania i announced i   want to tell you it was one of the great   honors of my life because we are going   to start winning again our country is   going to start being smart again we're   not going to let our jobs disappear   we're going to be the smart country once   again the smart country   [Applause]   we have as a movement like they've never   seen before a once-in-a-lifetime chance   to clean up Washington to bring fairness   and growth back to our economy and to   stop wasting trillions and trillions of   dollars in misguided wars and adventures   overseas and we never win we never win   real change begins with immediately   repealing and replacing the disaster   known as Obamacare it's just been   announced that Americans are going to   experience another massive double-digit   Ike double-digit these hikes and by the   way they were announced by the White   House and they said twenty-five percent   which is terrible but the real numbers   double that the real number is much more   than that as an example the great state   of Arizona will have a one hundred and   sixteen percent increase in premiums   even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is   quote the craziest thing in the world   where people wind up with their premiums   doubled and their coverage cut in half   in Minnesota where premiums increase   will be probably more than sixty percent   the Democratic governor said the   Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable horrible never worked I said   it before they approved it remember how   many times that President Obama say you   can have your doctor you can keep your   plan you can keep your doctor over and   over 28 times and a lot of people   including Democrats voted for it because   they believed him but it was a lie   Jonathan Gruber the architect of   Obamacare remember remember that name   from a year and a half ago remember that   name people forget but I don't forget   admitted it was all a fraud he said it   was passed because of the stupidity of   the American voter do you remember that   guy but the only stupidity was that the   officials who ran this through over the   objections of the America voter this is   what happened did it tremendous the   service to our country job-killing   Obamacare is just one more way the   system is rigged and I've been saying it   for a long time but you know what what   happened today starting with the FBI   maybe the system will become a little   less rig beautiful   Hillary Clinton wants to double down an   Obamacare making it even more expensive   she also wants to put illegal immigrants   on Obamacare further collapsing our   health care system in this country   repealing and replacing Obamacare is one   of the single most important reasons we   must win on november eighth by the way   who has voted so far raise your hands   well it's not great who is going to vote   all right good that's good we're going   to do great special place special people   special place will change also means   getting rid of the corruption in   Washington my contract with the American   voter begins with a plan to take our   government back from the donors and a   special interests I used to be a donor I   used to be a special interest now I'm   very much an outsider and maybe the old   time I might I might just be the   all-time outsider the day I didn't have   one day I was at insider and then boom   my boy was iron outside but I knew what   had to be done I want the entire corrupt   Washington establishment to hear us   immediately when we say when we win on   november eighth we are going to   Washington DC and we are going to drain   the swamp drain the swamp   we're going to drain the swamp   by the way they just told me this is a   record-setting crowd for this place not   bad   [Applause]   and I don't have a guitar I don't have   an instrument so that makes it even   better at the core of my contract is my   plan to bring back our jobs right now 70   million American women and children live   in abject poverty or something I mean   what's happening in this country this is   the United States of America think of   that number forty five percent of   african-american children under the age   of six live in poverty another two   million Hispanic Americans have fallen   into poverty under the Obama   administration forty thousand American   veterans are homeless are great people   these are great people yet our   government spends hundreds of billions   providing benefits for people that are   in our country illegally we're going to   turn it around and that begins with a   plan to lower taxes on American   businesses from thirty five percent   which is the highest anywhere in the   world to fifteen percent which is among   the lowest   [Applause]   and that includes massive tax cuts for   family farms you like that family you   have some great farms that will we're   going to protect our family farmers   Hillary Clinton's plan will shut down   family farms all over the nation she   will do this not only through radical   EPA regulation and you know what's   happening the farmers are telling me all   the time EPA is destroying them but also   by raising taxes on family farms and all   businesses to rates as high as 45 and 50   percent adding to the pain hillary wants   to substantially increase the estate tax   on family farms in other words it will   be very hard to leave your farm to your   children and your heirs I'm eliminating   the death tax on top of that her anti   energy agenda will radically drive up   the cost of energy another attack on   agriculture I will end this war on the   American farmer the American farmers are   incredible people these are incredible   people and we will end that war we will   also reverse the EPA intrusion and   eliminate the anti farmer regulations of   which there are so many that it makes it   very hard for you to compete with the   farms of other countries we will protect   corn-based ethanol importantly and we   will also cancel billions of dollars in   climate change payments to the United   Nations and we will use that money to   help rebuild America's infrastructure   it's going to be America first we will   become a rich nation again but to be a   rich country we must also be a safe   country hillary wants a five hundred and   fifty percent increase in Syrian   refugees flowing into archive   and that's over the thousands and   thousands and thousands of people coming   from Syria we don't know who they are   where they're from they're coming from   Syria under President Obama she wants to   increase that number by five hundred and   fifty percent the Hillary refugee plan   would leave us with generations of   terrorism radicalism and extremism   inside of our shores so let me state   this as clearly as I can when I'm   elected president I am going to keep   radical Islamic terrorists out of this   country   [Applause]   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and yes we will build the wall   and yet Mexico will pay for the wall one   hundred-percent hundred-percent we have   a massive trade deficit with mexico   great wonderful people i met with the   leader three months ago President of   Mexico very good meeting but we have a   massive trade deficit with mexico   numbers are staggering the cost of the   wall is peanuts compared to what we're   talking about they will pay for the wall   in one form or the other they may not   know that yet but that's okay countless   Americans who have died in recent years   would be alive today if not for the open   border policies of this administration   this includes incredible Americans like   21 year-old Sara Rue who was right from   this area an incredible young woman and   I've spent time with her amazing family   the illegal immigrant who killed Sara   arrived at the border entered federal   custody and then was released into the   United States community under the   policies of our very weak and very sad   White House he was released again after   he killed Sara and is now at large Sara   graduated from college with a   four-point-oh index top in her class the   day before she was killed her parents   are great people have gotten to know   them they are great people just great   people devastated always devastating   will always be devastated Hillary has   pledged open borders and supports   sanctuary cities under my contract with   the American voter we are going to   cancel all funding for sanctuary cities   immediately we also need a new foreign   policy that puts America first Hillary's   policies have caused disasters in Iraq   Syria Libya and unleashed Isis with the   great vacuum created the vacuum and now   she stands up and says I will get rid of   Isis we didn't have Isis until she came   in they created look we shouldn't have   gone to Iraq once we did the way they   got out was a disaster they created this   great open vacuum and Isis formed Hilary   and our failed Washington establishment   have spent six trillion dollars on wars   in the Middle East and now it's in worse   shape over there than ever before by a   factor of 10 think of it think of it six   trillion dollars we could have rebuilt   our country twice imagine if we use this   money to rebuild America including our   inner cities in Chicago Detroit   Baltimore Pittsburgh our failed   establishment has dragged us into   foreign wars that have made us less safe   had left our borders just totally wide   open and have shipped our jobs and   wealth to other countries cheered on by   the Friends of Hillary who benefit from   this and always cheered on by the very   dishonest media as   back the real question is who's more   dishonest crooked Hillary Clinton or the   media I don't know so close honestly   these are among the most dishonest   people in the world believe me our   corrupt political class has enriched   themselves but left our families with   poverty unemployment and rising crime   now Hilary wants to start a shooting war   in Syria in

Terry Branstad lieutenant   governor Kim Reynolds state GOP chairman   Jeff Calvin Senator Chuck Grassley and   of course a person I've gotten to know   very well who is a tremendous person   Senator Joni Ernst lot of states would   like to have that roster believe me I   also want to take a moment to thank the   bikers we have bikers in the audience   and they're all bikers they call them   bikers for Trump I love the bikers and   they've been so good to me throughout   this campaign so I just want to thank   all of the bikers that really appreciate   it what a fantastic group of people we   have and what a fantastic country we   live in more than anything more than   anything today I want to express my   gratitude because all over the country   we've had such tremendous support to our   amazing veterans a lot of them in the   room thank you   I will not let you down believe me   they've been letting you down for many   years I will not let you down together   we're going to win this state in   November and we are going to win the   White House for the American people   [Applause]   the White House will soon become the   people's house that's what it's going to   be we will tackle and fix the problems   that have gone unsolved for many many   years failing schools crumbling   infrastructure broken borders bloated   bureaucracy wasteful spending and a   government that doesn't work it doesn't   work this is a campaign about big ideas   designed to help everyday people   everyone it's going to help everyone   these are the people who work hard but   who don't have a voice their voice has   been taken away it's also a campaign   about restoring honesty and   accountability to government and you see   what a mess we're in today   [Applause]   the whole world has been shocked by the   continuing revelations regarding Hillary   Clinton and are paying for play State   Department and other things now it was   just announced that her important   calendar records will not be released   even though they have them to the public   until after the election because there's   too much stuff on that they wanted after   the election it's only not terrible it's   protection from a corrupt rigged system   it's disgusting   as I've said many times in recent days   it's hard to tell where the Clinton   Foundation ends and where the State   Department begins that's what's happened   the Clinton it's really what's happened   said the Clinton corruption scandals   have been really there for a long time   and it's been sad sad sad for America   the illegal server too far and happy the   deleted eat of 33 how many 33,000 the   deleted emails 33,000 the secret   schedules the lying to Congress it's all   just too much we're going to have a   great victory on November 8 I can tell   you   [Applause]   thank you how much for 10 voters snakes   not much more Thank You Hillary Clinton   thinks she's entitled to be president by   the way she's got very bad judgment got   very bad judgment even if she thinks   that she's got bad judgment   she thinks she's above the law so far   she's proven that but the truth is it's   the opposite her criminal conduct at   home and her failed interventions   overseas simply make her unfit she is   unfit to serve in the Oval Office I   believe that America is ready to turn   the page on this very sordid past we   don't want another four years of Obama   or Clinton controversies then not only   dangerous but frankly they're exhausting   our people how do you even keep up with   it all how do you do this   at their time on the stage but now it's   time to close that chapter in the   history book and open a brand-new   beautiful chapter   [Applause]   thank you thank you very much that is   why this is such an exciting year to be   a Republican and to vote Republican   we're going to do a great job this year   the GOP is offering the voters a chance   to break up the corrupt establishment   and create a new American future in my   opinion this is our last chance I really   believe that this chance will never come   again and remember justices of the   Supreme Court remember that this chair   it will never ever come again it will   never happen again   I really believe you're not gonna have   this opportunity again the big donors   who want nothing to change are throwing   millions and millions of dollars at my   opponent these are the same people who   pay bill and Hillary Clinton 150 million   dollars for speeches and I guess some   other things Hillary Clinton's campaign   is all about protecting the powerful and   I understand that very well I think   nobody knows the system better than I do   our campaign is about protecting those   who have no power they don't have power   but they're great great people they are   great people without power we're going   to change that   they'll be great fat they will be great   people with power together we're going   to work we're going to give working   people a voice for the first time in   many many decades they haven't had a   voice in a long time let's talk about   what it all means for our veterans it   means a guarantee that they can seek   medical care at either a VA facility or   in a private medical doctor with us   paying the   [Applause]   and thank you because we've had such   incredible veteran support this uniform   all across the land never again will we   allow a veteran to die waiting for the   care they need from a doctor who's a   fine doctor but you can't get to ever   see your doctor you wait six days seven   days nine days people are dying online   that's not going to happen we will   protect those who protect us these are   great people   we are going to protect them it's our   turn now at the center of our change and   this is a change agenda there's also a   plan to fix our rigged economy it's   rigged the government just revised the   growth numbers you probably saw yes   there was a big story   we had horrible growth numbers they were   announced last month they made a mistake   they just announced that the number that   was announced that was so bad was too   high and it had to be readjusted   downward down to one point one percent   just so you understand if China drops   down to eight percent GDP or nine   percent GDP it's a major catastrophe and   the same with other countries and they   do things that you don't want to know   about but they make it impossible for   your businesses to compete but they   consider it a catastrophe here we are   with no growth 1.1 percent which is no   growth and we have the same leaders that   are incompetent and don't know what   they're doing but we're going to make a   change   [Applause]   we're gonna make America grow again   grow that begins with supporting our   family farms right here in Iowa do we   have any farmers in the room do we have   any stand up I want to see what I found   stand up let's go a lot of farmers   that's a lot of farmers Wow   beautiful that's a lot of farmers great   farmers one of the most beautiful   landscapes in the world special if you   like farms right family farms are the   backbone of this country remember them   and I know what's happening to you we   are going to end the EPA intrusion into   your family homes and into your family   farms for no reason what they're doing   to you is it this straight we're going   to get rid of a lot of those regulations   that don't mean anything except goes to   a lot of money at a lot of time and in   many cases you lose your farms over the   regulations we are going to reduce taxes   from thirty five percent to fifteen   percent and the thing the thing that   most surprised me isn't going around all   over the country and talking about that   massive tax cut and also for the middle   class but the massive small business and   business tax cut or the reduction by a   lot of regulations a hundred percent of   the people I talked to feel more   strongly about the regulations and who   would have thought about that who would   have thought that could happen but they   feel more strongly about getting rid of   these horrible really horrible   regulations and that's what we're going   to do   [Applause]   we are going to protect the renewable   fuel standard corn based ethanol   eliminate job-killing regulations like   the waters of the United States rule   which is a disaster   and provide desperately needed tax   relief President Obama President Obama   like you about his support for the   renewable fuel standard and you can   trust Hillary Clinton far less than you   could even Obama she will sell you out   she's already sold you out and her   donors will be the only ones that are   happy believe me and you see it   happening just like Obama he made lots   of promises and then he said bye-bye to   Iowa bye-bye and to other places almost   97% of farms in this country   are family-owned and family management   it's not only a great American tradition   but a vital component of America's   economic and national security so true   yet Hillary Clinton wants to shut down   family farms just like she wants to shut   down the miners and the steel workers   he's gonna shut them down that I can   tell you she will do this not only   through radical regulation but also by   raising taxes on family farms to rates   as high as and I think actually higher   than 50% and just so you understand I'm   cutting taxes massively she is raising   taxes massively raising that   [Applause]   adding to the pain she will tax family   farms again a death by as much as 45%   and you've already paid you tax okay you   paid your tax now you're gonna pay it   again and your children and family it's   very tough situation you know that her   anti-energy agenda will drive up the   cost of energy another attack on   agriculture it's a big attack on what   you're doing because you need the energy   we're going to end this war on the   American farmer you are going to like   Donald Trump so much I'm telling them   you're gonna like them we get it we all   get it we understand what's going on   that includes our plan to lower the tax   rate on family farms down to 15% and to   stop double taxation on the family farms   @s helping to ensure that the family   farm tradition in Iowa continues to   thrive and flourish with your children   and your grandchildren and you'll be   looking down and you'll be happy we hope   you're looking down anyway we hope   you're looking down you'll be very happy   and very proud we're going to make a   very powerful and great trade deal we're   going to have fantastic trade deals   right now we have horrible trade deals   we have the worst straight deals our   country loses if you look at our trade   deficit with the world eight hundred   billion dollars a year can you imagine   this who makes these deals who makes   them to those going through hardship   let me quote some buddies that I got to   know very well Reverend Robert Schuller   tough times don't last tough people do I   think it's a great quote   I think it's a great that's and I know   you're going through a little tough   times with the farms but hang in there   we'll be there soon hopefully for you   I've been so honored to have the support   of the evangelical community all over   the country all of them incredible   people credible and I hope we can   continue to count on evangelical support   on November 8th get out there and vote   we are going to do something very very   special by the way I'm Protestant I'm   Presbyterian can you believe this   everyone says really I don't believe it   I'm presbytery very proud of it we will   get rid of the Johnson amendment which   is a disaster happened in 1954 by Lyndon   Johnson which is which really is a   horrible thing it denies your pastors   their right to free speech and it's had   a huge negative impact on religion a   huge negative we will let your pastors   your ministers your rabbis your priests   we will let them speak again without   losing tax deductibility we will let   them   we will let them speak again we want   them to speak right now they cannot   speak because they will lose all of the   benefits that they used to have 1954 a   complete disaster and it's so important   that the pastor's are going to be   talking to you about it but it's so   important that everybody in the   evangelical community and other   religious communities get out and vote   on November 8th because again this will   be a one-time shot it's going to be gone   don't forget it was only put there in   1954 by Lyndon Johnson so so important   that you get out and vote on November   8th we will get rid of it it should have   never happened in the first place I also   know how much the evangelical community   is deeply committed to helping those in   poverty I know it for a fact   my economic agenda can be summed up in   three words three beautiful words jobs   jobs jobs which we don't have now   I don't even have to mention the   tremendous construction workers in this   room because I think I have every single   one of them I love my construction   workers do you know how much I built   construction worker you have a lot of   construction workers in Iowa I was   actually surprised to see how many but   they love the state and I hope they get   out on November 8th I'm asking for the   support of all Americans who want more   opportunity higher wages safe   communities confident leadership and   honest government very simple   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   thank you   we're going to send the special-interest   packet and we are going to once again   have a government of by and for the   people gonna happen remember and we   sometimes forget Republicans are the   party of Abraham Lincoln pretty good   president right pretty I said I'm gonna   be the most presidential president   you've ever had and then I thought about   Abraham Lincoln and I said well I don't   know he's pretty tough to beat   right Abraham he can use pretty good but   that is a great Republican which brings   me to a subject that is so important and   very personal for me nothing means more   to me than working to make our party the   home of the african-american vote once   again used to be african-americans in   this country so greatly and who deserve   a government that protects and honors   their incredible contributions so many   have been so successful   very nice   but we also have to talk about the   millions of african-americans who remain   trapped in poverty and in failing   schools they're trapped   I've spoken to a lot in recent days a   lot of people and I've spoken a lot   about the deplorable conditions in many   of our inner cities just about all as a   father as a builder as an American it   offends my sense of right and wrong to   see anyone living in such conditions   they are living in terrible terrible   conditions beyond belief   conditions ban almost 40 percent of   African American children are living in   poverty abject poverty including 45   percent of children under the age of 6   in Detroit half of its residents do not   work in Milwaukee almost 4 in 10 African   American men between the age of 24 and   54 are not employed and have no prospect   of employment more than 6,000 African   Americans are the victims of murder of   murder every single year just yesterday   the cousin of NBA star Dwayne rate a   great guy Dwayne Wade with the victim of   a tragic shooting in Chicago she was the   mother of four and was killed while   pushing her infant child in a stroller   just walking down the street shot   it breaks all of our hearts to see it   it's horrible it's horrible and it's   only getting worse   they shouldn't happen in our country   they shouldn't happen in America so we   send our thoughts and prayers to the   family and we also promise to fight for   a much much better tomorrow across thank   you across Chicago more than 2700 have   been shooting victims since January of   this year think of it 2700 people have   been shot since January we cannot as a   society tolerate this level of violence   and suffering in our cities those who   would deny that and you know there are   many people that do and they have their   own reasons many of them are not good   reasons but this is a national crisis   this is a crisis that requires urgent   action have no business none of these   people have any business that support   what's been going on running for elected   office none of these people should be   even allowed to run they're a disgrace   but decades and decades and decades   failed democratic policies the policy of   Hillary Clinton have created this high   crime and crushing poverty absolutely   crushing poverty in so many communities   under Democratic control we have bad   schools no jobs high crime and no hope   it can't get any worse to those   suffering I say vote for Donald Trump I   will fix it african-americans Hispanics   vote for Donald Trump I will fix it it   will get fixed   [Applause]   and I add and I edit in all sincerity   what do you have to lose it can't get   any worse what you have to lose let me   also tell you what you have to gain   millions of jobs far better schools safe   communities where you can in fact walk   outside and walk down the street with   your child with your wife or your   husband by yourself and not be killed   and not be shot not beam up we're gonna   have Safe Communities again and the   African American voter has seen what's   been happening over the last two weeks   or three weeks with me and I'll tell you   I think we have a lot of support out   there they're very very tired of what's   been going on and the Hispanic community   like was they're very sick and tired of   what's going on and has been going on   for decades and decades and decades by   the way how quickly people have   forgotten that Hillary Clinton called   black youth super predators remember   that super predators and they were very   very insulted but now people have   forgotten I'm running to offer a better   future to the citizens of Detroit of   Baltimore of Chicago all across this   great land inner city and outer city all   over everybody we're going to come   together we're going to have one great   country greater than ever before   [Applause]   and what it said is that   african-americans have given so much to   this country they fought and died in   every war since the Revolution they've   lifted up the conscience of our nation   in the civil rights movement they've   sacrificed so much for the National good   now is it time to put a new agenda into   action that expands opportunity ensures   equality and that protects the rights of   each and every citizen including African   American citizens we have to help we   have to stop the crime we have to stop   severe education we have to help with   housing we have to solve our inner-city   problems and we will I will fix it   [Applause]   this includes one of the most important   rights of all the right to live in   safety I will work with communities with   police and with federal law enforcement   to make community safe and secure for   all of our people we are also going to   end the discrimination that traps   parents and kids in failing government   schools our schools are a disaster the   Republican Party and me is a party of   school choice you will see a difference   big-big there is another civil rights   issue we need to talk about and that's   the issue of immigration enforcement   every time an African American citizen   or a Hispanic citizen for any citizen   loses their job to an illegal immigrant   the rights of that American citizen have   been totally violated they're losing   their jobs because it really is it's an   economic question awesome equal   protection under the law must include   the consistent application of our   immigration laws very simple these laws   were passed to protect American citizens   and local residents of our country   for instance federal law protects the   ability of American workers to seek jobs   and employment when government suspends   those immigration laws in order to curry   favor with special interests to give   them campaign contributions and big ones   costing Americans their jobs they have   been denied the protection of their laws   in recent days the media as it usually   does has missed the whole point on   immigration they have missed the point   all the media wants to talk about is the   11 million people or more or less they   have no idea what the number is because   we have no control over our country they   have no idea what it is that are here   illegally but my priority and really is   for the well-being of everybody but in   particular the 300 million Americans and   more and all of our Hispanic citizens   and all of our african-american citizens   legal residents who want a secure border   and I mean secure they want drugs to   stop flowing into their states and into   their community and they want great   growing economy and they want a job my   goal is to provide good jobs and even   great jobs good schools and safety to   every Hispanic community   african-american community in the   country but really what is it it's to   every community every single community   we can't do that if we don't secure our   border we can't do it   the reign of terror and it is that you   go to some places and you will see the   reign of terror will be over and it will   be over fast   remember our law enforcement our police   who by the way should get a tremendous   hand because what they have to put up we   are great people they great through I've   met with so many of the top palliation   the people in the rank-and-file they   know these people so it's not like oh   gee we're going to start they know all   of them they know the good ones the bad   ones they know all of them we are going   to get rid of the criminals and it's   going to happen within one hour after I   take office we start okay bring them   back where they came from in this tennis   we will always err on the side of   protecting the American people we will   use immigration law to prevent crimes   and we will not wait until some innocent   American has been harmed or killed   before taking action we will move justly   but we will move fast believe me and we   will move tough there won't be any games   there won't be any game   these are bad people   [Applause]   what a team we're going to build a great   wall on the border and we're going to   institute nationwide verify stop illegal   immigrants from accessing welfare and   entitlements and develop an egg eggs at   entry and you know what that is   exit entry system to ensure those who   overstay their visas that they're   quickly removed we don't enforce our   visa expiration dates then we have open   borders and we have nothing but crime   it's going to end I'm also going to   cancel all unconstitutional orders   executive orders you've been hearing   about that right in the little objection   little we have a little a little bit of   an excessive executive order president   and then power the rank-and-file ice   officers and border patrol officers to   finally do the jobs that they were meant   to do now what is Hillary Clinton going   to do governor what is he going to do   not much right   she's pledged amnesty in the first 100   days combined with her elimination of   virtually all routine immigration   enforcement in other words totally open   borders which we will leave this is a   massive crime wave that's what's going   to happen it's not gonna happen if I get   elected believe me   muscle arm his pledge to keep President   Obama's executive amnesty which has been   blocked by the Supreme Court directly   disregarding a supreme court injunction   beyond that she's pledged to add another   executive amnesty in violation of both   congressional law and the United States   Constitution these actions from Hillary   Clinton will trigger a crisis greater   than almost anything we've seen this   will be a constitutional crisis like we   haven't seen   in effect he's pledging to abolish the   lawmaking powers of Congress and assumed   the powers of an imperial leader she's   not an imperial later estate young I   don't think so I don't think so he   doesn't she doesn't she doesn't even   look presidential to me she certainly   does this executive amnesty would bypass   Congress to print millions of work   permits and benefit cards to those   ineligible to receive them Hillary   Clinton's legislative plan remember this   is to give illegal immigrants access to   Obama care Social Security Medicare and   US welfare I can see one man that   doesn't like that very much that would   not happen here whatever her plan will   functionally end enforcement of visa   overstay rules another open border   decree she will also close down   detention centers for border crossings   meaning she will have an open southern   border that will bring nothing but crime   and destruction this is not to mention   that she wants a five hundred and fifty   percent interest in Syrian refugees   flowing into a country not so   and she can't even say the words radical   Islamic terrorism and she supports   sanctuary cities and catch-and-release   policies that are getting innocent   American kills and let me tell you we   will end that so quickly we were if I   get the support I need this report will   I have to support you do not a big one   for sanctuary cities I know that I've   met with many of these grieving families   including a family that is truly   incredible the family of Sarah Ruth a a   students training a young beautiful   woman who was killed by an illegal   immigrant who was released from the   border by Obama and the Obama   administration with horrible policy and   then released again after the killing   I've been so inspired by the courage and   bravery of the root family and so many   other families and I have the root   family with us today and I'd like them   to step up and just say hello these are   incredible people   [Applause]   [Applause]   thirty weeks ago today we were watching   our daughter walk across the stage to   get her bachelor's in criminal   investigation not to know that fifteen   hours later she would be killed by   illegal aliens they arrested him the   judge set a bond of fifty thousand   dollars a week after my daughter was   killed he is running free everything we   do all the fight we're doing is to save   the next person from having to go   through what we're going through there   is life cannot be just another life that   was lost because of the Obama   administration like mr. Trump said they   let us down they had him they let him go   they had him again they let him go and I   want to thank him so much for all his   hard work everybody that's helped us try   to keep the story out there try to   prevent this tragedy from happening to   another person because if Hillary gets   in it will continue to happen to   everybody   Trump   [Applause]   [Applause]   what an incredible family and this   happens thousands and thousands of   people the crime is unbelievable and   we're going to stop it we're going to   stop the crime there's a reason that we   just got endorsed by sixteen thousand   five hundred Border Patrol agents they   know the system better than anybody it's   easier for them to just relax but they   wanted to endorse they want to see a   strong border we need a strong border if   we're going to remain a country so I   want to just thank them in particular   thank you it's very divisive it's   radical is reckless it's wrecking the   innocent lives of so many people and we   will have an unprecedented crisis we're   allowing people to come in you're going   to have a crisis like we have never seen   in this country and if I'm elected we   are not going to have a crisis we're   gonna have a strong great country again   so the choice hopefully will be clear to   the people of Iowa and throughout the   country a vote for Trump is a vote to   have a nation of laws and vote for   Clinton is a vote to have dangerous open   borders where anybody can just walk in   and do whatever they want on every issue   our campaign is about making life better   for working people but we can't   accomplish that goal unless we break up   the special interest monopoly and give   the power back to all of the people and   that's what we're going to do many   people have said that establishment   media assault on me and they have said   it that the establishment media assault   on me has been the greatest that they've   ever seen in the political history of   our country I feel that I feel it I know   it even today some major papers failed   to mention how strong our poll numbers   have become over the last two week   period and we're doing very well in Iowa   we have   to believing but but they refused to   print but they'll stop printing if they   have no choice eventually but they   refuse to put it down we're doing great   they do a part of a rigged system the   media is totally dishonest they're a   rigged system trying to deny people the   positive change that they're looking for   and they deserve they take phrases and   statements chop them up take them out of   context and then they discuss them for   days and days and days always trying to   demean and belittle just whatever they   can do to demean and belittle our   incredible movement because we have a   movement they also this is one of the   great movements may be the greatest   movement they've ever seen in the   history of our country and many people   who says that we're going to take our   country back from the death spiral that   is currently in imagine if this much   media attention was spent telling the   truth about the real problems facing our   country imagine if the media spent as   much time telling the story of Sarah   Ruth one of the great young people one   of the truly great outstanding young   people all of the ugly things being said   by Hillary Clinton and our opponents and   you know what they say about me and boy   is that untrue they're spending hundreds   of millions of dollars on ads that a   phony ads false ads and disgusting and   most people know we wouldn't be doing so   well believe me she's funded by the big   banks and Wall Street donors and nothing   more than a desperate attempt by a   failed leader that's all she is and   remember she lost badly to Barack Obama   when she won and I think she's going to   lose badly to Donald Trump word soon   believe me   [Applause]   just wing it in order to keep that rig   system going there's nothing they won't   say or do no lies they won't tell no   amount of money they won't spend to try   and bully voters into giving them what   they want   they lie like I've never seen anything   before the commercials are phony   commercials they're disgusting and even   people on her side are saying that's   going too far   it's very interesting this November 8th   the American people are going to reject   the cynicism of the past and embrace the   optimism of the future we have a great   future the old attacks are not going to   work anymore   the Clinton came fear-mongering isn't   going to resonate with anyone but the   most radical factions of their far left   they said it has gotten far 11 I want to   empower the people Hillary Clinton wants   to scare the people empowering people   begins with three simple words and you   know what those words are our economy is   going to soar we are going to make our   country so strong and so powerful and we   need the power because other people are   not going to want to mess with the   United States of America remember wages   will rise we will make new friends   abroad and we will achieve like we   haven't achieved before and we will   achieve a lasting peace through strength   we will be a country of laws and a   country of great great success our   cities will be safe sound and secure our   government will be honest ethical and   responsive ruled by special interests   will be open / open   the rule of the American people will   begin so let's get out and vote for   November 8 and create the future our   children deserve together we will make   America strong again together we will   make America wealthy again which we have   to do together we will make america   united again we will make Americans safe   again we will make America great again   greater than ever before thank you thank   you very much thank you Joe   [Music]   [Music]

out and told the truth   about Obamacare no fairness he told the   truth two days ago bill clinton torched   President Obama's signature legislation   remember Hillary Clinton called   Obamacare one of the greatest   accomplishments of the president of the   Democratic Party and of our country   except it doesn't work it's a disaster   it's costing everybody including our   country a fortune bill has a different   view oh did he suffer can you imagine   when he walked home to that beautiful   home in Westchester they said hi Hillary   how was your day oh did he suffer bill   called at a system a crazy system and   said that it's the craziest thing in the   world people out there he said are   busting it sometimes 60 hours a week and   wind up with their premiums double and   their coverage cut in half the people   getting killed in this deal or the small   business people and the individuals who   make just a bit too much money to get   any of these subsidies this is Bill   Clinton Bill added he added this is him   this isn't Trump this Bill's letting the   edit it doesn't make any sense and that   insurance model it just doesn't work   [Applause]   oh can you imagine what was going

votes you will   also be voting to protect the Second   Amendment rights of every law-abiding   gun over in Nevada Hillary wants to   effectively abolish at the Second   Amendment by overturning DC vs hell and   thus the cleric that there's not an   individual right to keep and bear arms   you know your second Amendment folks is   under siege I will hope that you vote   for us and remember the Supreme Court   judges one vote and waved goodbye to so   much of what you need and got used to   and what's a real part of our country we   are going to conserve your land and your   natural resources for hunters anglers   and all who enjoy the outdoors like my   sons   [Applause]   fixing our trade deals will be the   foundation of our economic revival my   economic agenda can be sunder and and I   think you know what it is right what is   my economic what is it jobs jobs I don't   have to say it it's jobs our economic   agenda in this room is jobs we're tired   of seeing our jobs disappear our   company's leave they go to Mexico to go   to other places not going to happen   anymore folks China Japan and Europe are   printing huge sums of money the   devaluation of currencies is staggering   as to what it represents for our country   our businesses our citizens and our   workers we're not on a level playing   field and our politicians don't   understand what the hell is going on   they don't understand it they've been   talking for years and years and years   about stopping jobs from moving out   right and you have been big-league hurt   right here big-league you know what I'm   talking about and if somebody wants to   leave your area your state or any other   state and think they're going with their   company to Mexico and they're going to   make that product in Mexico and sell it   back into the United States they can   forget about it they can forget about   and we'll tell them right up front enjoy   your stay in Mexico or wherever you're   planning to go but if you think you're   gonna make an air conditioning unit   carrier you know about carrier that   moving to Mexico think they're going to   make air conditions and just send them   right back into our country no tax no   tariffs 1400 people gone not going to   happen because I'm going to just say   very simply you get a thirty-five   percent tax to pay and you know what   well that happens number one if you say   it before they make their deal or before   they moved in up moving almost a hundred   percent and bottom line if they do move   you know what we're gonna make a lot of   money so that's okay too you know what I   won the state of Indiana I had   tremendous numbers of people who were   fired from carrier following me around   and we had the great coach Bobby Knight   great coach and he endorsed me getting   Bobby Knights endorsement in Indiana was   not bad do we go I mean it was over we   wanted a landslide but it was also   around the time that people started   hearing so much about carrier moving to   Mexico and I will tell you something   that we cannot let this continue to   happen with our companies we are losing   so many companies and we just can't   allow it to happen our nation has lost   one third of its manufacturing job since   Bill Clinton's NAFTA deal he signed it   he signed that deal it's one of the   worst deals ever ever ever made in terms   of trade and Hillary Clinton supported a   total Hillary's Korea deal the deal she   made for South Korea cost us 100,000   jobs and it was supposed to be a   positive and we all knew that it's never   a positive since China entered the World   Trade Organization another bill and   hillary backed disaster 70,000 think of   that i thought it was seven I thought it   was seven hundred seventy thousand   factories have shut down or left the   United States think of them that's 15   factory closings a day on average   because these politicians make these   deals and they have no idea and the ones   that do are taken care of by donors and   special interests that want this to   happen okay the jobs are leaving your   state North Carolina Pennsylvania Ohio   New Hampshire Michigan Illinois Virginia   Olaf and all across the country they're   leaving I'm going to stop the jobs from   leaving our country I'm going to bring   millions of new jobs back into our   country as sure as you standing there   today it's going to be a new day in   America and it's not going to be very   long we have a little ways to wait we   win on november eighth in january you're   going to see a change like you've never   seen before and right now as we speak   although i think they're getting a   little bit nervous because polls came   out about an hour ago people are   starting to get a little bit nervous   especially the media they're saying   what's going on   what's going on I wish those cameras   would turn around and show the people in   this room what's going on the same they   never show the crowd only only one   there's a protester and we have very few   protesters because the fact is that   Bernie Sanders their people had some   passion nobody has passion for Hillary   nobody nobody that guy had passion for   Trump now nobody has passion for Hillary   for too long we've rebuilt other   countries at the expense of her own look   at what China's done to it skyscrapers   going up in Beijing while plants and   factories crumble all over the United   States companies like carrier General   Electric motorola Mattel Fiat Chrysler   and so many others are moving their jobs   to Mexico and other countries all over   the world and now Ford you saw that two   weeks ago just announced it's moving all   of its small car production to Mexico   also and that's after two years ago they   built a two billion dollar plant to   build other things and I think that's   one of the reasons we're doing so well   in Michigan and Ohio believe me we're   doing great in Ohio with five points up   and we're doing very well in Michigan   [Applause]   we are going to renegotiate NAFTA   perhaps the worst straight deal ever   made in a history nut of this country in   the history of the world and if we don't   get the deal we want we will withdraw   from NAFTA and start all over and get a   much much better deal than we ever had   before a two-lane highway   [Applause]   we're also going to lower taxes on   American business from thirty five   percent to fifteen percent and we will   have the largest regulatory reform in   American history taxes too high   companies forced out people losing their   jobs you can't compete the taxes are too   high well one of the highest tax nation   and the world really the highest tax if   you think about it and we're going to be   one of the lower text I'd like to say   the lowest we won't be but one of the   lower tax so we'll moving it down from   thirty five to fifteen percent and you   watch the jobs and you know what we're   doing something else that's maybe even   more important in its own way we're   cutting the hell out of unnecessary   regulations   [Applause]   thousands of new companies and millions   of new jobs and trillions of dollars in   new wealth will come pouring back into   the United States we love the United   States it will be America first you   don't hear that anymore it will be   America first no longer are we worried   about everybody else   look at this drought and we have   thousands of people outside trying to   get it it's like this all over I mean if   you people get out you know it's   interesting we're in New Hampshire for   the primers and people were getting   their four o'clock five o'clock six   o'clock in the morning and it was   freezing it was really cold and the   speech was at seven o'clock in the   evening can you believe this and the   press was saying but will they vote will   they vote now here they're standing in   line for 10-12 hours and they're saying   will they vote for Trump which will take   about three minutes right got to get out   and vote folks even here I know there   were people standing here eight hours   ago it's incredible thank you they want   to get a front-row seat I will stand   they want to get a front-row stand I   hope it's worthwhile I hope it's   worthwhile   [Applause]   thank you   [Applause]   [Applause]   but to be a rich nation we must also be   a secure nation security begins at the   border Hillary Clinton is unfit to be   the president because she supports open   borders   and we have to get rid of sanctuary   cities you see what's going have to get   rid of some chores   we will build the wall and Mexico will   pay for the wall one hundred percent we   will build the world   [Applause]   we will build the wall you know I don't   know if you heard but ice great people   ice they're restricted from doing what   they want to do they just announced that   they were endorsing Donald Trump first   time they've ever done first time in the   border patrol agents incredible people   sixteen thousand five hundred of them   announced that they're endorsing us us   first time they've ever done that never   endorsed the presidential candidate   Sheriff Joe announce that he's in good   so we're good on the border we have no   choice we're not good at the border we   have no country so we have no choice in   fact as Secretary of State chill out   Hillary thousands of criminal aliens to   be freed into our country because their   own countries wouldn't take them back it   was her job to cancel visas to countries   that refuse to take back criminals   criminals coming out of these countries   and we grab the criminal bring them back   to that country and they tell the United   States we're not taken aback they didn't   want them what do they want these horror   shows for right guess what folks with us   when we send them back they're taking   them back not even a doubt   she didn't do it she didn't do it but   when everybody I got all of these   endorsements I'll tell you what so   important to me it means so much when I   get ice when I get all of the different   endorsements it's so important so when   ice endorsed me when other candidates   endorsed we have tremendous support   within the state itself Hillary   Clinton's immigration plans or a   disaster and it's one of the reasons I   have these great endorsement so let me   go for one final state again this is all   a quote from the ice offices Hillary   Clinton has promised the most radical   immigration proposal in the United   States history her radical plan would   result in the loss of thousands of   innocent American lives mass   victimization and death for many   attempting to immigrate to the United   States the total gutting of interior   enforcement the handcuffing of ice   officers and an uncontrollable flood of   illegal immigrants across the united   states borders now this is coming from   ice people this is ice and these are   incredible people their quote continues   she proposes to keep and expand   executive amnesty and to expand   catch-and-release to expand president   obama's non enforcement priorities to   the point where there is virtually no   real immigration enforcement or policing   of visa overstays to support sanctuary   cities to extend obamacare to illegal   immigrants to grant amnesty within 100   days think of that amnesty   and to extend Social Security and   Medicare to illegal immigrants through   amazon thank you   plus a five hundred and fifty percent   increase in admission of Syrian refugees   so we don't even know where they the ice   officers and endorsement concludes by   saying her plan is total amnesty plus   open borders now that's a quote from   people that know this better than   anybody in short Hillary's immigrant   stance is disqualifying she should not   be the president of the United States we   won't have a country left anymore   [Applause]   the first duty of the President of the   United States is to protect the citizens   of the United States anyone who fails to   understand that is unworthy to lead this   nation an amazing statistic is there are   more than two million criminal aliens   with convictions in this country right   now and many more criminal illegal   immigrants who have committed severe   offenses but escaped the law entirely   when President I as president will be   getting them out and getting them out   very very quickly we have no choice   [Applause]   at the same time our country is being   infiltrated and that's the word   infiltrated by terrorists hundreds of   immigrants from high-risk regions have   been implicated in terrorism inside the   United States since nine eleven   terrorists who planted the bombs in new   york and new jersey and who carried out   the mall stabbing you saw that two weeks   ago in minnesota where foreign nationals   admitted into our country as was the   mall shooter and all the shootings in   washington state the Boston bombers were   here on asylum the San Bernardino   shooter she was here on a fiance visa is   that I so fiance wonderful fiance she   came in from Saudi Arabia and probably   radicalized the guy they killed 14   people remember and these were people   that shortly before gave them a party   honoring the birth of their baby killed   him many many wounded 14 killed will   never be the same the Orlando shooter   was the son of a Taliban supporter from   Afghanistan yet Hillary Clinton wants to   throw open the doors to hundreds of   thousands of refugees from the most   dangerous places on our planet people   that in many cases don't love us and   don't love our values we have enough   problems folks we have enough problems   I'm not running to be the president of   the world I'm running to be the   president of the United States and   protect the people of the United   [Applause]   we are going to build the wall we're   going to enforce our laws and we're   going to keep radical Islamic terrorists   the hell out of our country okay   [Applause]   we're going to end government corruption   Hillary Clinton put her emails on an   illegal secret server open too far and   hacking then she bleached and destroyed   you remember that she bleached nobody   ever heard of it it's a very very   expensive process she bleached and   destroyed remember unbelievable 33,000   email she deleted him after   congressional subpoenas so she gets a   subpoena   so she gets a subpoena from Congress I   mean if you got a subpoena from a local   person you're suing with you do that you   know what happens she gets a subpoena   from Congress and she says wow this is   bad delete 33,000 emails just tell   everybody it had to do with the wedding   and yogurt less 30 and i always say i   give five for the wedding and three for   yoga class the rest i want to find out   that is one of the great and she got   away with it i don't know i'm not sure i   don't know if she will get away with   that one she lied to congress under oath   and her staff has took the Fifth   Amendment and got immunity deals she had   so many immunity deals who was nobody   left everybody got immunity in my   opinion it's worse than watergate   Hillary Clinton put her public office up   for sale and if she ever got the chance   she would put the Oval Office up for   sale also   remember what they used to do with the   bedroom in the White House that was just   the beginning now we've learned that the   FBI made a side deal with Clinton stop   aids to destroy their laptops it's okay   to destroy your laptops it's like a   third-world country we're living in this   like a third-world country Americans   have had it with the decades of Clinton   corruption and this will be the year   they say enough is enough   [Applause]   enough is enough folks we're also going   to fix our inner cities and help Latino   Americans and African Americans it's   time Latino who's Latino in this   audience Latino forty-five percent of   african-american children under the age   of six live in total poverty fifty-eight

inner   cities for 50 60 70 even a hundred years   uninterruptible they produced only more   joblessness failing schools and horrible   horrible crime to those African   Americans suffering in our inner cities   I want to say the following what do you   have to lose I will fix it vote for me I   will fix what do you have to live can't   get any worse can't Kennedy was I will   be your greatest champion and I will   deliver real change in justice in your   community I'm also going to fight to   help millions of Latinos trapped in   poverty and to fight to provide school   choice school

  defend the Constitution of the United   States   [Applause]   this election day you have one   magnificent chance I really believe it's   your last chance I really believe that   you know you always hear oh this is the   most important election you hear it   every time you're at it last time your I   think you know this is it when you get   to the Supreme Court one judge replacing   Justice Scalia and the whole balance is   over and we have nothing but problems we   have a whole different country so this   is your last chance to deliver justice   for every forgotten man woman and child   in this country on november eighth the   arrogance of washington DC will come   face to face with the righteous verdict   of the american voter   [Applause]   two failed and corrupt political   establishment will be replaced with a   new government of By and For the People   I am going to fight for every citizen of   every background from every stretch of   this nation and I am going to fight to   bring us all together as Americans for   the first time in a long time we are a   divided country we are not going to be a   divided country for long   [Applause]   imagine what our country could   accomplish if we started working   together as one people under one God   saluting one American flag all right   [Applause]   wouldn't that be nice going to happen   you're going to look back at this rally   for the rest of your life you're going   to remember this day you're going to   remember that this is a movement like   they have never ever seen before in this   country   even the

great honor   for me and during my speech all I talked   about is what Mexico and these other   countries are doing to us and especially   what they're doing to Michigan that's   all I talked about and I was criticized   they said Donald speak about something   else I said no what's happening is   horrible what's happening is terrible   one of the main reasons i ran for   president is to stop it

going to be   consequences if they leave I want to   share a special measures with my many   friends in the union's all across the   state and the union's love me and the   nonunions love me too i will tell you   friends in the union's all across the   stage as well as to democratic voters   here it across our country the economic   policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton   blade as we should you drive motors or   knows more than any other the economic   policy Reagan is expensive dollars for   special interests who specialize in   shipping new jobs to other countries the   Clintons gave us NAFTA think of it the   worst trade deal ever signed by any   country ever China's entry into the   World Trade Organization the job-killing   deal with South Korea another beauty   that was a disaster and Hillary now   wants the trans-pacific partnership she   calls it the gold standard   Hillary Clinton's policies have   devastated your automobile industry all   to the benefit of special interests we   will put a stop to all of that on   november eighth get out and vote   michigan you know i don't know if you've   been seeing what's happening over the   last week or so but they are going while   the very dishonest media the world's   most dishonest people today i was   watching   they're bad people the bad people and   they're dishonest people they don't tell   the truth they don't write the truth but   I will say this so i was watching the   polls we're leading in Ohio we're   leading in Iowa we're leading in New   Hampshire just out dumb town will become   thinking back we're leading I believe in   North Carolina I think we're going to   win it I think we're doing very very   well in the great state of Pennsylvania   watch what happens there watch what   hang in Florida will eating lot of poles   and they're getting a little concerned   this wasn't the way it was supposed to   be but then I said you know I'm hearing   good things about Michigan I've been   here numerous times and then a poll came   out today and it showed we were even in   Michigan that's not so great being even   right but we're even and I said how   could I not lose I mean how is it   possible I gotta win Michigan I'm the   one person in all fairness now you know   they're worried because now Hilary is   going to come out tomorrow and she's   going to come out again   I told her you know what I told her via   television stop you're wasting your time   the people are too smart too smart   they're too smart but she just announced   an extra visit to Michigan you know how   many people she'll have like half of the   front row because without jay-z and   Beyonce and all of these people   and by the way my language is much much   cleaner as you know than jay-z and   Beyonce boy did you hear what I mean   honestly did you hear that the other   night and so many people were insulted   they left because she can't draw a crowd   so she gets stars but there was so   insulted you know their political people   they went in to hear political something   and they hear the worst words the worst   language ever so they mostly left by the   time hillary was left to speak that was   practically nobody there but that's okay   that's okay see and we do this all of   these thousands and by the way by the   way there are thousands and thousands of   people outside trying to get in   thousands   you've got thousands of cars are lined   up three miles down the road it's crazy   and you know the beauty of this crowd   it's without a guitar there's no guitar   there's no pianos you know what it is   it's making America great again that's   what the important thing is that's what   it is because the other stuff frankly is   demeaning to what we all represent us to   meaning real change begins immediately   by repealing and replacing Obamacare   it's just been announced that the   residents of Michigan are going to   experience a massive double-digit   premium hike and I know what the number   is I'm not going to tell you because you   having a good time I don't want to ruin   your evening it's not good but it's not   gonna matter because if you go out and   if you vote for us not for me you're   gonna vote for us we're going to   terminate Obamacare so you're not gonna   have to worry about what in the great   state of Arizona that I just left   premiums are going up more than one   hundred and sixteen percent you're going   to have the same stuff premiums the   surging companies are leaving ensures   the fleeing doctors acquitting and   deductibles are going through the roof   yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down   on Obamacare making it even more   expensive than it already is aren't   affordable   I'm asking for your vote so we can   repeal and replace Obamacare and save   health care for every family in Michigan   and our country   real change also means restoring honesty   to government let's start by getting rid   of Clinton Hillary Clinton   Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt   person ever to seek the office of the   presidency of the United States   the investigations into her crimes will   go on for a long long time the Rankin   files special agents at the FBI won't   let her get away with her terrible   crimes including the deletion of 33,000   emails after receiving a congressional   subpoena they forget about all of this   right now she is being protected by a   rigged system it's a totally rigged   system I've been saying it for a long   time you can't review 650,000 new emails   in eight days you can't do it folks   Hillary Clinton is guilty she knows it   the FBI knows it the people know it and   now it's up to the American people to   deliver justice at the ballot box or   november eighth   unbelievable unbelievable what she gets   away with you know you have general   Cartwright james Cartwright a great   general highly respected for stars last   week for doing practically nothing he's   going to get up to five years in jail   this is a sitting four star general   james clapper he could get as much as   five years for doing nothing by   comparison General Petraeus his life was   destroyed destroyed for doing nothing by   comparison it is a rigged system and be   careful with the voting be careful with   everything you watch everything folks   because we're going to win we don't want   it taken away from us we don't want to   take it away we don't want to take it   away just watch obama statements from   eight years ago and what he said about   chicago and the rigged system in chicago   take a look at what he said about the   rigged system in chicago the same system   that's protecting hillary clinton is the   rigged system thats stolen you jobs and   shipped our wealth all of us our wealth   overseas and to Mexico so one way   highway into these countries nothing   comes back we get drugs we get   unemployment we get poverty they get   jobs they get everything one way it's   one way it's going to be a two-way   Highway maybe it's going to be a one-way   for a little while we got to make up   it'll be one way back into our country   nobody wants to report this the press   doesn't want to report it just like the   press will not show this incredible   crowd   the Prince won't show this ground i just   left Minnesota we had a crowd that was   unbelievable I saw one of the reporters   say it was unbelievable it was this size   they're all you don't even know I mean   look at the size little people man this   is unbelievable   but you have to say it's even more   impressive when you can double it up   standing outside that's even more   impressive but we just had a big crowd   and I see one of the reporters saying   we're here in Minnesota and Donald Trump   is speaking before grout of people give   me a break we have the biggest crowds   and it's the greatest movement ever in   the history of our country we now have   to go out and we have to

you   imagine okay okay i love debating her by   the way who won the debate should we win   the debates you know people are talking   about the big friday but the truth is   since the last debate

and hillary back disaster we are   living through the greatest jobs theft   in the history of the world there's   never been anything like what we're   living through our jobs are taken just   like nothing because our politicians are   stupid people they don't know what to do   it's so simple Delphi laid off 3627   workers and move their jobs to Mexico   and other countries FTE automotive laid   off 166 workers in auburn hills nice   place and move their jobs to Mexico   Chrysler laid off 5,300 workers and move   their gym to Mexico Chrysler laid off   5,300 workers and move their jobs to   Mecca five workers and move their jobs   too many countries in particular Mexico   toward built a master Factory in Mexico   two years ago course two billion dollars   and I've strongly been criticizing that   that was my main point for two and a   half years I've been criticizing it now   Ford is moving all of its small car   production a hundred percent to Mexico   [Applause]   everyone wants to move to Mexico and   other countries because we have   politicians that have no clue as to what   to do and it's so simple it's so so   simple it's not going to happen if I'm   president believe me and when Hillary   comes and when Hillary walks onto the   stage and talks you for about eight   minutes because that's what she's got   left don't you got you need a lot of   energy to beat these folks and you need   a lot of you know what it used to be the   cars were made in Flint and you couldn't   drink the water in Mexico now the cars   are made in mexico and you can't drink   the water in Flint   [Applause]   we will turn it all around a trump   administration will stop the jobs from   leaving America and we will stop the   jobs from leaving Michigan we're going   to be opening up new jobs lots of new   jobs and jobs are going to be coming   back as an example if Ford or another   company wants to fire their workers in   Michigan and move to another country   like Mexico and ship their products back   into the United States across what will   soon be a very very strong and powerful   border   [Applause]   [Applause]   we will build the Great Wall we will   build the girl went you well so if they   wanted to I love you too sounds like a   rough cookie he's not my type but I love   him thank you very much   we will give them a little call and   we'll call I will and I want to do it   myself you know they'll say but it isn't   presidential you're not supposed to be   calling the head of the automobile   company to say you can't move and tell   them if they want to move their factory   if they want to move their plants they   will have to pay a thirty-five percent   tax to get their cars coming back into   the United States and you know it's   going to happen right they're not going   to move it's very simple the politicians   could have said this a long time ago I   told them a long time ago they could   have said it Hillary will never say it   because she's taken care of by all these   donors and special interests they don't   want that to happen there will be   consequences when they think they're   going to fire all their employees in   Michigan or Ohio or so many other places   I'm going in a little while I'm going to   pittsburgh tonight then I'm going to   Virginia tonight   we have to do it we have to make sure we   get over the finish line we're winners   we have to win we know how to win we   have to work they're never going to move   they're never going to move in if they   do move that's okay too we're going to   make a lot of money as a country they'll   be paying a lot of tax to come back into   our country they're not going to fire   our people and take our jobs anymore a   trump administration will renegotiate   NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we   want we will terminate NAFTA and get a   much better deal for our workers and our   companies we will also immediately stop   the job-killing trans-pacific   partnership Hillary Clinton wants to   pass TPP trans-pacific partnership which   will destroy the remaining parts of the   auto industry just like she pushed   through the Korean deal you remember   that she said it was going to be   wonderful but that destroyed many of   your jobs especially having to do with   automotive as part of our plan to bring   back jobs we are going to lower taxes on   American business from thirty-five   percent to fifteen percent   we will massively cut taxes for the   middle class and Hillary Clinton is   going to raise your taxes you know that   she's going to raise your taxes we will   unleash American energy including shale   oil natural gas and clean coal and we   will rebuild our inner cities we're   going to rebuild and we can do it and by   the way the african-american community   the Hispanic community I love that song   blacksmith drop I love this thank you   it's very cool the african-american   community the Hispanic community living   in the inner cities the inner cities   have been run for up to a hundred years   by the Democrats and all they want is   every four years they come in and they   say we want your vote we want your vote   after they get your vote they say see   you in four years they do nothing crime   is rampant you can't walk through the   store without getting shot crime is   rampant education is the worst there is   practically anywhere you know that and   there are no jobs so you have no jobs   your bed education and you have rampant   crime and I say to the african-american   community to the Hispanic community vote   for me what the hell do you have to lose   I'm going to fix it i am going to fix it   we're going to fix it will bring back   our jobs will have safety will have   education will have security and will   have hope we will become a rich nation   once again but to be a rich nation we   must also be a safe nation Hillary   Clinton wants a five hundred and fifty   percent increase in Syrian refugees   pouring into our country   and virtually unlimited immigration from   the most dangerous regions of the world   her plan will import generations of   terrorism extremism and radicalism into   your schools and throughout your   communities when I am elected president   he just said it's already that way mr.   Trump he's gone it's already that way   mr. Trump thank you I just didn't want   to say it I want to be politically   correct we will suspend the Syrian   refugee program and we will keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of our   country   one hundred percent here in Michigan   you've seen firsthand the problems   caused with the refugee program you're   big I mean we're reading about it all   the time in Michigan with large numbers   of poorly vetted refugees coming into   your state without your knowledge   without your support and without your   approval it puts your security at risk   that it puts enormous pressure on your   schools and your community resources a   trump administration will not admit any   refugees without the support of the   local community where they are being   placed okay where they are being closed   it's unfair unfair to Michigan unfair   what's happening in Michigan   and we will pause admissions from tara   prone regions of the world until a full   security assessment has been performed   and until proven vetting mechanisms have   been established what they're doing to   michigan and other states including by   the way minnesota which is having a   terrible problem but what they're doing   to your state is disgraceful a trump   administration will also secure and   defend the borders of the united states   and yes we will build that great wall   and Mexico will pay for that great   Hillary Clinton supports   [Applause]   you are amazing people amazing   Hillary Clinton supports totally open   borders there goes your country   and strongly support sanctuary cities   like San Francisco where Kate Steinle   was murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported at least five times thousands   of Americans would be alive today if   we're not for the open border policies   of Obama and Clinton just days ago a   young single mother of five children was   strangled to death in Kent County her   name was Carla the man who was   reportedly admitted he was an admitted   murderer twice deported and he everybody   was begging they say please please   incarcerate him deport him don't let   this happen don't let this happen and   Carla is no longer with us Carla is no   longer with us he's been using a false   name he had a long felony record in   Texas and he wasn't it he wasn't   deported everybody knew he had to be   deported and he wasn't because the Obama   administration had no mechanism to do it   a trump administration will end this   nightmare of violence we will stop   illegal immigration deport all criminal   aliens and dismantle every last criminal   gang in cartel threatening our citizens   folks go to remembrance project you'll   see some incredible people you'll see   what's going on so many people thousands   and thousands of people we will also   repeal the obama-clinton defense   sequester and rebuild our badly depleted   military I'm honored to have the   endorsement of more than 200 top   Admirals and generals and 22 medal of   honor recipients Hillary and our failed   establishment have spent six trillion   dollars on wars in the Middle East that   we never win you have a note we never   win we just keep fighting we just keep   fighting we're going into Mosul they say   four months four months we are going in   four months into Mosul because we want   to capture the leaders of Isis who are   staying in Mosul well the problem is as   soon as they say that those leaders are   gone it's terrible I tell you what I'll   tell you what Obama should spend no time   no time fighting for the election of   Hillary not going to happen it's not   going to happen he's campaigning for   Hillary Clinton he ought to be back in   the office working on jobs working on   defeating Isis working on our borders   working on building up our military this   guy all he wants to do his campaign and   you know why you know why because she   can't campaign for herself let's face it   she has no talent she's got no ability   she's got bad instincts according to   Podesta how about the WikiLeaks Hillary   has bad instance Hilary has been   instincts right and how about Bernie   Sanders he says she has bad judgment so   bad instincts bad judgment she's going   to be your president I don't think so   just look at how she's boxed up her   emails okay now multiply that out toward   running our country I don't think that's   the way we want to be four more years of   Obama we don't want they've dragged us   into foreign wars that have made us less   safe shipped our jobs and wealth to   other countries and left our borders at   home wide open you ever notice we fight   so hard for other people's borders   countries that you've never heard of   we're fighting for their borders but we   don't fight for our own borders right   that will all change in november eighth   you got to get out and vote   they say the greatest movement in the   history of our country it is the   greatest movement in the history of our   country but it all would end if you   don't get out and if you do get out they   have not got even a little chance to win   they have no chance to win even the   pundits the pundits many of whom aren't   exactly in love with Donald Trump say   it's the single greatest movement in the   history of our country it is never been   anything like this there's never been   anything like this we got more votes in   the Republican primary than anybody else   in the history of the Republican Party   one by one by one we have great support   ben Carson and so many other people Mike   Huckabee so many people so much great   support we're going to go in tuesday and   we're going to win like they've never   seen this is going to be brexit plus   brexit plus they don't know what's going   to come they don't know what's going to   be coming their way you know in Florida   the lines are so long they've never seen   lines like this they've never seen lines   like this the lines are so long they   don't know what's coming actually they   do know what's coming and they're not   happy about a trump administration will   never ever put the interests of a   foreign country before the interests of   our country from now on it's going to be   America first   to all Americans I say it's time for   change it's time for leadership and just   in closing I want you to think about   what we can accomplish in the first 100   days of a trump administration we are   going to have the largest tax cut since   Ronald Reagan she's going to raise your   taxes Hillary is going to raise it we   will save and protect your Social   Security and Medicare she will reduce   and cut up your Social Security and   Medicare benefits we will eliminate   unnecessary job-killing regulations   thank you we are going

Supreme Court who will uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   States   it is time to cut our ties with the   failed politicians of the past you see   what's happened in Michigan you see   what's happened to all over the country   you look at what's going on in   Pennsylvania you look at what's going on   in upstate New York you look at what   took place in New England no matter

Jackson and so many others   and so many others actually sitting here   Daryl Scott we have whose phenomenal   who's been with me for so long   so long Omarosa who's actually a very   nice person but I don't want to say that   cuz I'll destroy her image by saying   that she's actually a very very fine   person and a pastor and I just want to   thank all of the folks and and there is   somebody that's been very special to me   dr. ben Carson who's been stand-up in   this is a great man and a great guy   so as I prepare to campaign all across   the nation   and in every community I will have an   opportunity to lay out my plans for   economic change which will be so good   for Detroit and so good for this   community because we're gonna bring jobs   back I will have a chance thank you   giving them back taking them back from   Mexico and everywhere else because   they're they're gone I will have a   chance to discuss school choice it's   very important and how to put every   American on the ladder to success a   great education a great job but today I   just want to let you know that I am here   to listen to you and I've been doing   that and we had a fantastic interview   with Bishop Jackson was really an   amazing interview he's better than the   people that do that professionally   and I didn't really know what I was   getting myself into I didn't know is   this gonna be nice is this gonna be   while he is a great gentleman and a very   smart guy I just hope you don't lose him   to Hollywood that's see all their   problems and especially an especially   dr. Jackson's you may be gun Hollywood   his college look at all look at all   those television cameras back look at   all the television I'm sorry to do that   to you Bishop because you know what are   those things right our nation is too   divided we talk past each other not to   each other and those who stick office do   not do enough to step into the community   and learn what is going on they don't   know they have no clue I'm here today to   learn so that we can together remedy   injustice in any form and so that we can   also remedy economics so that the   african-american community can benefit   economically through jobs and income and   so many of the different ways our   political system has failed the people   and works only to enrich itself I want   to reform that system so that it works   for you everybody in this room   I believe true reform can only come from   outside the system I really mean that   being a businessman is much different   than being a politician because I   understand what's happening and we are   going outside of the establishment   becoming the nominee of the party of   Abraham Lincoln a lot of people don't   realize that Abraham Lincoln the great   Abraham Lincoln was a Republican has   been the greatest honor of my life it is   on his legacy that I hope to build the   future of the party but more important   the future of the country and the   community I believe we need a civil   rights agenda for our time one that   ensures the rights to a great   so important and the right to live in   safety and in peace and to have a really   really great job a good paying job and   one that you love to go to every morning   and that can happen need to bring our   companies back it also means the right   to have a government that protects our   workers and fights really fights for our   jobs I want to help you build and   rebuild Detroit and we can do that   especially with people like Bishop   Jackson and dr. Jackson   I've been an amazing experience   it's been an amazing experience nothing   is Bohr said then when we sideline young   black men with unfulfilled potential   tremendous potential I met some people   this morning that were incredible people   and they're looking for jobs these are   incredible people young people our whole   country loses out when we're unable to   harness the brilliance and the energy of   these folks we're one nation and when   anyone hurts we all hurt together and   that's so true so true we're all   brothers and sisters and we're all   created by the same God we must love   each other and support each other and we   are in this all together all together I   fully understand that the   african-american community has suffered   from discrimination and that there are   many wrongs that must still be made   right they will be made right I want to   make America prosperous for everyone I   want to make this city the economic envy   of the world we can do that we can do   that again   factories everywhere new roads and   bridges new schools especially schools   and new hope I have been so greatly   blessed and in so many ways with no   greater blessing than my family had a   great family nothing would make me   happier and more fulfilled than to use   what I have learned in business and in   traveling all over the world that sort   of seen a lot to bring the wealth and   prosperity and opportunity to those who   have not had these opportunities before   that's many many people in Detroit when   I see wages falling people out of work I   know the hardships this inflicts and I   am determined to do something about it I   will do something about it   I do get things done I will tell you   some people have strengths it's one of   my so I get things done I'm gonna get   things done for you please know this for   any who are hurting things are gonna   turn around tomorrow will be better to   be much better that the pastor and I   were talking about riding up the street   and we see all those closed doors and   people sitting down on the sidewalk and   no jobs and no activity will get it   turned around will get it turned around   pastor we're going to win again as a   country and we're going to win again for   all of our people I want to work with   you to renew the bonds of trust between   citizens and the bonds of faith that   make our nation strong America has been   lifted out of many of its most difficult   hours through the miracle of faith and   through people like Bishop Jackson and   dr. Jackson   people have no idea how important they   are now at these hard times for our   country let us turn again to our   Christian heritage to lift up the soul   of our nation I am so deeply grateful to   be here today and it is my prayer that   America of tomorrow   and I mean that that the America of   tomorrow will be one of unity   togetherness and peace and perhaps we   can add the word prosperity hey presto   I'd like to conclude with a passage from   first John chapter 4 you know   see most groups I speak to don't know   that but we know if you want we can say   it together no one has ever seen God but   if we love one another God lives in US   and his love is made complete in US and   that's so true thank you very much this   has been such an honor thank you very   much bishop thank you sir thank you   thank you   thank you   so here's another title now preacher   honey   my wife and I give you something that's   gonna be a blessing to you this this is   a a prayer shawl straight from Israel   and with this fresh y'all whenever you   hold this for me please   flying from coast to coast I know you   just came back from Mexico and you'll be   flying from city to city   there is a there is no 19 that 19 is the   power of God   I   when the women who ate the issue of   blood said that I can only touch the hem   of Jesus garment I will a whole nothing   else could help her but the power of God   this might be some times in your life   that you're gonna feel forsaken you're   gonna feel down but the anointing is   gonna get to you up I'm going through I   pray over this person   and   this is the Jewish heritage Study Bible   and we have it especially for you   and we have one for your wife because   when things go down you can study the   Word of God when things sing like is   almost impossible   you will read mark 9:23 if thou canst   believe   [Applause]

be   here today and to shine a national   spotlight on a group of victims who have   been forced and I mean truly forced into   the shadows your stories are not   featured in the news you have no   demonstrators taking to the streets in   your behalf you have no special interest   taking up your cause and the politicians   ignore your cries for help but I never   will i will ever   [Music]   [Applause]   and I've known many of you for a long   time now it seems like a long time but   I'm still here and you're still here   right still fighting I've met many   incredible people during the course of   this campaign but nothing has moved me   more deeply than the time I've spent   with the families of the remembrance   project folks in remembrance by the way   are doing such an incredible job   [Applause]   and the strength and the courage that   you've shown in your very often lonely   fight for justice will get there you are   the heroes you are and your actions will   help us to save the next thousand   American citizens from losing their   brothers and sisters and sons and   daughters and parents the most   fundamental duty of government is to   protect American lives   [Applause]   anyone who fails to understand this is   not fit to hold public office   [Applause]   every day our border remains open   innocent Americans are needlessly   victimized and killed every day   sanctuary cities are left in place   innocent Americans are put in harm's way   every day we fail to enforce our laws in   a day and this is absolutely happening   all the time is a day when a loving   parent is at risk of losing their child   and it's happening every single day all   across this country dining room tables   have an empty seat at the family table   because our government abandoned its   duty and failed to enforce its basic   laws there are a lot of numbers the   immigration debate I've been talking   about it for a long time and obviously   people agree with me because you see   what's happening you see the numbers you   see the polls you see what's going on at   the rallies a lot of people agree with   me almost it seems everybody agrees you   almost say what's not to agree with but   let me give you what's not to avoid   but let me give you the most important   number of all that most important number   of all is the number of American lives   that is acceptable to lose in the name   of illegal immigration let me tell you   what that number is zero   [Applause]   our nation should not accept one lost   American life because our country failed   to enforce its laws what do you tell the   mother who just buried her daughter   because someone was released at the   border who should have been sent home or   should have been imprisoned in another   country what do you tell the young boy   who will grow up without a dad because   the criminal was deported 5 times but   was allowed to keep coming back and   coming back and coming back into our   country doing tremendous harm what do   you tell the wife who's lost her husband   because a sanctuary city released an   illegal immigrant from behind bars this   has to end it will end if I become   president I promise you   [Music]   [Applause]   thank you   [Applause]   thank you everybody thank you i love you   love everybody in this room special   special people not one more american   life should be given up in the name of   open borders just look at what happened   in the last few days last week it was   reported that authorities detained an   illegal immigrant in the austin area who   was responsible for nearly a dozen   sexual assaults and had been previously   deported five times within a three year   period earlier this week in Kansas a   Sheriff's Department master deputy was   killed apparently by an illegal   immigrant the driver was previously   arrested for DUI in California in 2001   and for traffic violations in Kansas   deputy Collins was killed only hours   after his daughters fourth birthday a   few days ago to correctional officers in   California were critically wounded after   being shot by an illegal immigrant who   overstayed his visa this individual had   been convicted of child rape and was   slated to be deported but his home   country refused to take him back he was   simply too bad too tough to evil they   said we refuse to take him back one of   the victims has six children is an Air   Force veteran in a high school football   coach the other victim is a mother and a   grandmother when Hillary Clinton was   Secretary of State the matter of this   country and think of this think of this   matter of this country refusing to take   back their deported Sue's and came   before Hillary Clinton's desk often   times many times but she failed to take   forceful action and ignore the federal   law   requiring her to suspend reasons to   countries that don't take back their   citizens she didn't want to get involved   politician politicians according to a   report from the Boston Globe from the   year 2008 through 2014 nearly 13,000   criminal aliens were released back into   u.s. communities because their home   countries would not take them back they   were too tough they were too angry they   were too evil they don't want them back   and we don't force them back we want to   be nice people that we want to be nice   and politically correct and they're all   roaming the streets most of these 13,000   releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's   watch she had the power and the duty to   stop it cold and she didn't now my   opponent will never meet with you never   meet with you no interest you know that   because you've been trying for a long   time years they've been trying for years   she will never hear your stories she   will never share your pain she will only   meet with the donors and the special   interests and the oprah and in on the   open border advocates her plan calls for   total amnesty in the first 100 days   which means obamacare Social Security   and Medicare for illegal immigrants her   plan calls   her plan calls for catch and release on   the border sanctuary cities ignoring   visa overstays closing detention centers   and a virtual end to immigration   enforcement in the United States of   America Hillary Clinton has even   announced that she plans to go around   Congress and implement amnesty by   executive order violating our   Constitution and putting the entire   nation in grave peril Hillary Clinton is   the person and I mean the first person   to ever run for the presidency of a   country effectively proposing to abolish   the borders around the country that   she's supposed to be representing but   the media doesn't want you to know that   so they'll never ask her any questions   about her plan won't be talked about at   the debate which is going to be a very   interesting period of time   my couch ill afford to give lifetime   welfare and entitlements to illegal   immigrants or how many people will be   victimized because of the illegal   immigrants that will be released from   federal custody right at the border or   inside of the corner she's not asked to   explain what she'll say to the American   workers who lose their jobs when she   prints out millions of work permits for   those here totally against the law many   of whom have very very substantial   problems your cause and your stories are   ignored by our political establishment   because they are determined to keep our   border open at any cost to them your   presence is just too inconvenient it's   all it is it's an inconvenience but help   is coming tell you that   [Applause]   on november eighth we're going to win   the White House   [Applause]   and we are going to deliver justice for   every American family and every single   American victim you know what that means   you know what that means together we   will save American lives and prevent the   next thousand American parents from   suffering the same fate as the people in   this room today their loved ones will   not have died in vain believe me since   2013 11 think of this since 2013 the   Obama administration has allowed three   hundred thousand criminal aliens to   return back into the United States and   its communities these are individuals   encountered or identified by ice but who   were not detained or processed for   deportation according to the federal   government's own data there are more   than two million convicted criminal   illegal immigrants inside of the United   States right now two million then we   wonder why do we have such crime why do   we have such violence and this is true   violence this is violence like most   people have never even heard of before   however this figure does not include the   many individuals who have committed   crimes but escaped justice fled the   jurisdiction or were otherwise never   caught and many of the folks are in that   position where you even sometimes know   who they are and yet they're never   caught we're going to catch him   [Music]   many crimes committed by people here   illegally remain open cases and yet our   government knows a lot about the people   that did it but they don't go after   they've killed people they don't go   after him at the same time hundreds of   individuals who have been given visas   and refuge and think of this they've   been given visas their refugee   admissions into the country subsequently   were charged with terrorism and nobody   does anything about it nobody does   anything about it it's the most   unbelievable thing that I've seen that's   why I become it's like become a personal   passion for me when I see these people   and there's so many people remember it's   project there are so many people this is   a small group a lot of people it's a   small group compared to what we're   talking about the devastation is   unbelievable so we're admitting people   here with no idea of who they are and we   don't know very much about them we don't   know what they believe we don't know if   they have love in their heart for our   country or if they have hatred in their   heart for our country whether it's drugs   terrorism or violent crime our   government is utterly failing in its   core mission to defend and protect the   people of this country the Border Patrol   agents these are incredible people they   endorsed me first time they've ever   endorsed a presidential   [Applause]   they've worn that Hillary Clinton's plan   would put the entire country in grave   danger I fully understand they called it   radical deeply dangers and warned it   would trigger an unprecedented national   crisis they know they know better than   any consultant they know better than   anybody the Border Patrol agents let's   just remember our goal to prevent the   next family from suffering the same   terrible fate   [Applause]   that is what is at stake in this   election so I am now going to invite   some of the bravest people I know and I   mean that one hundred percent to come up   here and speak let's start

_R4L-Os2LSI~DONALD TRUMP SPEECHES & PRESS CONFERENCE~20161022~FULL EVENT: Donald Trump Foreign Policy Speech In Gettysburg, PA (10/22/2016) First 100 Day Plan~219613.0~4.82249403~3747.0~174.0~   please welcome mr. Donald J Trump   [Applause]   [Applause]   thank you very much thank you ladies and   gentleman thank you please sit down   thank you thank you it's my privilege to   be here in Gettysburg hallowed ground   where so many lives were given in   service to freedom amazing place   President Lincoln served in a time of   division like we've never seen before it   is my hope that we can look at his   example to heal the divisions we are   living through right now we are a very   divided nation I'm not a politician and   I've never wanted to be a politician   believe me but when I saw the trouble   our country was in I knew I couldn't   stand by and watch any longer our   country has been so good to me I love   our country and I felt I had to act   I've seen the system up close and   personal for many years I've been a   major part of it I know how the game   works in Washington and on Wall Street   and I know how they've rigged the rules   of the game against everyday Americans   the rules are rigged nearly one in four   Americans in their prime earning years   isn't even working one in five   households have no one with a job 45   million Americans are on food stamps and   47 million are living in poverty we have   failed our inner cities and in so doing   have failed our african-american and   Hispanic communities we've misguided   military adventures overseas and wars   that go on forever that just cannot be   won by the people that are doing it now   they don't know how to win the wars at   home we have our great veterans dying   while waiting for medical care change   has to come from outside our very broken   system our system is broken the fact   that Washington and the Washington   establishment has tried so hard to stop   our campaign is only more proof that our   campaign represents the kind of change   that only arrives once in a lifetime   the system is totally rigged and broken   first the issue of voter fraud according   to Pew there are 24 million voter   registrations in the united states that   are either invalid or significantly   inaccurate and when i say that there are   such inaccuracies it's unbelievable 1.8   million dead people are registered to   vote and some of them are voted i wonder   how that happens 2.8 million people are   registered in more than one state he's a   numbers folks these are numbers fourteen   percent of non-citizens are registered   to vote the system is also rigged   because Hillary Clinton should have been   precluded from running for the   presidency of the United States but the   FBI and the Justice Department covered   up her crimes which included lying to   the FBI and Congress on numerous   occasions and included saying I do not   recall to the FBI on 39 separate times   she recalls everything else but 39   separate times she said I do not recall   well that's a lie also   that there is the deletion of at least   33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena   from the United States Congress that's   after receiving the subpoena as an   example it was announced this week that   the highly respected four-star general   james Cartwright may be sentenced to up   to five years in prison with a massive   fine for a lying on one occasion to the   FBI and he said he did that for national   security reasons highly respected men a   four-star general this took place two   days ago how much he feel a big part of   the rigging of this election is the fact   that Hillary is being allowed to run   despite having broken so many laws on so   many different occasions why is she   allowed to run the dishonest mainstream   media is also part and a major part of   this corruption   they're corrupt they lie and fabricate   stories to make a candidate that is not   their preferred choice look as bad and   even dangerous as possible at my rallies   they never show or talk about the   massive crowd size and try to diminish   all of our events on the other hand they   don't show the small size of Hillary's   crowds but in fact talk about how many   people are there very small crowds you   know it they know it everybody knows it   over the last two days three highly   respected national polls said we're in   first place   and one of those pollsters was the most   accurate poll on the last two cycles but   the media refuses to even say it or put   that word out they refuse to talk about   it they're drunk desperately to suppress   my vote and the voice of the American   people as an example of the power   structure I'm fighting AT&amp;T is buying   time warner and the CNN a deal we will   not approve in my administration because   it's too much concentration of power in   the hands of too few   likewise amazon which through its   ownership controls the washington post   should be paying massive taxes but it's   not paying and it's a very unfair   playing field and you see what that's   happening and what that's doing to   department stores all over the country   very very unfair and you're talking   about billions and billions of dollars   they should be paying those taxes   additionally comcast purchase of NBC   concentrates far too much power in one   massive entity that is trying to tell   the voters think and what to do deals   like this destroy democracy and we'll   look at breaking that deal up and other   deals like that this should never ever   have been approved in the first place   they're trying to poison the mind of the   American voter every woman lied when   they came forward to hurt my campaign   total fabrication   the events never happened never all of   these liars who after the election is   over   but a simple phone call placed to the   biggest newspapers or television   networks gets them wall-to-wall coverage   with virtually no fact-checking   whatsoever here is why this is relevant   to you if they can fight somebody like   me who has unlimited resources to fight   back just look at what they can do to   you your jobs your security your   education your health care the violation   of religious liberty the theft of your   second Amendment the loss of your   factories your homes and much more look   at what they've done to you with your   jobs it has just been learned on video   that the violent protests at some of my   rallies like in Chicago where police and   others were seriously hurt you saw that   blood pouring down their face were   caused by paid paid DNC and Clinton   campaign operatives now we didn't know   this we didn't know this this just came   out two days ago on tape we didn't know   this we were amazed at the level of   violence these will paid operatives paid   by the DNC and probably the Clinton   campaign this is the criminal act   policemen were badly hurt and so were   many others and these people should be   prosecuted but   but because of the rigged system they   probably won't be just like we found out   about these paid violent protesters it   was probably the DNC and the Clinton   campaign that put forward these Liars   with their fabricated stories but we'll   find out about their involvement at a   later date through litigation and I look   so forward to doing the rigging of the   system is designed for one reason to   keep the corrupt establishment and   special interests in power at your   expense and everybody's expense I have   no special interest but you the American   robot   I didn't have to do this believe me   there's nothing easy about it but I had   to do it I love our country I love the   people of our country and I felt I had   to go thank you one thing we all know is   that we will never solve our problems by   relying on the same politicians who   created these problems in the first   place Hillary Clinton is not running   against me she's running against change   and she's running against all of the   American people and all of the American   voters we now find ourselves at that   very special fork in the road do we   repeat the mistakes of the past or do we   choose to believe that a great future   yet unwritten still lies ahead for us   and for our wonderful beloved country I   think it does I know it does my economic   plan will deliver at least 25 million   jobs in one decade now our jobs have   been taken away they've gone to Mexico   they've gone to so many other countries   it's a one lane highway where they get   the jobs they get the factories they get   the money and we get the drugs and we   get the unemployment and it's going to   change believe me it's going to change   and that goes for all countries when you   look at China when you look at every   country every trade deal we have is   horrible and we should be ashamed of a   people and the people that let those   deals happen they're defective and they   knew they were defective and they were   done for a reason and believe me they   will be unwound so fast and we will have   trade we will have great trade and it'll   be free trade but it'll be fair trade   and it'll be real my security plan so   important they've taken the jobs from us   my security plan will bring safety to   our poorest communities my ethics plan   will end the corruption in our   government we will   corruption is massive you will drain the   swamp in Washington DC and replace it   with a new government of By and For the   People aluminum that is why I have   chosen Gettysburg to unveil this   contract I'm asking the American people   to rise above the noise and the clutter   of our broken politics and to embrace   that great faith and optimism that has   always been the central ingredient in   the American character and there's   nothing better or stronger than the   American character   I am asking the American people to dream   big once again what follows is my 100   day action plan to make America great   again it's a contract between Donald J   Trump and the American voter and it   begins with bringing honesty   accountability and change to Washington   DC therefore on the first day of my term   of office my administration will   immediately pursue the following six   measures to clean up the corruption and   special interest collusion in Washington   first a constitutional amendment to   impose term limits on all members of   Congress   second a hiring freeze on all federal   employees to reduce federal workforce   through attrition exempting military   public safety and public health   third a requirement that for every new   federal regulation to existing   regulations must be eliminated   regulations are killing our country and   our jobs for a five-year ban on White   House and congressional officials   becoming lobbyists after they leave   government service making a fortune   fifth a lifetime ban on white house   officials lobbying on behalf of a   foreign government over six a complete   ban on foreign lobbyists raising money   for American elections that's what's   happening on the same day I will begin   taking and really taking strongly seven   actions to protect American workers our   American workers have been treated so   badly by politicians that don't have   their interest in art and we're going to   change that we're going to change that   very very fast first I will announce my   intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA   one of the worst deals our country has   ever made signed by Bill Clinton or   withdraw from the deal under Article   2205 second I will announce our   withdrawal from the trans-pacific   partnership a potential disaster for our   country   third I will direct my secretary of the   Treasury to labour China a currency   manipulator China is a currency   manipulator what they have done to us by   playing currency is very sad and I don't   blame them they've been very smart I   blame our politicians for letting this   take place so easy to stop so easy to   stand forth I will direct the Secretary   of Commerce and US Trade Representative   to identify all foreign trading abuses   that unfairly impact American workers   and direct them to use every tool under   American and international law to end   those abuses immediately fifth very   importantly I will lift the restrictions   on the production of 50 trillion dollars   worth of job producing American energy   reserves including including shale oil   natural gas and clean coal and we will   put our miners back to work   six I will lift the obama-clinton   roadblocks that allow for this vital   energy infrastructure projects to go   forward we have roadblocks like you've   never ever seen environmental blocks   structural blocks we're going to allow   the Keystone pipeline and so many other   things to move forward tremendous   numbers of jobs and good for our country   we're going to cancel billions and   payments to the united nations climate   change programs and use the money to fix   America's water and environmental   infrastructure we're paying billions and   billions and billions of dollars we're   going to fix our own environment   additionally on the first day I will   take the following five actions to   restore security and constitutional rule   of law we have to do that cancel every   unconstitutional executive action   memorandum and order issued by president   obama   second begin the process of selecting a   replacement for Justice Scalia whose   wife by the way has a trump sign his   wife is a phenomenal woman has a trump   sign in her front yard isn't that nice I   just found that out this morning mom   isn't that nice he was great from one of   the 20 judges on my list you know we're   going to make great decisions from 20   outstanding judges on a list that we   submitted who will uphold and defend the   Constitution of the United States third   we will cancel all federal funding of   sanctuary cities   or we will begin removing the more than   two million criminal illegal immigrants   from the country these are our drug   dealers gang heads gang members killers   and cancel visas to foreign countries   that won't take them back   and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary   of State and they had someone who was   bad really bad and they brought him back   to the country in the country wouldn't   take him she said we'll bring them back   we don't want to force the country to   take them there won't be one such   instance if I become president believe   me we're going to suspend immigration   from Terra prone regions where vetting   cannot safely occur and if you look at   Syria and the migration we're taking in   thousands and thousands of people into   our country we have no idea who they are   what their thought process is where they   come from and Hillary Clinton wants to   increase the number of those thousands   and thousands currently pouring in by   five hundred and fifty percent radical   Islamic terror is right around the   corner we have to be so tough so smart   so vigilant we can't allow that to   happen we have enough problems   all that in a people coming into our   country will be considered extreme   vetting we will be very careful next I   will work with Congress to introduce the   following broader legislative measures   and fight for their passage within the   first 100 days of my administration   middle class tax relief and   simplification act an economic plan   designed to grow the economy four   percent per year and create at least 25   million new jobs through massive tax   reduction and simplification in   combination with trade reform regulatory   relief and lifting the restrictions on   American energy you got so bad jobs we   need jobs our jobs have left us our good   jobs have really left us the largest tax   reductions are for the middle class who   have been forgotten called the forgotten   man and woman they have been forgotten   the middle class with family of two   children will get basically   approximately thirty-five percent tax   cut and that's what they can use and   that money will go back into the economy   the current number of brackets will be   reduced from seven to three and tax   forms will likewise be greatly   simplified the business rate will be   lowered from thirty five percent to   fifteen percent and the trillions of   dollars of American corporate money   overseas can now be brought back at a   ten percent rate it's stuck we can't   bring it back two and a half to five   trillion dollars companies can't get it   back into the country some companies are   actually leaving not only because taxes   are so high but because they can't get   their money and they are actually   leaving to get their money we are going   to simplify that we're going to have   them bring to our country and use the   money and spend the money on building   our country   [Music]   and the offshoring act established   tariffs to discourage companies from   laying off their workers in order to   relocate in other countries and ship   their products back to the United States   tax-free they leave the United States   like carrier like Ford like so many   others they leave the United States they   fire all of their employees they go to   Mexico or another country they build a   beautiful brand new plant they hire   other people they then take their air   conditioners their cars whatever they're   making they send it tax-free of course   what will be a very strong border   believe me but they send to tax free   across the border and what do we end up   with we have unemployment tremendous   losses and we have none of the benefits   so we will establish tariffs that when   they do that there will be consequences   will work with them will be nice will be   fair but there has to be consequences   and when they know there are   consequences our companies will stop   leaving the United States and going to   other countries   the American infrastructure leverages   public-private partnerships and private   investments through tax incentives to   spare one trillion dollars in   infrastructure investment over the next   ten years our infrastructure is in such   trouble we've doubled our national debt   to 20 trillion dollars under President   Obama in less than eight years 10   trillion dollars has been added think of   it and we haven't fixed anything we   haven't fixed anything what have we done   our roads are broken our bridges or   tunnels or hospitals or schools and we   have 20 trillion in debt all-time high   that's true our VA hospitals are in bad   shape and on VA is a very very bad shape   and we will fix that we are going to   work on fixing that because our veterans   have not been treated properly we have   the legal immigrants that are treated   far better in many instances than our   veterans and we're not going to have   that school choice and education   opportunity act redirects education   dollars to give parents the right to   send their kid their children to public   private charter magnet religious or home   schools of their choice   and so importantly we're going to end   common core and bring education   supervision to local communities would   you so badly on education if you look at   the lists and you see Sweden Norway   Denmark China different countries at the   time you see us at the bottom and yet by   far per-pupil more money than anybody   and it's not even close we spend more   money for people than anybody not even   plus were at the bottom of the list   other countries spending far less per   pupil are at the top of the list so   obviously our current system is not   working we will change it and we will   make it good it expands vocational and   technical education which we've totally   forgotten about in this country and make   two and four-year colleges more   affordable have you ever gone to school   and you've been with people that aren't   good students but they can fix an engine   or they can build a wall or they can do   things that you wouldn't even think   about because we can use some of the   ones that build the wall we're going to   need them we're gonna need   but did you ever see that how their   genius at fixing a car they can do   anything but history not so good physics   not so good I mean we have to open   vocational again those are the people   that he's a great people the repeal and   replace Obamacare act   [Applause]   fully repeal Obamacare and replace it   with health savings account so we could   do that the health savings accounts one   way there are numerous ways but this is   one very good way the ability to   purchase health insurance across state   lines which we have to do because that's   competition the politicians won't let go   of it because the insurance companies   they don't want competition but we'll   open it up believe me we'll get rid of   that I've been saying it for years and   let States manage Medicaid funds it will   be so good reforms will also include   cutting the red tape at the FDA there   are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval   and we especially want to speed the   approval of life-saving medications mean   they're looking at drugs that are   looking very good and you have terminal   patients that it's over these people   that dying they want to get the drug   they won't be living much longer and we   study it for years and years at some   point they have to do what they have to   do they have to do it properly but we   have 4,000 different drugs and products   waiting in line for approval and we   can't get them approved we're going to   speed up that process very significantly   affordable childcare and Elder Care Act   allows Americans to deduct child care   and elder care from their taxes   incentivizes employers to provide   on-site so important childcare services   and you see that with a couple of   companies and it's such a great thing to   see and creates tax-free dependent care   savings accounts for both young and   elderly dependence with matching   contributions for low-income families so   good   and illegal immigration act fully funds   the construction of a wall on our   southern border don't worry about it   remember I said Mexico's paying for the   war with the full understanding that the   country of Mexico will be reimbursing   the United States for the full cost of   such a wall okay we're going to have the   wall Mexico's going to pay for the wall   Mexico's by the way I met with the   President of Mexico two and a half   months ago wonderful meeting wonderful   person but I told him this is a two-way   Highway not a one-way highway we have   our we have to take care of our people   we have to protect our people so it's   got to be a two-way street otherwise   going to be a whole different deal but   it establishes a two-year mandatory   minimum federal prison sentences as   people coming in illegally for illegally   re-entering the United States after a   previous deportation and a 5-year   mandatory minimum for illegally   reentering for those with felony   convictions multiple misdemeanor   convictions or two or more prior   deportations so when somebody comes in   we send them out they come back in to go   to prison quite a while they come back   they come back again they go five years   because what's happening is they're   coming back ten times and I could go   case after case they come back look at   what happened in San Francisco five   times he came back on the fifth time he   killed Kate five times but so many   others 110 times came back killed   somebody after ten times when they get   deported they stay out otherwise they   have very serious prison terms they will   stay out once you do that they will stay   out right now they have   consequence they have no consequences   also reforms on visa rules to enhance   penalties for overstaying and to ensure   open jobs are offered to American   workers first number eight restoring   Community Safety Act reduces surging   crime drugs and violence by creating a   task force on violent crime and   increasing funding for programs that   train and assist your local police were   doing such a great job believe me we   increase the resources for federal law   enforcement agencies and federal   prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs   and put violent offenders behind bars or   out of our country and into the country   where they came from restoring National   Security Act which rebuilds our military   by eliminate the defense sequester which   has been very tough on our military and   expanding military investment now at no   time practically do we need a military   like right now we don't want to use it   but it's peace through strength we need   a strong military our military is so   terribly depleted it also provides a   great veterans with the ability to   receive public VA treatment or attend a   private doctor of their choice if   they're waiting on line and I have the   plan up and we've gotten as you know   tremendous support from veterans from   law enforcement from veterans from the   military tremendous support but if   they're waiting on line and you see it   22 suicides a day people don't even   believe 22 a day but if they're waiting   in line for seven days six days nine   days they can't get to see a doctor and   a simple procedure or a simple   prescription can solve their problem and   they become very sick   and they die they die waiting in line   we're going to give them the power to go   across the street to a local doctor a   private doctor a public hospital or   private hospital all looking to help and   all looking to do business and we'll pay   the bill so much cheaper but much more   importantly the veterans will finally be   taken care of properly because what   they're going through now is   unacceptable   also we're going to protect our vital   infrastructure from the new thing it's   called cyber attack it establishes new   screening procedures for immigration to   ensure those who are admitted to our   country support our people and our   values we want people that love our   country or candle of our country and   people that will love our citizens we   want people that can love us and there   are ways through talent of determining   that and other countries do but we don't   just come on in folks come on in clean   up corruption in Washington act in acts   tough new ethic reforms to reduce the   corrupting influence of special   interests and donors on our politics on   november eighth americans will be voting   for this 100-day plan to restore   prosperity to our country secure our   communities and honesty to our   government this is my pledge to you and   if we follow these steps we will once   more have a government of By and For the   People and importantly we will make   America great again believe me   thank you thank you   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you
